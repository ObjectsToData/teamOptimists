## Research Question
  1.What does the New York Times cover about the Humanities?(which fields?/regulations or content?) On what page is this published? Comparison with other newspapers? Has it changed over time?
  2.How have the articles been categorized? Is this automated? How does this algorithm work? Or do humans categorize and how is this done?
  
## Approach
  1.Define queries + export CSV to google refine(timeline) + correlate with other newspaper API's
  1.What tags or facets are there + compare to other disciplines + correlate with other newspaper API's + Check for algorithms

## Insight
  1.How 'important' is the discipline to NYT-readers and has it changed over time?
  2.How does the NYT categorize and see the discipline of Humanities?
  
## Alternative research
  1. Doing a research using the media attached to the articles would also be interesting.
  2. Correlating the number of students enrolling to the studies within the Humanities would also be interesting but hard to find.
  3. Researching the sources used to write the articles would also be interesting.
