## Research Question

Are there changes in how the Humanities have been portrayed trough images over time? -Can we recognise patterns in there?
-
## Value of the data

Our question is based on the dataset and the possibilities it gives us. We hope that the data presents us with patterns that we can exploit for our question. The NYT is very appropriate for this because this because it has digitised everything and goes back over the whole history of photography.

## Steps

We want to create alot visualisations grouped by similarities. For instance:
- Time
- Subject (attained trough text analysis)
- Discipline
- Color (trough image analysis)
- (Face recognition)

To do this we will initially follow these steps:
1. Figure out how to get some output from imageplot.
2. Constructing the most basic dataset to get our own plot, containing the paths and dates.
3. Explore output
4. Iterate
