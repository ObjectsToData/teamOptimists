He was 83.</p>\n<p>As president from 1998 till 2003, Mr. Kim was the first opposition leader to take power in South Korea.</p>\n<p>Once vilified by his rivals as a Communist, Mr. Kim flew to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, in 2000 to meet that nation's leader, Kim Jong-il, in the first summit meeting between the Koreas. That meeting led to an unprecedented d&#233;tente on the divided Korean Peninsula, which remains technically at war because no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.</p>\n<p>Under Mr. Kim's \"Sunshine Policy,\" the two Koreas breached their border to connect roads and railways. They built a joint industrial park. Two million South Koreans visited a North Korean mountain resort. And in a scene televised worldwide, aging Koreans separated by the war a half century ago tearfully hugged one another in temporary family reunions.</p>\n<p>\"Through his political dedication and persecution, he has come to symbolize South Korea's democratization,\" Kang Won-taek, a political scientist at Soongsil University in Seoul, said. \"He also broke longstanding taboos in South Korea - he led the liberals to the fore of South Korean politics after decades of conservative rule, and he changed North Korea's status among South Koreans from an enemy to be vilified to someone that can coexist with the South and can be engaged.\"</p>\n<p>But Mr. Kim \"never overcame the limits\" of an old-style South Korean political boss who had depended on and stoked regionalism and \"privately owned political parities,\" which he created and demolished for his own political gains, Mr. Kang said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim became a symbol of the South Korean struggle for democracy and the dream of reconciliation, and eventual reunification, with North Korea. When the Nobel Committee awarded him the Peace Prize in 2000, it was in recognition of his struggle as a pro-democracy campaigner as well as his vision in overcoming five decades of mistrust and hostility to engineer the Korean summit meeting.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim spent his last years lamenting his crumbling legacy. Tired of giving billions of dollars of aid and trade to the Communist North but getting little in return, South Koreans in 2007 abandoned the policies of Mr. Kim and his successor, Roh Moo-hyun, by electing Lee Myung-bak, a conservative leader who promised a tougher stance on Pyongyang.</p>\n<p>Inter-Korean relations chilled as North Korea tested nuclear weapons, first in 2006 and again in May 2009, and as the United States, South Korea and Japan led the call for tighter sanctions on North Korea.</p>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Kim Dae-jung"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92e3a38f0d807d7762626","word_count":"459"}

A month later, her book was <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118056687\">optioned for a television series</a> by Fox Television and Imagine Television, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer&#8217;s production company.</p>\n<p>A New York Times interview with Ms. Belluck about her book can be found <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/there-once-was-a-surgeon-from-nantucket/?hpw\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Also in June 2012, Ms. Belluck was the subject of an extended profile in Current Biography magazine.</p>\n<p>Ms. Belluck&#8217;s reporting launched The Times&#8217;s Vanishing Mind series, about Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and dementia. For the first story, she traveled to mountain villages outside Medellin, Colombia, and wrote about an extraordinary extended family of 5,000 people, the world&#8217;s largest family to experience Alzheimer&#8217;s. Subsequently, the federal government awarded a grant to an unprecedented project to test a drug on the Colombian family to see if Alzheimer&#8217;s can be prevented. Also for the series, Ms. Belluck traveled to South Korea and Arizona, and spent time in a California men&#8217;s prison where first-degree murderers care for inmates with dementia. Several stories have been accompanied by groundbreaking multimedia projects produced with colleagues in the Times&#8217;s photo, video and multimedia departments.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...</a></p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n<p>In addition to her writing at The Times, Ms. Belluck conducts interviews for the weekly Science Times podcast.</p>\n<p>Ms. Belluck joined The Times in 1995 as a general assignment reporter on the metropolitan desk, served as the bureau chief in Queens, and briefly covered education in New York City. She was a key member of the team covering the Oklahoma City bombing and the crash of TWA Flight 800.</p>\n<p>In 1997, she became the Midwest bureau chief, based in Chicago and covering 11 states. In late 2001, she became the New England bureau chief, based in Boston. As a national bureau chief, she covered some of the biggest news stories, including the clergy sex abuse scandal in the Catholic church, the Rhode Island night club fire that killed 100 people, the introduction of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, and the passage of a landmark Massachusetts law requiring health insurance coverage for nearly everyone &#8212; which became the model of the national health care law.</p>\n<p>While a national correspondent, Ms. Belluck frequently worked on in-depth projects, exploring the demolition of a notorious public housing project in Chicago, the underpinnings of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, problems with the nation&#8217;s food-safety system, and the challenging life of a family coping with a mentally ill child.</p>\n<p>She was drawn to offbeat subjects as well: floating islands, truck stop evangelists, a North Dakota mayor who won election in a coin flip, and the longest place name in the country: Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg. A story about the sport of fish shooting was selected for The Best American Sports Writing 2005.</p>\n<p>In 2007, Ms. Belluck was awarded a Knight Fellowship to spend a year studying science journalism at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. In 2009, she began covering health and science for The Times.</p>\n<p>Her work has won several awards, and she was twice part of teams that were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. She graduated with honors from Princeton University with a major in international relations and a minor in East Asian studies. She was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship. These days, her French and Mandarin are rusty, but she studies Chinese when she can to refresh some of her knowledge of the language.</p>\n<p>Prior to joining The Times, Ms. Belluck worked for The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and as a freelance Southeast Asia correspondent for The San Francisco Chronicle and other newspapers. In the latter post, she wrote stories from China, Burma, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, where she once sang Frank Sinatra&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ve Got You Under My Skin&#8221; in order to persuade the Philippine military to take her to a strategically sensitive island in the South China Sea.</p>\n<p>Usually, she doesn&#8217;t have to sing in the course of reporting stories.

Then it was General Tso's chicken and sesame noodles. </p>\n<p>But over the past decade, as large communities of people from India, Peru, Korea, Trinidad and Guyana have formed in New York and elsewhere, ideas of what Chinese food can be have expanded. </p>\n<p>\"I call them second-generation Chinese restaurants,\" said Cheuk Kwan, who has directed a documentary film about the spread of Chinese restaurants around the world. </p>\n<p>Dishes like chili-spiked, deep-fried chicken lollipops, which are a Chinese-Indian specialty, and lo mein topped with chunks of peppery jerk chicken are what Chinese food is now to many. </p> \n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>New York City’s first hyphenated version of the cuisine - after Chinese-American, of course - was Chinese-Cuban, which arrived in the 1960's, when thousands of Cubans of Chinese descent came to New York after Fidel Castro's rise to power.</p> \n<p>Seafood soups, fried rice with pork, scallions and tiny shrimp, and chicharrones de pollo - chicken cut into small pieces and deep-fried in the Cantonese style - were and are standbys. </p> \n<p>Over the years, as more Americans have visited China and more Chinese have immigrated to the United States, more authentic versions of Chinese food have come to town on a gust of hot chilies, Sichuan peppercorns and bean paste. Restaurants serving the cuisines of Taiwan, Shanghai and Fujian have opened in the city's burgeoning Chinatowns - Flushing in Queens and Sunset Park and Homecrest in Brooklyn. </p>\n<p>When New York's young Korean-Americans go out for Chinese food, they often eat ja jiang mien, boiled noodles in a rich meat sauce, mixed with Korean brown bean paste and studded with Chinese fermented black beans.  </p>\n<p>In Elmhurst, Queens, La Union, a Peruvian chifa (slang for Chinese restaurant), serves platters of chancho, a Hispanic rendering of char siu, Chinese for roast pork.</p>\n<p>The roots of these hybrid Chinese cuisines around the world are the same as those of Chinese food in America. Millions of Chinese men, most of them from the province Guangdong (formerly known in English as Canton), left China in the late 19th and early 20th century. Only men were allowed to leave the country, often by becoming indentured workers to companies in need of cheap labor in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and South America. </p>\n<p>Professional cooks were usually not among the emigrants, so the earliest Chinese restaurants outside China were started by men with little knowledge of cooking and a desperate need to improvise with local ingredients. The dishes they came up with, like chop suey, have long since been dismissed as \"not Chinese\" by scholars of the culture. </p>\n<p>But Chinese food has never been quite what outsiders think it is. </p>\n<p>\"The term Chinese food represents an area four times larger than Western Europe and the eating habits of more than a billion people,\" Mr. Kwan said. \"You could say that there is really no such thing as Chinese food.\" </p>\n<p>Eugene Anderson, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Riverside, and author of \"The Food of China,\" disagreed. \"Chinese food is defined by a flavor principle of soy sauce, ginger, garlic and green onions\" and methods including stir-frying and steaming, he said. \"Once you get too far away from those rules, it is no longer Chinese.\" <em style=\"i\">— Excerpted and adapted from “Craving Hyphenated Chinese,” by Julia Moskin, The Times, Sept. 21, 2005.
