I turned to beans and to mushrooms, and came up with some delicious combinations that have great texture and flavor, with lots of vegetables included in the mix.

These delicious little packages are dense with nutrients, an excellent source of manganese, copper and tryptophan. Particularly noteworthy for their omega-3 fats, walnuts are also high in antioxidants. In a recent Spanish study, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with walnuts was shown to significantly lower risk factors for heart disease.</p>\n<p>Walnuts are used in sweet and savory dishes throughout the Mediterranean. Along the Italian Riviera, a rich ricotta and walnut sauce traditionally is served with ravioli filled with greens. In Turkey, a thick, garlicky walnut sauce called tarator is served with cooked vegetables, much as a&#239;oli is in the South of France.</p>\n<p>In France, walnuts are added to salads, breads and many desserts, and they are eaten fresh as well as dried - a great delicacy in the fall, just after the harvest. I've never encountered creamy, fresh walnuts in American farmers' markets, but if you know a walnut farmer, perhaps you could request some the next time they're harvested.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Recipes for Health: Walnuts"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Health","subsection_name":"Fitness & Nutrition","byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"527ac54438f0d86606633d0a","word_count":"182"}

I have fond memories of the hash that always came a  day or two after the big meal, crusty and savory and sweet with  ketchup.</p>\n<p>What tweaked my memory was a spicy lentil hash with farro that Dan  Coudreaut, the executive chef at (are you ready?) McDonald&#8217;s, made in  response to the following culinary challenge put to him at this year&#8217;s  Worlds of Healthy Flavors conference at the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/culinary_institute_of_america/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Culinary Institute of America</a> in Northern California: &#8220;What would you put on your breakfast menu if  your V.P. of food and beverage said he wanted three new breakfast  offerings that feature vegetables (including legumes)?&#8221; Mr. Coudreaut&#8217;s  idea was to offer three <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/v/vegetarianism/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">vegetarian</a> hashes topped with poached egg.</p>\n<p>Those dishes were more focused on legumes and grains than the hashes I  developed for this week&#8217;s column. One of them is made with ground  turkey breast, but the others are mixtures of diced vegetables,  sometimes bulked up with grains.</p>\n<p>As I made these dishes, I sought the savory, caramelized crusty edge I  so loved in the traditional hash of my youth. Ketchup had a lot to do  with it, and I&#8217;ve included ketchup in one of this week&#8217;s recipes. But  you can also get the same caramelization with tomato paste, a  concentrated source of wonderful antioxidants and <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/vitamins/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">vitamins</a>.  The vegetable hashes can be served as a main dish if topped with a  poached egg, and they make great side dishes.

She was born in London on September 28, 1933, the daughter of the late Francis and Florence (Pratt) Powell. Jane was pre-deceased by her three sisters, Edie Papps, Anne Remsen and Sonia Powell and is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Lois and Charley Cheston (of Topsfield, MA) and nine nieces and nephews, Janie Bellenis, Fizz Papps, Elizabeth Papps, John Papps, Rick Remsen, Jay Remsen, Lita Remsen, Chip Cheston and Virginia Spencer. She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT, and Briarcliff College in New York. Jane was deeply involved in various organizations, including Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, the American Association of Birth Centers, The Hallelujah Singers of Beaufort, South Carolina, and Good Hope Corporation, Ridgeland, South Carolina where she served as President of the Board for the past 30 years. As a young woman she dedicated much of her time to the Frontier Nursing Service of Hyden, Kentucky, and this became a lifelong passion. She was an active and involved member of the Jasper County community. Jane's love of her home, the South Carolina Low Country, its flora, fauna and community, guided and enriched her life. She was an avid and talented gardener. Bird hunting - at various locations around the world - was her passion. Nowhere was this sport more loved or aggressively pursued than hunting turkey in the dawn woods at Good Hope Plantation. A celebration of Jane's life with her family and friends will take place at a later date. There is no service planned.

Jane was pre-deceased by her three sisters, Edie Papps, Anne Remsen and Sonia Powell and is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Lois and Charley Cheston (of Topsfield, MA) and nine nieces and nephews, Janie Bellenis, Fizz Papps, Elizabeth Papps, John Papps, Rick Remsen, Jay Remsen, Lita Remsen, Chip Cheston and Virginia Spencer. She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, CT, and Briarcliff College in New York. Jane was deeply involved in various organizations, including Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, the American Association of Birth Centers, The Hallelujah Singers of Beaufort, South Carolina, and Good Hope Corporation, Ridgeland, South Carolina where she served as President of the Board for the past 30 years. As a young woman she dedicated much of her time to the Frontier Nursing Service of Hyden, Kentucky, and this became a lifelong passion. She was an active and involved member of the Jasper County community. Jane's love of her home, the South Carolina Low Country, its flora, fauna and community, guided and enriched her life. She was an avid and talented gardener. Bird hunting - at various locations around the world - was her passion. Nowhere was this sport more loved or aggressively pursued than hunting turkey in the dawn woods at Good Hope Plantation.
