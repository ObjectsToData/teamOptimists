Some pinpoint its place of origin as the Kalahari desert. Watermelons were being harvested 5,000 years ago in Egypt and can be seen in hieroglyphics. They were placed in burial tombs to nourish the dead in the afterlife.</p>\n\n<p> In the 10th century, this fruit spread to China and all of Asia. The Moors were taking the watermelon, along with tiles and algebra, through Europe in the 13th century. It was in Central America by 1516. The American colonies were growing watermelons from seeds in the early 1600's. </p> \n\n<p>The watermelon was always an important fruit because it traveled well in its own oblong or round ''container,'' and it would keep for weeks. The Japanese even improved on this several years ago with square, stackable melons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n<p>The watermelon is a perfect natural food. Its moist and easy nature launched many legends, including that of the Watermelon King. (See Daniel Wallace's novel of the same name set in Ashland, Ala. His myth? Every year a king is crowned who is the town's oldest virgin. He wears a carved watermelon rind crown and holds a watermelon vine scepter. He must mate before the festival ends.) </p>\n\n<p>Today there are scores of watermelon festivals all over the United States, including the famous Luling Watermelon Thump in Texas, the annual Hampton County festival in South Carolina, the Mize festival in Mississippi and Watermelon Day in Vining, Minn. . . . </p>\n\n<p>No wonder they still grow watermelons as a year-round staple in 44 states, with Florida, Texas, California, Georgia and Arizona leading in production. They are a booming business, with chefs constantly thinking up new and unusual things. <em style=\"i\">—  Excerpted from “Forbidden Fruit,” by Liz Smith, The Times, March 30, 2003</em>  </p>   \n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Watermelons"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"520d255838f0d8740ac8bc12","word_count":"327"}

She died at age 64 in 1994 in New York.</p>\r\n<p>Although Mrs. Onassis was one of the world's most famous women &#8212; an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the president's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis &#8212; she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.</p>\r\n<p>They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.</p>\r\n<p>She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become president.</p>\r\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...</a></p>\r\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\r\n<p>But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the Senate and was already being discussed as a presidential possibility, they were married at Newport,  R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.</p>\r\n<p>And after Mr. Kennedy won the presidency in 1960, Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture. She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th-century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana.</p>\r\n<p>The images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22,  1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the  Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding  motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis. It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given the Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American.</p>\r\n<p>While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Onassis began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. In 1978, she took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows.</p>\r\n<p>At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Her books included Bill Moyers's \"Healing and the Mind\"; Michael Jackson's \"Moonwalk\"; and Edvard Radzinsky's \"The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II.\" Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, \"Palace Walk,\" \"Palace of Desire\" and \"Sugar Street\" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Onassis was also known for her efforts to preserve historic New York buildings.</p>\r\n<p>She had two children, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr.</p>\r\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\r\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92dfa38f0d807d776255c","word_count":"766"}

He won great fame in the 1930s and ’40s with his lavishly detailed and savagely effective anti-Nazi cartoons. He died in 1951 at age 57. </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Szyk’s crowning achievement was his illustrated version of the Haggadah, the sacred Jewish work that tells the story of the exodus of the Jews from Egypt.  He worked for four years to illustrate in full colors and illuminate in gold the Hebrew text. The work appeared on vellum. This masterpiece, the first copy of which was presented to King George VI of Britain, was published in England in 1941 and its first edition was limited to 240 copies. </p>\n\n<p>The Studio, a British art publication, called the work “a magnificent production” that “was assured of a treasured place among the outstanding books of the world.” It termed Mr. Szyk “a master of his craft.” </p>\n\n<p>The German torture and murder of millions of Jews before and during World War II, in which his mother was one of those slain, led Mr. Szyk to use his talents as a cartoonist as an anti-Nazi weapon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>While his son, George, fought as a member of the Free French forces, Mr. Szyk struck hard and often against the Nazis with his art. He became a bitterly satirical political cartoonist in England, and, after his arrival in this country in 1941, in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>His cartoons appeared in many British and American publications, including The New York Post, Time, Life, PM, American Mercury, The Chicago Sun, Fortune and Collier’s. The cartoons were used too to inspire our Armed Forces, and were shown by our authorities for that purpose to the men at West Point and Annapolis and by the United Service Organizations in many Army recreation centers.</p>\n\n<p>Born in Lodz, Poland, son of Alexander Solomon Szyk, a textile mill owner, and Mrs. Eugenie Rogacka Szyk,  he began to paint at 4, made drawings of the Boxer Rebellion at 6 and held his first public exhibition while still a student in school. He went to business college but at 15 was permitted to go to Paris to study at the Julian Academy. After two years he decided that his field lay in manuscript illumination. He served an apprenticeship at Cracow and then studied Oriental art in the Near East.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Szyk saw front-line action during the first World War in the Russian army and was taken prisoner. Later, he was an officer in the Polish army against Russia. He became head of Polish art propaganda in the war with Russia and won a decoration for bravery.</p>\n\n<p>In 1921-31 he lived in Paris, where he steeped himself in the influences of the early masters. Among the hundreds of miniatures in his richly colored, semi-medieval style are some in the Luxembourg Palace and the National Library in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Szyk did a series of 38 miniatures, “Washington and His Times,” a two-year work, issued as a monumental portfolio for the Washington Bicentennial in 1932. Many of his miniatures decorated the Polish Building at the New York World’s Fair in 1939-40.</p>\n\n<p>His heroic war pictures included one of a British Tommy as St. George slaying the Nazi dragon. He illustrated “The Song of Songs,” “The Book of Esther,” the “Rubaiyat,” “Anderson’s Fairy Tales,” the “Canterbury Tales” and other books. Among the exhibitions of his work in recent years is one at the Deutsche Historische Museum in Berlin in 2008. <em style=\"i\">— Adapted from his 1951 obituary in The New York Times</em>  </p>   \n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div>\n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Szyk, Arthur"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"520d27dd38f0d8740ac8bc24","word_count":"613"}

Holbrooke, who had been the Obama administration's special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan since 2009, died on Dec. 13, 2010, after suffering a tear in his aorta.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke, a veteran diplomat who helped broker the peace accord that ended the war in Bosnia, became ill on Dec. 10, 2010, during a meeting with Secretary of State <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/hillary_rodham_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>. He was able to walk out of Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s office to seek medical attention, and underwent emergency surgery on Dec. 11.</p>\n<p>As the senior policy maker on the administration&#8217;s most pressing foreign policy issue, Mr. Holbrooke helped shape the civilian component of the administration&#8217;s Afghanistan strategy, deploying more than 1,000 diplomats and aid workers to help the Afghans rebuild their state institutions.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke was portrayed by some as disruptive and his relationship with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan chilled after difficult meetings following the August 2009 election.</p>\n<p>In one episode that dramatized the building animosities in the Obama administration, Gen. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/james_l_jones/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=james%20l%20jones&amp;st=cse\">James L. Jones</a>, the national security adviser, wrote to Ambassador <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/karl_w_eikenberry/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=karl%20eikenberry&amp;st=cse\">Karl Eikenberry</a> in February 2010, sympathizing with his complaints about a visit Mr. Holbrooke had recently made to Afghanistan. In the note, which went out over unsecure channels, officials said, General Jones soothed the ambassador by suggesting that Mr. Holbrooke would soon be removed from his position.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...</a></p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n<p>The note prompted Mrs. Clinton to complain to Mr. Obama, and her support for Mr. Holbrooke kept him in his job.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke also clashed with Gen. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/stanley_a_mcchrystal/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=stanley%20mcchrystal&amp;st=cse\">Stanley A. McChrystal</a>, Mr. Obama's top commander in Afghanistan, who was fired on June 23, 2010, after disdainful remarks he and his staff made about top administration officials in a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236\">Rolling Stone article</a>.</p>\n<p>A McChrystal aide was quoted in the article saying of Mr. Holbrooke: ''The Boss says he's like a wounded animal. Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to be fired, so that makes him dangerous.'' On another occasion, General McChrystal was described as reacting with exasperation when he received an e-mail message from Mr. Holbrooke. ''Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke. I don't even want to open it.''</p>\n<p>General <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/david_h_petraeus/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=petraeus&amp;st=cse\">David H. Petraeus</a>, who formerly oversaw all military forces in the Middle East and took over as commander in Afghanistan, said Mr. Holbrooke had been his \"wingman\" and that the two had a \"very good relationship.\"</p>\n<p>Officials had said that Mr. Holbrooke's job security was less in doubt than it was in early 2010, when his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he had arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, now manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's most recent portfolio played to his weaknesses, his own allies admitted. He was best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke had become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs under President Jimmy Carter, and assistant secretary of state for European affairs and then United States ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton. Early in his career, he served as Peace Corps director in Morocco in 1970, and as editor of Foreign Policy magazine from 1972 to 1976.</p>\n<p>He was passed over for secretary of state in 1996, when Mr. Clinton instead chose Madeleine K. Albright.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke was well known in the Washington foreign-policy establishment, among journalists and overseas. During the conflict in August 2008 between Russia and Georgia, he was one of the first Americans to fly to Tbilisi to meet with the Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili, a friend.</p>\n<p>He was born April 24, 1941, in New York City and graduated from Brown  University in 1962.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Holbrooke, Richard C."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92d6d38f0d807d7762380","word_count":"711"}
