Mr. Mugniyah, a senior leader of Hezbollah, the Shiite militia, was one of the world's most wanted men for more than two decades. He died on Feb. 12, 2008, killed in Damascus, Syria by a car bomb.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Mugniyah was believed to have been behind attacks in 1983 on the United States Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the terrorist hijacking of a T.W.A. jetliner in 1985, and a series of high-profile kidnappings in the 1980’s. There have also been accusations that his organization may have been involved in the bombing of the Khobar Towers military residence in Saudi Arabia in 1996, in which 17 Americans were killed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>Born in south Lebanon, Mr. Mugniyah came of age during the civil war of the 1970's, during which the country's long-neglected Shiite population first emerged as a political force. He is believed to have joined Hezbollah in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and his success in the bombings against U.S. targets, which killed a total of 258 Americans, propelled him into its upper ranks. Since then, his role has been murky and he has lived a life of exceptional secrecy. American intelligence officials have said that he has been supported by Iran, and taken a lead role in developing Hezbollah's ability to conduct operations throughout the region. Mr. Mugniyah is reported to have survived and eluded a number of attempts by American special forces to kill or capture him.</p>\n\n</p>In addition to the string of bombings, the United States also asserts he was behind the torture and murder of William Buckley, the C.I.A. station chief in Beirut, in 1984; the kidnapping and murder of Lt. Col. William Richard Higgins of the Marines, who was on peacekeeping duty in Lebanon in 1988; and, through the Islamic Jihad Organization, the seizure of Western hostages in Beirut during the 1980s.  <em style=\"i\">— Feb. 13, 2008</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Mugniyah, Imad"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92e2a38f0d807d77625f2","word_count":"356"}

They make up only 15 percent of Muslims, but they dominate in Iran, Iraq Azerbaijan and Bahrain, and have a plurality in Lebanon and Yemen. </p>\n\n<p>The groups within Islam first diverged after the Prophet Muhammad died in 632, and his followers could not agree on whether to choose bloodline successors or leaders most likely to follow the tenets of the faith. </p>\n\n<p>The group now known as Sunnis chose Abu Bakr, the prophet’s adviser, to become the first successor, or caliph, to lead the Muslim state. Shiites favored Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law. Ali and his successors are called imams, who not only lead the Shiites but are considered to be descendants of Muhammad. After the 11th imam died in 874, and his young son was said to have disappeared from the funeral, Shiites in particular came to see the child as a Messiah who had been hidden from the public by God. The largest sect of Shiites, known as “twelvers,’’ have been preparing for his return ever since. </p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>Violence between the sects began in 656, when the third caliph, revered by the Sunnis, was killed. Soon after, the Sunnis killed Ali’s son Husain. </p>\n\n<p>Sunnis emerged victorious over the Shiites and came to revere the caliphate for its strength and piety. Shiites, by contrast, continued to revere their imams and focus on developing their religious beliefs through them. </p>\n\n<p>In 931 the Twelfth Imam disappeared. This was a turning point in the history of Shi’ism. As R. Scott Appleby, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, explained: “Shiite Muslims, who are concentrated in Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, [believe they] had suffered the loss of divinely guided political leadership” at the time of the Imam’s disappearance. Not “until the ascendancy of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1978” in Iran did Shiites recognize the authority of a legitimate religious figure. </p>\n\n<p>Besides the “twelver” branch, which is the most significant, there are two other branches in Shi’ism: the Ismaili and Zaidi, who dispute the twelver beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>Shiites share fundamental theological beliefs with the Sunnis. They both agree on the five pillars of Islam: 1. the statement of faith that there is no God but God and Mohammed is his messenger; 2. the salah — the requirement to pray five times daily; 3. acceptance of a voluntary religious tax paid directly to the poor; 4. fasting for the entire month of Ramadan, unless physically impossible; 5. performing a pilgrimage to Mecca — the haj — at least once in a lifetime if financially and physically able. </p>\n\n<p>Many Shiites, in addition, make pilgrimages to the holy sites of Najaf, Kerbala, Samarra, and Kazimayn, “the holy thresholds” in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>--Adapted from \"Refresher Course:...Telling Sunni from Shiite,\" by Damien Cave, Week in Review, The New York Times, Dec. 17, 2006. \n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> \n \n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Shiite Muslims"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"5220c58138f0d8740ac9b8e7","word_count":"501"}
