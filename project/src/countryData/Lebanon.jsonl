Mr. Mugniyah, a senior leader of Hezbollah, the Shiite militia, was one of the world's most wanted men for more than two decades. He died on Feb. 12, 2008, killed in Damascus, Syria by a car bomb.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Mugniyah was believed to have been behind attacks in 1983 on the United States Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, the terrorist hijacking of a T.W.A. jetliner in 1985, and a series of high-profile kidnappings in the 1980’s. There have also been accusations that his organization may have been involved in the bombing of the Khobar Towers military residence in Saudi Arabia in 1996, in which 17 Americans were killed.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>Born in south Lebanon, Mr. Mugniyah came of age during the civil war of the 1970's, during which the country's long-neglected Shiite population first emerged as a political force. He is believed to have joined Hezbollah in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and his success in the bombings against U.S. targets, which killed a total of 258 Americans, propelled him into its upper ranks. Since then, his role has been murky and he has lived a life of exceptional secrecy. American intelligence officials have said that he has been supported by Iran, and taken a lead role in developing Hezbollah's ability to conduct operations throughout the region. Mr. Mugniyah is reported to have survived and eluded a number of attempts by American special forces to kill or capture him.</p>\n\n</p>In addition to the string of bombings, the United States also asserts he was behind the torture and murder of William Buckley, the C.I.A. station chief in Beirut, in 1984; the kidnapping and murder of Lt. Col. William Richard Higgins of the Marines, who was on peacekeeping duty in Lebanon in 1988; and, through the Islamic Jihad Organization, the seizure of Western hostages in Beirut during the 1980s.  <em style=\"i\">— Feb. 13, 2008</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Mugniyah, Imad"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92e2a38f0d807d77625f2","word_count":"356"}

They make up only 15 percent of Muslims, but they dominate in Iran, Iraq Azerbaijan and Bahrain, and have a plurality in Lebanon and Yemen. </p>\n\n<p>The groups within Islam first diverged after the Prophet Muhammad died in 632, and his followers could not agree on whether to choose bloodline successors or leaders most likely to follow the tenets of the faith. </p>\n\n<p>The group now known as Sunnis chose Abu Bakr, the prophet’s adviser, to become the first successor, or caliph, to lead the Muslim state. Shiites favored Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law. Ali and his successors are called imams, who not only lead the Shiites but are considered to be descendants of Muhammad. After the 11th imam died in 874, and his young son was said to have disappeared from the funeral, Shiites in particular came to see the child as a Messiah who had been hidden from the public by God. The largest sect of Shiites, known as “twelvers,’’ have been preparing for his return ever since. </p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>Violence between the sects began in 656, when the third caliph, revered by the Sunnis, was killed. Soon after, the Sunnis killed Ali’s son Husain. </p>\n\n<p>Sunnis emerged victorious over the Shiites and came to revere the caliphate for its strength and piety. Shiites, by contrast, continued to revere their imams and focus on developing their religious beliefs through them. </p>\n\n<p>In 931 the Twelfth Imam disappeared. This was a turning point in the history of Shi’ism. As R. Scott Appleby, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, explained: “Shiite Muslims, who are concentrated in Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, [believe they] had suffered the loss of divinely guided political leadership” at the time of the Imam’s disappearance. Not “until the ascendancy of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1978” in Iran did Shiites recognize the authority of a legitimate religious figure. </p>\n\n<p>Besides the “twelver” branch, which is the most significant, there are two other branches in Shi’ism: the Ismaili and Zaidi, who dispute the twelver beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>Shiites share fundamental theological beliefs with the Sunnis. They both agree on the five pillars of Islam: 1. the statement of faith that there is no God but God and Mohammed is his messenger; 2. the salah — the requirement to pray five times daily; 3. acceptance of a voluntary religious tax paid directly to the poor; 4. fasting for the entire month of Ramadan, unless physically impossible; 5. performing a pilgrimage to Mecca — the haj — at least once in a lifetime if financially and physically able. </p>\n\n<p>Many Shiites, in addition, make pilgrimages to the holy sites of Najaf, Kerbala, Samarra, and Kazimayn, “the holy thresholds” in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>--Adapted from \"Refresher Course:...Telling Sunni from Shiite,\" by Damien Cave, Week in Review, The New York Times, Dec. 17, 2006. \n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> \n \n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Shiite Muslims"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"5220c58138f0d8740ac9b8e7","word_count":"501"}

Whether dropped from aircraft or fired from artillery, cluster bombs can scatter dozens or even hundreds of smaller explosives across an area the size of a football field.</p>\n\n<p> Some bomblets fail to explode upon hitting the ground and, like landmines, can remain a deadly hazard to children, farmers and other civilians long after a conflict ends. Campaigners say cluster bombs should follow mustard gas and dum-dum bullets, high-velocity ammunition that often breaks apart upon impact, into a closed chapter of the history of warfare.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2008, dozens of nations in Oslo signed a treaty banning cluster bombs. Non-signers included some of the world's biggest military powers, among them  the United States, Russian and China.   Many of the signatories expressed concern that the treaty  fails to bind the countries most prone to military conflict. </p>\n\n<p>Washington, Moscow and other non-signers, including  India, Pakistan and most Middle Eastern states,  say cluster bombs have legitimate military uses such as repelling advancing troop columns. But according to the group Handicap International, 98 percent of cluster-bomb victims are civilians, and 27 percent are children.</p>\n\n<p>American officials defended their stance, saying that the United States has been developing advanced cluster munitions that were less likely to harm civilians and has provided nearly half of all global funding for the clearance of unexploded ordnance.</p>\n<p>Norway, which began the drive to ban cluster bombs 18 months ago, was the first to sign, followed by Laos and Lebanon, both hard-hit by the weapons. Britain, formerly a major stockpiler of cluster munitions, also signed the treaty. The treaty’s unequivocal language is meant to be so strong that even countries refusing to sign it will be reluctant to deploy the weapons or trade  them in commercially.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the many signatures gathered in Oslo, most countries will still require some legislative process to ratify the treaty. </p>\n<p>The convention will not enter into force until six months after the 30th nation has officially ratified it — a milestone that Norwegian organizers said could be achieved by 2009. </p>\n<p>Cluster bombs can cause casualties long after the conflict in which they were deployed is over. In Laos, unexploded cluster munitions are a legacy of United States bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam War. Old Russian-made bomblets still inflict casualties in Afghanistan and Chechnya. \nOne of the last confirmed uses of cluster bombs was in 2006, when Israel fired large numbers of them into southern Lebanon during a monthlong conflict with the militant group Hezbollah. Afterward, United Nations peacekeepers reported unexploded munitions strewn across the landscape. Accidental detonations have killed or maimed hundreds of civilians since then, human rights workers said. Human rights groups have also alleged that Georgia and Russia used cluster munitions extensively in their war in August, although both countries have challenged this.</p>\n\n<p>A NATO policy banning the use of cluster munitions in Afghanistan has been in place since 2007. Human Rights Watch estimates that hundreds of civilian casualties in the early stages of the Afghanistan War in 2001 were caused by cluster bombs dropped by the American Air Force. </p>\n\n<p>The lessons of Afghanistan led to a change by the Air Force, and in the Iraq invasion in 2003 there were very few civilians killed by air-dropped clusters, though hundreds of Iraqi civilians were killed in Iraq in 2003 by Army rocket clusters. According to Human Rights Watch, American forces have not used any cluster bombs since 2003.</p>\n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cluster Munitions"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"520d2f6338f0d8740ac8bc58","word_count":"588"}

To a nation battered by Vietnam, damaged by Watergate and humiliated by the taking of hostages in Iran, Ronald Reagan held out the promise of a return to greatness, the promise that America would ''stand tall'' again.</p>\n<p> He managed to project the optimism of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the faith in small-town America of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the vigor of John F. Kennedy. In his first term he restored much of America's faith in itself and in the presidency, and he rode into his second term on the crest of a wave of popularity. </p>\n<p> But late in 1986, halfway through his second term, Mr. Reagan and his administration were plunged into turmoil by Iran Contra. Contrary to official policy, Mr. Reagan's subordinates sold arms to Iran as ransom for hostages in Lebanon and diverted profits from the sales to the rebels fighting the Marxist Sandinistas then governing Nicaragua. A joint Congressional investigating committee reported that the affair had been ''characterized by pervasive dishonesty and secrecy'' and that Mr. Reagan bore ultimate responsibility for the wrongdoing of a ''cabal of zealots.\" </p>\n<p>But until the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Reagan enjoyed tremendous popularity. He used that popularity and a consummate political skill to push many of his major programs through Congress. And despite the affair, he crowned his two terms with a nuclear arms agreement with the Soviet Union that reduced the nuclear arsenals of both countries for the first time, setting the stage for a new relationship with the Soviets under the leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. </p>\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E0DA1131F935A35755C0A9629C8B63\"> Read full obituary </a>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Reagan, Ronald Wilson"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92db238f0d807d7762470","word_count":"306"}

Fred T. Ferguson, journalist, editor, and public relations professional died on Friday at New York Presbyterian Medical Center. He was eighty-two. A graduate of New York Military Academy, Ferguson, a veteran newsman with wide experience, began his career as a stringer on Pacific Stars and Stripes during the Korean War covering the southern Japanese Islands. In 1956, Ferguson began at United Press International as a copyboy, and worked his way up through the ranks of reporter and editor at bureaus in Jackson, MS, Mineaola, NY, Trenton and Newark, NJ. He later served as Regional Executive for New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. One of his fondest memories was escorting former President Harry S. Truman on his daily walks. In 1980, Ferguson won the New York Press Association's News Feature Award for a series he wrote on the advent of robotics in the US. Twenty-seven years later, Ferguson went onto begin his second career in Public Relations. After eight years at DAY (now Olgivy PR), PR Newswire hired him to coach their clients writing press releases. Public speaking expert, Dorothy Sarnoff, trained Ferguson to speak across the country on \"Writing press releases editors will notice.\" A favorite phrase of his was: \"Now I'm a flack instead of a hack!\" Never retiring, he went on to start his own consulting company: Fred-Editing Help, after leaving PR Newswire at the age of 77. To say he loved his work would be understatement. A great story teller, Ferguson spoke last spring at the National Hemophilia Foundation's Annual Soiree where he was honored for his work on the board. An energetic person, who continued to be motivated by his longtime girlfriend, Gloria Marti, Ferguson danced, skied, played tennis, ice skated, traveled extensively and was an avid opera and theater goer. He also raised his two children by himself, for the most part, at a time when that was not the norm. His son, Dr. Robert Ferguson of Paxton, MA survives him as well as his daughter, former Mayor, Lisa Uchrin of Lebanon, NJ, his granddaughter, Kyla Ferguson of Leeds, MA and his two grandsons, Zachary Ferguson of Boston, MA and George Uchrin, age 14. He was their beloved \"Pop Pop.\" In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the American Diabetes Association.

Throughout his life Bob was an avid skier and competitive tennis player. He was a charter member of the Stratton Mountain Country Club. He and his wife split their time between John's Island and Stratton Mountain with his last years spent in the serenity of their mountaintop Stratton home sustained by his caring and nurturing wife and bolstered by his wry wit and surprising courage. A private burial was held at the family plot in the Kenisco Cemetery, Valhalla, NY, on Wednesday July 23, 2014.

His father was a state auditor, which meant the family moved every few years to a new Ohio town while Neil was growing up. At the age of 6, Neil and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor airplane, known as the Tin Goose. It must have made an impression, for by the time he was 15, he had learned to fly, even before he got his driver&#8217;s license.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...</a></p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n<p>During the Korean War, Mr. Armstrong was in the unit that the author James A. Michener wrote of in &#8220;The Bridges at Toko-Ri.&#8221; Back at Purdue after the Navy, Mr. Armstrong plunged more earnestly into aeronautical engineering studies, his grades rising and a career in sight.</p>\n<p>By this time, he had also met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, a student in home economics from Evanston, Ill. Soon after his graduation, they were married, in January 1956.</p>\n<p>They had two sons, Eric and Mark, who survive. A daughter, Karen, died of an inoperable brain tumor in 1962. The couple were divorced in 1994; Janet Armstrong lives in Utah. In 1999, Mr. Armstrong married Carol Knight, a widow 15 years his junior; she also survives. They lived in Indian Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>After his first marriage, the newlyweds moved to California, where Mr. Armstrong had been hired as an experimental test pilot for the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, the forerunner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at Edwards Air Force Base. His first flight in a rocket plane was in the Bell X-1B, a successor to the plane Charles E. Yeager had first flown faster than the speed of sound.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong impressed his peers. Milt Thompson, one of the test pilots, said he was &#8220;the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots.&#8221; Another colleague, Bill Dana, said he &#8220;had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge and a memory that remembered them like a photograph.&#8221; He made seven X-15 flights at 4,000 miles per hour, reaching the edge of space, and piloted many more of the most innovative and dangerous aircraft ever developed.</p>\n<p><strong>A Career at NASA</strong></p>\n<p>In 1958, Mr. Armstrong was chosen as a consultant for a military space plane project, the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and was later named one of the pilots. But the young test pilot was attracted by another opportunity. NASA was receiving applications for the second group of astronauts, after the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/mercury_planet/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">Mercury</a> Seven. His reputation after seven years at the NASA flight center at Edwards had preceded him, and so he was tapped for the astronaut corps.</p>\n<p>At Houston, the new astronaut began training for flights in the two-person Gemini spacecraft, the successor to the smaller Mercury capsules and forerunner to the three-person Apollos. Mr. Armstrong became the first American civilian astronaut to fly in space, as commander of Gemini 8. He and his co-pilot, David R. Scott, were launched on March 16, 1966. They performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space, their Gemini linking with an unmanned Agena in an essential test for later operations on lunar flights.</p>\n<p>Next, Mr. Armstrong was the backup commander for Apollo 8, the first flight to circumnavigate the Moon, doing so at Christmastime in 1968. It was the mission that put Apollo back on track after a cockpit fire during a launching pad rehearsal had killed three astronauts in January 1967. And it put Mr. Armstrong in position to command Apollo 11.</p>\n<p>If everything went well with the lunar module test on Apollo 9 and with a shakedown flight to lunar orbit on Apollo 10, then Mr. Armstrong was in line to land on the Moon with Buzz Aldrin and with Michael Collins as the command module pilot. As the commander, NASA officials decided, Mr. Armstrong would be the first to walk on the Moon.</p>\n<p>After leaving the space program, Mr. Armstrong was careful to do nothing to tarnish that image or achievement. Though he traveled and gave speeches &#8212; as he did in October 2007, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byv8Dbq9uak]\">when he dedicated the new Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering</a> at Purdue &#8212; he rarely gave interviews and avoided the spotlight.</p>\n<p>For a time, he was an associate NASA administrator for aeronautics, but he tired of a Washington desk job. Ignoring many high-level offers in business and academia, he returned to Ohio as a professor of aeronautical engineering at the University of Cincinnati and bought a farm near Lebanon, Ohio. He also served as a director for several corporations.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Armstrong, Neil A.

Born Jan. 17, 1913 in Scranton, PA. He received his AB and DDS from the University of Pennsylvania and his MS in Bacteriology and Pathology from the University of Virginia. He was on the faculty at the Medical College of Virginia, Washington University (St. Louis), Columbia University, University of Texas in Houston, Texas A&M University. After retiring from the University of Texas at age 70 he taught at the University of California - San Francisco, University of California - San Diego, and Universidad National Autonoma de Mexico. He was considered a mentor by many of his students who went on to be professors themselves including at least two who became deans of dental schools. He was an accomplished artist. He did wood-carvings and mosaics and a stained glass window for a small synagogue in Houston. At an age when most people limit their physical activities, Bar was just getting started. While at the University of California - San Francisco he took up hang-gliding. When he was 75 he hiked the entire Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine and at the age of 78 he climbed Mt. Kilmanjaro. In his 80's he took hiking trips in Scotland and Italy. Pre-deceased by his wife Henrietta, he is survived by Jeffery, his daughter-in-law Toni Doktor, grandchildren Benjamin, Nolan and Ryan Doktor, nieces, nephews and cousins. He was a warm and generous man who was universally loved by all who came in contact with him and will be greatly missed by all. A memorial service will be held on Sunday June 8, 2014 at Mt. Lebanon Cemetery, 189 Gill lane in Iselin, NJ.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  LEVY, BARNET M."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-06-01T02:16:54Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c6f66738f0d858f3e38209","word_count":"284"}
