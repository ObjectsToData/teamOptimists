To a nation battered by Vietnam, damaged by Watergate and humiliated by the taking of hostages in Iran, Ronald Reagan held out the promise of a return to greatness, the promise that America would ''stand tall'' again.</p>\n<p> He managed to project the optimism of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the faith in small-town America of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the vigor of John F. Kennedy. In his first term he restored much of America's faith in itself and in the presidency, and he rode into his second term on the crest of a wave of popularity. </p>\n<p> But late in 1986, halfway through his second term, Mr. Reagan and his administration were plunged into turmoil by Iran Contra. Contrary to official policy, Mr. Reagan's subordinates sold arms to Iran as ransom for hostages in Lebanon and diverted profits from the sales to the rebels fighting the Marxist Sandinistas then governing Nicaragua. A joint Congressional investigating committee reported that the affair had been ''characterized by pervasive dishonesty and secrecy'' and that Mr. Reagan bore ultimate responsibility for the wrongdoing of a ''cabal of zealots.\" </p>\n<p>But until the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Reagan enjoyed tremendous popularity. He used that popularity and a consummate political skill to push many of his major programs through Congress. And despite the affair, he crowned his two terms with a nuclear arms agreement with the Soviet Union that reduced the nuclear arsenals of both countries for the first time, setting the stage for a new relationship with the Soviets under the leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. </p>\n<a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E0DA1131F935A35755C0A9629C8B63\"> Read full obituary </a>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Reagan, Ronald Wilson"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92db238f0d807d7762470","word_count":"306"}

His prior assignments included a stint writing about Muslims in North America, as well as five years from January 2001 through 2005 as the Cairo bureau chief, covering the swath of countries from Morocco to Iran. He spent most of his time in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iran, as well as occasional reporting from Iraq until the end of 2003. Whenever the violence of the region in those years abated, he tried to focus on topics that highlighted daily life - stories about stuff like anti-dog fatwas in Iran, the most famous Lebanese chef and a wildly popular comedy series on Saudi television. He spent his last year as the Mideast correspondent writing an in-depth series that profiled half a dozen men and women working for political and social change.</p>\n<p>Neil's exposure to the Middle East actually started early, at age three, when his father moved the family to Libya to work in the nascent oil industry. (He began his education at Esso Elementary School.) In total, Neil has spent more than 25 years in the region, including a seven-year stint as a correspondent for The Associated Press during which he lived in Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Cyprus. A fluid speaker of Arabic and French, he holds a B.A. in International Political Economy from Stanford University.</p>\n<p>Neil is the author of two books.

They make up only 15 percent of Muslims, but they dominate in Iran, Iraq Azerbaijan and Bahrain, and have a plurality in Lebanon and Yemen. </p>\n\n<p>The groups within Islam first diverged after the Prophet Muhammad died in 632, and his followers could not agree on whether to choose bloodline successors or leaders most likely to follow the tenets of the faith. </p>\n\n<p>The group now known as Sunnis chose Abu Bakr, the prophet’s adviser, to become the first successor, or caliph, to lead the Muslim state. Shiites favored Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law. Ali and his successors are called imams, who not only lead the Shiites but are considered to be descendants of Muhammad. After the 11th imam died in 874, and his young son was said to have disappeared from the funeral, Shiites in particular came to see the child as a Messiah who had been hidden from the public by God. The largest sect of Shiites, known as “twelvers,’’ have been preparing for his return ever since. </p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n\n<p>Violence between the sects began in 656, when the third caliph, revered by the Sunnis, was killed. Soon after, the Sunnis killed Ali’s son Husain. </p>\n\n<p>Sunnis emerged victorious over the Shiites and came to revere the caliphate for its strength and piety. Shiites, by contrast, continued to revere their imams and focus on developing their religious beliefs through them. </p>\n\n<p>In 931 the Twelfth Imam disappeared. This was a turning point in the history of Shi’ism. As R. Scott Appleby, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, explained: “Shiite Muslims, who are concentrated in Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon, [believe they] had suffered the loss of divinely guided political leadership” at the time of the Imam’s disappearance. Not “until the ascendancy of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1978” in Iran did Shiites recognize the authority of a legitimate religious figure. </p>\n\n<p>Besides the “twelver” branch, which is the most significant, there are two other branches in Shi’ism: the Ismaili and Zaidi, who dispute the twelver beliefs. </p>\n\n<p>Shiites share fundamental theological beliefs with the Sunnis. They both agree on the five pillars of Islam: 1. the statement of faith that there is no God but God and Mohammed is his messenger; 2. the salah — the requirement to pray five times daily; 3. acceptance of a voluntary religious tax paid directly to the poor; 4. fasting for the entire month of Ramadan, unless physically impossible; 5. performing a pilgrimage to Mecca — the haj — at least once in a lifetime if financially and physically able. </p>\n\n<p>Many Shiites, in addition, make pilgrimages to the holy sites of Najaf, Kerbala, Samarra, and Kazimayn, “the holy thresholds” in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>--Adapted from \"Refresher Course:...Telling Sunni from Shiite,\" by Damien Cave, Week in Review, The New York Times, Dec. 17, 2006. \n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> \n \n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Shiite Muslims"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"5220c58138f0d8740ac9b8e7","word_count":"501"}

Although Ms. Agha-Soltan, whom her relatives described as unpolitical, was killed on a quiet street and was not participating in any political rally when she was shot, she became an instant symbol of the anti-government movement when a video of her death was shared on social networking sites.</p>\r\n<p>Only scraps of information are known about Ms. Agha-Soltan. Her friends and relatives were mostly afraid to speak, and the government broke up public attempts to mourn her. She studied philosophy and took underground singing lessons - women are barred from singing publicly in Iran. Her name means voice in Persian, and many are now calling her the voice of Iran.</p>\r\n<p>Her fianc&#233;, Caspian Makan, contributed to a Persian Wikipedia entry. He said she never supported any particular presidential candidate. \"She wanted freedom, freedom for everybody,\" the entry read.</p>\r\n<p>Her singing instructor, Hamid Panahi, offered a glimpse of her last moments.</p>\r\n<p>He said the two of them had attempted to join a rally and decided to head home after being caught in a clash with club-wielding forces in central Tehran. The car was hot and they decided to step out for some fresh air. \"We heard one gunshot, and the bullet came and hit Neda right in the chest,\" he said. The shot was fired from the rooftop of a private house across the street, perhaps by a sniper, he said. On a Facebook posting along with the video, an anonymous doctor said he tried to save her but failed because the bullet hit her heart. \"It burned me,\" she said before she died.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after Ms. Agha-Soltan died, the man whose 40-second video of her death has ricocheted around the world made a somber calculation in what has become the cat-and-mouse game of evading Iran's censors. He knew that the government had been blocking Web sites like YouTube and Facebook. Trying to send the video there could have exposed him and his family.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, he e-mailed the two-megabyte video to a nearby friend, who quickly forwarded it to the Voice of America, the newspaper The Guardian in London and five online friends in Europe, with a message that read, \"Please let the world know.\" It was one of those friends, an Iranian expatriate in the Netherlands, who posted it on Facebook, weeping as he did so, he recalled.</p>\r\n<p>Copies of the video, as well as a shorter one shot by another witness, spread almost instantly to YouTube and were televised within hours by CNN. Despite a prolonged effort by Iran's government to keep a media lid on the violent events unfolding on the streets, Ms. Agha-Soltan was transformed on the Web from a nameless victim into an icon of the Iranian protest movement.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Soltan, Neda Agha"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92c7038f0d807d776200c","word_count":"486"}

It is with deep sadness that The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art has learned of the passing of its beloved honorary member Riva Castleman, who became an honorary member after her retirement from the MoMA staff in 1995. Among her many projects for the Museum's International Program was the comprehensive survey Modern Art in Prints that was exhibited in 23 cities in Australia, New Zealand, India, Iran, and Japan. She also directed other important traveling exhibitions including Latin American Prints, American Prints 1913-1963, and Modern Artists as Illustrators, which had extensive tours in Latin America, the Far East, and Europe. Riva will be long remembered by her many friends and colleagues throughout the world for her unerring eye, her keen intelligence, and her very sharp wit. We send our deepest sympathies to her family.

He is believed to have joined Hezbollah in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and his success in the bombings against U.S. targets, which killed a total of 258 Americans, propelled him into its upper ranks. Since then, his role has been murky and he has lived a life of exceptional secrecy.

Irving Howe once described her as “the archaeologist of human relations,” and she wrote persuasively about politics, feminism, Communism and black-white relations in Africa before moving on to explore the emotional crevices of the human psyche in her groundbreaking 1962 novel, “The Golden Notebook.”</p>\n\n<p>In announcing the award in Stockholm in October 2007, the Swedish Academy called her an “epicist of the female experience, who with skepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny.” The award came with a 10 million Swedish crown honorarium, about $1.6 million.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Lessing, who was 88 when she won the award, is self-educated -- she ran away from home at age 15. Born to British parents in what is now Iran, she was raised in colonial Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and lives in London.</p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\" title=\"More\" id=\"more\">Read More...</a>\n</p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n\n<p>The 11th female Nobel winner in literature, Ms. Lessing has written many works of fiction, as well as nonfiction, an autobiography and plays.  She is still primarily known for “The Golden Notebook,” an early inspiration to feminists. The Swedish Academy said of the book that the burgeoning feminist movement saw it as a pioneering work and it belongs to the handful of books that informed the 20th century view of the male-female relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The novel told the story of  Anna Wulf, a woman who wanted to live freely and was in some ways Ms. Lessing's alter-ego. Because Ms. Lessing frankly depicted female anger and aggression, she was attacked as unfeminine. In response, Ms. Lessing wrote: “Apparently what many women were thinking, feeling, experiencing came as a great surprise.”</p>\n\n<p>But Ms. Lessing also felt that focusing only on feminism obscured the other issues raised by the novel. So she always had harsh comments about the movement, many of whose members idolized her. Speaking in New York in 1970, she said, “I've got the feeling that the sex war is not the most important war going on, nor is it the most vital problem in our lives.”</p>\n\n<p>Fourteen years later, she rebuked another American audience, saying that the women's movement should have tried to work with men. “How can you expect things to change,” she said, “if you're talking to yourself?” In 1994, in a very different world from 1962, she again criticized feminism, saying that “things have changed for white, middle-class women, but nothing has changed outside this group.” Asked about her anti-feminist feelings when her work resounded with the issues that fueled the women's movement, she responded, “It wouldn't be enough to say I'm a woman, after all?”</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Oct. 11, 2007</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\" title=\"Hide\" id=\"more\">Hide</a></p></div> ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Lessing, Doris"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"520a8d3b38f0d8740ac8b4e7","word_count":"475"}
