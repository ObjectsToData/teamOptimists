It is with great sadness that we share the news that Dan Mindich, extraordinary husband and father, beloved son, brother and friend, died of a presumed cardiac event on September 1 while swimming in an open water race near his home in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dan graduated from Vassar College, where he met the love of his life, the amazing Shilpa Patel. After spending a year teaching in rural Kenya, Dan graduated from Stanford's STEP program with a master's in education. He went on to teach in northern California, Vermont and finally at the Punahou School, in Honolulu where he taught English and History. He returned to Stanford to earn a doctorate in educational policy before rejoining the Punahou faculty in 2011 where, in addition to teaching, he served as the director of its Academy Summer School. Dan was a remarkable teacher, known for his humor, energy and ability to inspire excellence in his students. He had a huge heart, which had room for so many people and he was loved by so many. He loved to eat, tell stories and to laugh until he cried. Dan is survived by Shilpa and their three children, Satya, Asha and Vida; his parents, Leonard and Margot Zucker Mindich; his brothers, David and Jeremy; his sister-in law, Amy Smith; the Patel family; his extended family and friends. We need to continue to tell Daniel stories, remember his irrepressible joy, perform random acts of kindness as he did and remember his love and pass it on. A memorial service will be held later in the year. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Punahou School for the Daniel Mindich Endowed Financial Aid Fund. 1601 Punahou Street Honolulu, HI 96822.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  MINDICH, DANIEL B."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-09-15T02:18:31Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5416aa9679881072eb9ef4bf","word_count":"290"}
