He was able to walk out of Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s office to seek medical attention, and underwent emergency surgery on Dec. 11.</p>\n<p>As the senior policy maker on the administration&#8217;s most pressing foreign policy issue, Mr. Holbrooke helped shape the civilian component of the administration&#8217;s Afghanistan strategy, deploying more than 1,000 diplomats and aid workers to help the Afghans rebuild their state institutions.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke was portrayed by some as disruptive and his relationship with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan chilled after difficult meetings following the August 2009 election.</p>\n<p>In one episode that dramatized the building animosities in the Obama administration, Gen. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/james_l_jones/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=james%20l%20jones&amp;st=cse\">James L.

Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to be fired, so that makes him dangerous.'' On another occasion, General McChrystal was described as reacting with exasperation when he received an e-mail message from Mr. Holbrooke. ''Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke. I don't even want to open it.''</p>\n<p>General <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/david_h_petraeus/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=petraeus&amp;st=cse\">David H. Petraeus</a>, who formerly oversaw all military forces in the Middle East and took over as commander in Afghanistan, said Mr. Holbrooke had been his \"wingman\" and that the two had a \"very good relationship.\"</p>\n<p>Officials had said that Mr. Holbrooke's job security was less in doubt than it was in early 2010, when his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he had arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, now manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrooke's most recent portfolio played to his weaknesses, his own allies admitted. He was best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke had become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan government's campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs under President Jimmy Carter, and assistant secretary of state for European affairs and then United States ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton. Early in his career, he served as Peace Corps director in Morocco in 1970, and as editor of Foreign Policy magazine from 1972 to 1976.</p>\n<p>He was passed over for secretary of state in 1996, when Mr. Clinton instead chose Madeleine K. Albright.</p>\n<p>Mr. Holbrooke was well known in the Washington foreign-policy establishment, among journalists and overseas. During the conflict in August 2008 between Russia and Georgia, he was one of the first Americans to fly to Tbilisi to meet with the Georgian leader Mikhail Saakashvili, a friend.</p>\n<p>He was born April 24, 1941, in New York City and graduated from Brown  University in 1962.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Holbrooke, Richard C."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92d6d38f0d807d7762380","word_count":"711"}

Whether dropped from aircraft or fired from artillery, cluster bombs can scatter dozens or even hundreds of smaller explosives across an area the size of a football field.</p>\n\n<p> Some bomblets fail to explode upon hitting the ground and, like landmines, can remain a deadly hazard to children, farmers and other civilians long after a conflict ends. Campaigners say cluster bombs should follow mustard gas and dum-dum bullets, high-velocity ammunition that often breaks apart upon impact, into a closed chapter of the history of warfare.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2008, dozens of nations in Oslo signed a treaty banning cluster bombs. Non-signers included some of the world's biggest military powers, among them  the United States, Russian and China.   Many of the signatories expressed concern that the treaty  fails to bind the countries most prone to military conflict. </p>\n\n<p>Washington, Moscow and other non-signers, including  India, Pakistan and most Middle Eastern states,  say cluster bombs have legitimate military uses such as repelling advancing troop columns. But according to the group Handicap International, 98 percent of cluster-bomb victims are civilians, and 27 percent are children.</p>\n\n<p>American officials defended their stance, saying that the United States has been developing advanced cluster munitions that were less likely to harm civilians and has provided nearly half of all global funding for the clearance of unexploded ordnance.</p>\n<p>Norway, which began the drive to ban cluster bombs 18 months ago, was the first to sign, followed by Laos and Lebanon, both hard-hit by the weapons. Britain, formerly a major stockpiler of cluster munitions, also signed the treaty. The treaty’s unequivocal language is meant to be so strong that even countries refusing to sign it will be reluctant to deploy the weapons or trade  them in commercially.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the many signatures gathered in Oslo, most countries will still require some legislative process to ratify the treaty. </p>\n<p>The convention will not enter into force until six months after the 30th nation has officially ratified it — a milestone that Norwegian organizers said could be achieved by 2009. </p>\n<p>Cluster bombs can cause casualties long after the conflict in which they were deployed is over. In Laos, unexploded cluster munitions are a legacy of United States bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail during the Vietnam War. Old Russian-made bomblets still inflict casualties in Afghanistan and Chechnya. \nOne of the last confirmed uses of cluster bombs was in 2006, when Israel fired large numbers of them into southern Lebanon during a monthlong conflict with the militant group Hezbollah. Afterward, United Nations peacekeepers reported unexploded munitions strewn across the landscape. Accidental detonations have killed or maimed hundreds of civilians since then, human rights workers said. Human rights groups have also alleged that Georgia and Russia used cluster munitions extensively in their war in August, although both countries have challenged this.</p>\n\n<p>A NATO policy banning the use of cluster munitions in Afghanistan has been in place since 2007. Human Rights Watch estimates that hundreds of civilian casualties in the early stages of the Afghanistan War in 2001 were caused by cluster bombs dropped by the American Air Force. </p>\n\n<p>The lessons of Afghanistan led to a change by the Air Force, and in the Iraq invasion in 2003 there were very few civilians killed by air-dropped clusters, though hundreds of Iraqi civilians were killed in Iraq in 2003 by Army rocket clusters. According to Human Rights Watch, American forces have not used any cluster bombs since 2003.</p>\n","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cluster Munitions"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"520d2f6338f0d8740ac8bc58","word_count":"588"}

Adam M. Holcomb, who was found guilty of maltreatment and assault. The jury, however, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/nyregion/army-jury-acquits-sergeant-of-driving-pvt-danny-chen-to-suicide-in-afghanistan.html\">acquitted him</a> of the most serious charges.</p>\n<p>Sergeant Holcomb was sentenced to 30 days in prison, demoted a rank and forced to forfeit one month&#8217;s pay.

Adam M. Holcomb revolved around what caused Private Chen to take his own life.</p>\n<p>Military prosecutors asserted that Private Chen&#8217;s motivations for killing himself took shape after his arrival in Afghanistan in August 2011. Sergeant Holcomb, they said, made Private Chen miserable by subjecting him to racial harassment and hazing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the last six weeks of Danny&#8217;s life,&#8221; Maj. Steve Berlin, one of the prosecutors, told the jury during closing arguments. &#8220;No wonder death seemed like the only option.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sergeant Holcomb&#8217;s lawyers, however, contended that Private Chen was despondent because of his failures as a soldier and because he had a fraught relationship with his parents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Private Chen killed Private Chen,&#8221; said Capt. Anthony Osborne, one of Sergeant Holcomb&#8217;s lawyers, during closing arguments.</p>\n<p>Defense lawyers said Private Chen&#8217;s personal troubles were evident before he went to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Pvt. Bryan Johnson, a soldier in Private Chen&#8217;s unit who became a close friend, testified that Private Chen was excited to deploy. But he also described an incident in which he found him curled up in the fetal position on his bunk.</p>\n<p>Private Chen told his friend that his parents had disowned him because he was about to deploy to Afghanistan. Defense lawyers said Private Chen told at least four other soldiers the same thing.</p>\n<p>Though Private Johnson said his friend had rebounded by the next day, defense lawyers argued that this episode revealed that Private Chen&#8217;s relationship with his parents was undermining his duties.</p>\n<p>Private Chen&#8217;s parents testified at the trial that they had never disowned him.</p>\n<p>In Afghanistan, Private Chen was &#8220;ostracized,&#8221; said the prosecutor, Major Berlin.</p>\n<p>He was so weak and inexperienced that he was not allowed to go out on patrol, fellow soldiers testified.</p>\n<p>He also made frequent mistakes, soldiers said, and was repeatedly subjected to &#8220;corrective training.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prosecutors argued, however, that Private Chen&#8217;s inexperience was normal for someone new and that the problem lay with the way superiors were addressing his deficiencies.</p>\n<p>In a pivotal incident several days before Private Chen&#8217;s death, Sergeant Holcomb, angry with him, yanked him from his bunk and dragged him across the outpost, soldiers testified. Private Chen&#8217;s offense was leaving the shower&#8217;s water pump on. The assault count and one count of maltreatment related to the dragging incident. The other maltreatment count related to Sergeant Holcomb&#8217;s use of racially disparaging terms.</p>\n<p>Several days before his death, Private Chen <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/nyregion/pvt-danny-chen-talked-of-suicide-over-hazing-friend-testifies.html\">told a fellow soldier</a> that he was so fed up with the treatment he was receiving at the hands of Sergeant Holcomb and other superiors, he was contemplating suicide, according to testimony.</p>\n<p>On Oct. 3, 2011, he shot himself while on guard duty in a tower.</p>\n<p>According to the doctor who performed the autopsy, a message was scrawled in black on his forearm: &#8220;Tell my parents I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Chen, Danny"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"527ac88b38f0d866066342c7","word_count":"1023"}

He was accused of being behind the <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/world/asia/28pakistan.html\">assassination</a> of <a title=\"More articles about Benazir Bhutto.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/benazir_bhutto/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Benazir Bhutto</a>, the former Pakistani prime minister, in a suicide bombing in December 2007, among scores of other attacks.

In fact, the August missile strike took place as Mr. Mehsud, a diabetic, was on a drip infusion for his kidney ailment, according to two Taliban fighters.</p>\n<p>Pakistani officials announced on Aug. 18 that Mr. Mehsud's death had been confirmed by the Pakistani Taliban spokesman, Maulvi Said Muhammad, who also goes by the name Maulvi Omar, after he was captured by local tribesmen in a Taliban stronghold in western Pakistan and turned over to security forces. &#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>Mr. Mehsud's apparent death set off a power struggle over control of the Pakistani Taliban, leading to the shooting death of the No. 2 figure in the militant group, Hakimullah Mehsud, several days later.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, Baitullah Mehsud was a Pashtun tribesman who did not register on the radar screen of intelligence services or the Pakistani government. But he became perhaps the most prominent example of a tribal Taliban fighter who at first fought in Afghanistan and cooperated with the Pakistani Army, but then turned against his own country, unleashing a vicious campaign of violence in the name of spreading the rule of Islam.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"More\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('moretxt'); javascript:toggleLayer2('more');\">Read More...</a></p>\n<div id=\"moretxt\">\n<p>His turn against the Pakistan state, intelligence analysts say, was seen as a direct result of his close alliance with Al Qaeda, in particular with <a title=\"More articles about Ayman Al-Zawahiri.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/ayman_al_zawahiri/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Ayman al-Zawahri</a>, the second in command, as well as the powerful Afghan Taliban leader, <a title=\"More articles about Sirajuddin Haqqani.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/sirajuddin_haqqani/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Sirajuddin Haqqani</a>, who also has a close working connection to Al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mehsud was once a minor figure in the small Shabi Khel branch of the Mehsud tribe in South Waziristan, an inhospitable mountainous territory that fiercely resisted efforts by the armies of the British  empire to conquer it. The son of a prayer leader, he had a basic religious education where he grew up in Miram Shah, the capital of North Waziristan. It was probably there that he was first recruited to fight in Afghanistan alongside the Taliban during their period in government in the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>He served with the Taliban at the Kabul airport, according to a senior Afghan security official. After the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, he returned to his native Waziristan, accompanied by thousands of Afghan Taliban and hundreds of foreign Qaeda fighters who settled in North and South Waziristan.</p>\n<p>As the Pakistani Army began operations in Waziristan in 2004, Mr. Mehsud was promoted by the Taliban leadership to command the fighters from the Mehsud tribe.</p>\n<p>But Pakistani officials still considered him someone they could deal with, and in February 2005 they signed a much-criticized peace deal under which the army pulled back its forces, giving Mr. Mehsud freedom to operate in South Waziristan.</p>\n<p>He quickly expanded his forces and power, and by December 2007 he had been named the leader of the Tehrik-e-Taliban, the umbrella movement that commands most of the Taliban groups throughout Pakistan's tribal areas and the adjoining Swat  Valley.</p>\n<p>His growth had brought Mr. Mehsud back into confrontation with the Pakistani military. In 2007, he took about 250 Pakistani Army soldiers hostage when they tried to pass through his tribal territory.</p>\n<p>The hostage-taking came just days after the government laid <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/world/asia/10pakistan.htm\">siege</a> to militants in the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July 2007, and was apparently in retaliation for the government's crackdown.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mehsud began attacking Pakistani military and intelligence targets in the tribal areas and beyond, and was behind almost all of the scores of suicide bombings that have occurred in Pakistan's cities since then, according to Gen. <a title=\"More articles about Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/ashfaq_parvez_kayani/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Ashfaq Parvez Kayani</a>, the commander of the Pakistani Army.</p>\n<p>Afghan security officials said that Mr. Mehsud had also sent suicide bombers to Afghanistan and to Iraq since 2006, as the number of suicide bombings soared in those countries.</p>\n<p>He hosted many foreign fighters in his territory, including Uzbeks and others from Central Asia, and he ran training camps to indoctrinate suicide bombers, weapons he once called his own atom bombs. Working closely with him in training suicide bombers were two Pakistani militants, named Qari Zafar and Qari Hussain.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mehsud also ran private jails and held dozens of kidnapped hostages, trading them for money or for his own fighters caught by the Pakistani authorities.</p>\n<p>He had survived two large-scale operations against his fighters by the Pakistani military, one in January 2008 and another in June 2009.</p>\n<p>Both times the Pakistani military seemed to pull back before finishing off Mr. Mehsud and his forces, prompting suspicions that he was still regarded as an asset by the military establishment, which has long supported militant groups to fight proxy wars in Kashmir and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>But his attacks inside Pakistan escalated with complex attacks on government buildings and five-star hotels, which were seen as a threat to the nation.</p>\n<p>In June 2009, a Pakistani government official confirmed that a military offensive was planned in South Waziristan, where Mr. Mehsud was based.</p>\n<a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more');%20javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Mehsud, Baitullah"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"51f92e2238f0d807d77625d8","word_count":"1071"}

Some felt that economic rigor had gone too far, and that the government should renege on its promises to European allies and the markets to get the budget deficit this year to 3 percent of gross domestic product.</p>\n<p>Others said that Mr. Hollande&#8217;s decision to meet the target by raising taxes and freezing spending, rather than cutting it, would throw France into recession, even as growth, so far elusive, would by itself provide more tax receipts and jobs.</p>\n<p>The president was also questioned about his leadership. Mr. Hollande has tried to contrast his style with that of his predecessor, the hyperkinetic Nicolas Sarkozy, but the French, never happy, complain that Mr. Hollande seems somnolent in the face of the economic crisis.</p>\n<p>Then there were the opinion polls, which&#160;<a title=\"French Socialists, Under Fire, Display a Lack of Fraternit&#233;\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/world/europe/for-frances-socialists-a-breakdown-in-fraternite.html\">showed high dissatisfaction with Mr. Hollande</a>. About 64 percent of the French said they were unhappy with his government, and only 10 percent believed the situation in France had improved since he took office, according to an <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/assets/pdf/opinionway-le-figaro-bilan-hollande-251012.pdf\">OpinionWay poll in October 2012</a> for Le Figaro.</p>\n<p>Sixty-nine percent of those polled said they were unhappy with the failure to reduce unemployment, which was at a 13-year high, and 66 percent were unhappy with fiscal policy. Sixty-eight percent said they thought Mr. Hollande did not know how to show authority, and 63 percent said he could not make difficult decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Until May 2011, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/dominique_strausskahn/index.html?8qa\">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a>, the former head of the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?8qa\">International Monetary Fund</a>, was considered the obvious choice atop the Socialist ticket, until he was accused (the charges were dropped) of raping a maid in a New York hotel room. Only after Mr. Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s downfall did Mr. Hollande &#8212; who has never held a ministerial portfolio and who, from 1997 to 2008, presided over a badly bruised Socialist Party &#8212; look like a truly viable candidate.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s still an extremely unlikely one, especially during this time of economic crisis, of anxiety about Islam and immigration and of confusion about France&#8217;s reduced role in the world. One reason for his success, surely, is that the French have grown tired of Mr. Sarkozy &#8212; his crass friends and his adolescent behavior. But it&#8217;s also that Mr. Hollande provides <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/magazine/the-soft-middle-of-francois-hollande.html?pagewanted=print\">a quainter and, for many, more comfortable vision of what a French politician should be.</a> Mr. Hollande has tried to wrap himself in the spirit of the previous Socialist president, Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand, who left office in 1995.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande prepared himself for power in the most typically French way possible, graduating from the country&#8217;s finest schools, or les grandes &#233;coles. The French elite is formed in these institutions more narrowly than America&#8217;s ruling class is formed in the Ivy League, and its members remain close, whether they favor the left or the right. Mr. Hollande&#8217;s class at L&#8217;&#201;cole Nationale d&#8217;Administration included Jean-Maurice Ripert, a senior diplomat; Dominique de Villepin, a former foreign minister; the chairman of a major insurance company; the head of the French stock market; numerous former ministers; and S&#233;gol&#232;ne Royal, Mr. Hollande&#8217;s former partner, mother of his four children and losing Socialist candidate in 2007. His class did not include Mr. Sarkozy, who failed to work his way through les grandes &#233;coles and is said to resent their graduates even now.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande says he is a &#8220;normal man,&#8221; a description mocked by Mr. Sarkozy, an immigrant&#8217;s son who is hardly normal by French standards. Mr. Sarkozy speaks bluntly,&#160; pushed for tax cuts for the rich and for corporations and is viewed as slightly &#8220;American&#8221; in his politics and his manner. By contrast, Mr. Hollande wears his indignations proudly, as a mark of earned strength. &#8220;To be elected, it&#8217;s necessary to have been beaten; to be loved, it&#8217;s necessary to have suffered,&#8221; he once said. &#8220;The scars, the blows, the fact that nothing has been given to you &#8212; people appreciate it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande used to be referred to as &#8220;Flanby,&#8221; after a brand of wobbly caramel pudding, just one of a string of insulting nicknames for a convivial man considered always at the second rank of politics. He has been called &#8220;a living marshmallow&#8221; and &#8220;Mr. Little Jokes,&#8221; and Martine Aubry, the head of the Socialist Party, described him as a couille molle, a nasty way of saying he has no guts.&#160;A name that stuck for a long time is &#8220;Mr. Royal,&#8217;' a reference to Ms. Royal, Mr. Holland&#8217;s former partner.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande broke from his father&#8217;s far-right politics, but he never presented himself as much of a rebel. His big youthful adventure consisted of traveling through Europe with his friends in an old Peugeot J7, a French version of the VW bus, while listening to the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. And in 1974, he got a travel grant from business school to go to the United States for the summer, studying the supreme American invention of fast food &#8212; particularly McDonald&#8217;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which hadn&#8217;t yet established themselves in France. He drove from New York to San Francisco in what he remembered as &#8220;a very difficult period for the United States.&#8221; &#8220;Nixon was being pursued,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the dollar was very low, there was a doubt about America, the exit from Vietnam, but I saw the potential.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He wrote a report saying that fast food would come to France. &#8220;I could have made a fortune in cheeseburgers, but I finally chose politics,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>In Dealing With Germany, the Issue of Sovereignty</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/world/europe/france-and-germany-face-delicate-talks-on-economy.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hpw\">France has always wanted what Charles de Gaulle called &#8220;L&#8217;Europe des patries,&#8221;</a> or the Europe of homelands or nations, which keeps important decisions firmly in the hands of national leaders. And so Mr. Hollande&#8217;s negotiations with Mrs. Merkel over the euro crisis have been politically fraught.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande is arguing for collectivized debt, or so-called euro bonds, and for the European Central Bank to be able to loan directly to banks and to the European bailout funds. He wants the bank to operate more like the United States Federal Reserve, able to act as a lender of last resort to guarantee the debts of euro zone countries.</p>\n<p>In response, Ms. Merkel contends that these steps must be a result of a closer political and economic union, not a precursor to it. Shared debt can work only if there is shared decision-making over budgets, taxes and pensions, she says. That is why she is pushing to move ahead with the long-stalled process of European integration.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;more Europe&#8221; would mean a considerable loss of French sovereignty over its national budget and the French financial system, an extraordinarily delicate issue for Mr. Hollande and his Socialist Party, which split badly on a similar issue in 2005.</p>\n<p>Any moves toward a deeper union within Europe would require constitutional change. And because Mr. Hollande does not have the necessary three-fifths majority in Parliament, he would face a demand for a public referendum.</p>\n<p><strong>A Meeting With Obama Before G-8 and NATO Summit</strong></p>\n<p>On May 18, Mr. Hollande met with <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">President Obama</a> and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the White House. It was the administration&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/world/afghan-security-iran-syria-on-agenda-between-g8-leaders-ahead-of-nato-summit.html?ref=world\">first official face-to-face interaction with the new French leader</a>, who wants a more stimulative economic policy and a lesser role in <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\">Afghanistan</a> than did his predecessor.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande is one of the leaders of the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/group_of_eight/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Group of 8</a> industrial nations, who are meeting on May 18-19 at Camp David in Maryland, in advance of the NATO meeting in Chicago on May 20-21.</p>\n<p>After the session at the White House, where the leaders said they discussed Europe&#8217;s economy, Afghanistan, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\">Iran</a> and <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo\">Syria</a>, Mrs. Clinton hosted Mr. Hollande at a working lunch at Blair House. Later, she met with her new French counterpart, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.</p>\n<p>There is no reason to expect tensions with the Hollande government; on the economic front, the White House is not unfriendly to economic stimulus, and the differences over how quickly to withdraw from Afghanistan are not profound.</p>\n<p>In brief remarks to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Hollande said that he was committed to providing assistance to Afghan security, and that that would be discussed at the NATO summit meeting. Mr. Hollande said during his election campaign that he preferred French forces to leave Afghanistan before the timetable agreed to by NATO.</p>\n<p><strong>A Plan for Higher Taxes on &#8216;Les Riches&#8217;&#160;</strong></p>\n<p>In summer 2012, a chill wafted over France&#8217;s business class as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/business/global/frances-les-riches-vow-to-leave-if-75-tax-rate-is-passed.html\">Mr. Hollande vowed to&#160;impose a 75 percent tax on the portion of anyone&#8217;s income above a million euros ($1.24 million) a year</a>.</p>\n<p>The 75 percent tax proposal, which Parliament plans to take up in September, is ostensibly aimed at bolstering French finances as Europe&#8217;s long-running <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">debt crisis</a> intensifies.</p>\n<p>But because there are relatively few people in France whose income would incur such a tax &#8212; an estimated 7,000 to 30,000 in a country of 65 million &#8212; the gains might contribute but a small fraction of the 33 billion euros in new revenue the government wants to raise in 2013 to help balance the budget.</p>\n<p>The French finance ministry did not respond to requests for an estimate of the revenue the tax might raise. Though the amount would be low, some analysts note that a tax hit on the rich would provide political cover for painful cuts Mr. Hollande may need to make in social and welfare programs that are likely to be far less popular with the rank and file.</p>\n<p><strong>A &#8216;Normal Man&#8217; With a Complicated Private Life</strong></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2012, the two women in Mr. Hollande&#8217;s life &#8212; his current partner, Val&#233;rie Trierweiler, a journalist, and his former partner, S&#233;gol&#232;ne Royal, a Socialist politician the mother of his four children &#8212; found themselves at the center of a wave of coverage that started with a Twitter message.</p>\n<p>During the legislative campaign in the spring, Ms. Trierweiler, 47, angered at Mr. Hollande&#8217;s public support for Ms. Royal, sent a message effectively endorsing Ms. Royal&#8217;s opponent. This was doubly embarrassing because Ms. Royal, 58, was the official candidate of the Socialist Party and of Mr. Hollande, also 58. Ms. Royal ended up losing badly, so there was humiliation all around.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollande&#8217;s amorous life, and his decision to leave Ms. Royal for the younger Ms. Trierweiler, was already well ventilated during his successful presidential campaign. But he is facing a potentially more serious political issue: The apparent intense rivalry between the women &#8212; with Ms. Trierweiler aggressively defending her new position as first partner &#8212; may have a slowly degrading effect on his self-styled image as a &#8220;normal man&#8221; who is now a &#8220;normal president.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Until recently, Ms. Trierweiler was seen as an elegant and strong-willed woman who continued to work as a journalist while supporting her partner. She negotiated a deal with Paris Match to contribute book and art reviews and other cultural coverage a few times a month.</p>\n<p>The anti-Royal tweet in June changed that perception, and Mr. Hollande made a point, in a television interview on July 14 &#8212; Bastille Day &#8212; of stating that he had told those close to him to keep their private lives private and to resolve their conflicts away from the news media. At the same time, Mr. Hollande&#8217;s oldest son, Thomas, told friends that the children would now keep their distance from Ms. Trierweiler.</p>\n<p class=\"showhidetxt\"><a id=\"more\" title=\"Hide\" href=\"javascript:toggleLayer('more'); javascript:toggleLayer2('moretxt');\">Hide</a></p>\n</div>","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Hollande, François"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":null,"document_type":"topic","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Times Topics","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"timestopic","_id":"527ac89e38f0d866066342e5","word_count":"2344"}
