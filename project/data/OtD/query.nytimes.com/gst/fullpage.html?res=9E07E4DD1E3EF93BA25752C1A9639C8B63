 $(6$)TISCH--Preston Robert. The Tufts community is deeply saddened by the loss of Preston Robert Tisch. Bob Tisch was an extraordinary leader, a wonderful human being, and a generous friend. He exemplified everything we at Tufts hope that our students will become. He was an imaginative and creative businessman, a generous philanthropist, and a true public citizen. Most of all, Bob Tisch was a people person, downto-earth, quick witted and able to connect with people from all walks of life. Bob was also a risk taker. He placed a big bet on a small New England university many years ago, well before others recognized our potential. Tufts University is the distinguished institution it is today in part because of the confidence that Bob Tisch placed in us, and that inspired so many others to follow his lead. Bob Tisch touched many lives in his own lifetime, across the arts, education, civic organizations, and human service initiatives. We at Tufts are grateful for the opportunity to have known this extraordinary man. We extend heartfelt condolences to Joan, his wife, his son Jonathan, an alumnus, trustee, and overseer of Tufts, his son Steven, an alumnus of Tufts, his daughter Laurie, and the entire Tisch family. James A. Stern, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Tufts University Lawrence S. Bacow, President, Tufts University

 $(6$)TISCH--Preston Robert. The Tufts community is deeply saddened by the loss of Preston Robert Tisch. Bob Tisch was an extraordinary leader, a wonderful human being, and a generous friend. He exemplified everything we at Tufts hope that our students will become. He was an imaginative and creative businessman, a generous philanthropist, and a true public citizen. Most of all, Bob Tisch was a people person, downto-earth, quick witted and able to connect with people from all walks of life. Bob was also a risk taker. He placed a big bet on a small New England university many years ago, well before others recognized our potential. Tufts University is the distinguished institution it is today in part because of the confidence that Bob Tisch placed in us, and that inspired so many others to follow his lead. Bob Tisch touched many lives in his own lifetime, across the arts, education, civic organizations, and human service initiatives. We at Tufts are grateful for the opportunity to have known this extraordinary man. We extend heartfelt condolences to Joan, his wife, his son Jonathan, an alumnus, trustee, and overseer of Tufts, his son Steven, an alumnus of Tufts, his daughter Laurie, and the entire Tisch family. James A. Stern, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Tufts University Lawrence S. Bacow, President, Tufts University

He was the essence of everything that is the very best of New York, and this City will never be the same without him. A giant of a man, his philanthropy is legend, his importance within the business community needs no mention.

He once said, ''I want to be everyone's friend''--and he was. Blanche Sprague

His decency, wit, friendship and common humanity were extraordinary. For us Bob was our most valued, trusted and loved friend. He was larger than life and for over forty years his friendship and family involvement were integral to our lives. He was a mainstay to us, our children and all of his close friends. He was always available to listen, to help, to offer guidance or just ''take care of it.'' Family occasions will not be the same anymore. Bob was fortunate to be surrounded by a large and devoted family who adored him. His friends felt the same way. Our deepest sympathy to Joan and the entire Tisch family. Linda and Sandy

He was the essence of everything that is the very best of New York, and this City will never be the same without him. A giant of a man, his philanthropy is legend, his importance within the business community needs no mention.

He once said, ''I want to be everyone's friend''--and he was. Blanche Sprague
