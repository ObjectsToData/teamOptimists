&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Royal Opera in London has abruptly stopped its longtime use of black skin makeup, saying it wanted to be ''sensitive to issues of racism,'' The Observer newspaper reported. The company, in Covent Garden, made a last-minute change in its plan for Verdi's opera ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' with the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe in the role of Ulrica, a fortune teller. She had been ''blacked up,'' as it is known, for rehearsals, but when the opera opened on Thursday her skin was its natural white color. In its decision the company overruled the director, the Italian filmmaker Mario Martone, who was informed just hours before the curtain went up. His production of ''Un Ballo'' opened at Covent Garden earlier this year with another singer in black makeup. ''Blacking up'' has long been banished from theater and television in Britain but has remained common in opera, The Observer reported; last summer, controversy surrounded a production of Verdi's ''Otello'' at the Glyndebourne festival.

&lt;br&gt;War Protester's Book
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Cindy Sheehan, the California woman who drew wide news media attention for her 26-day protest camp last summer near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., has written a book that will be published tomorrow. ''Not One More Mother's Child,'' issued by a new publisher, Koa Books of Hawaii, contains journal entries, speeches, letters and new writings, The Associated Press reported. Koa has printed 20,000 copies so far and paid Ms. Sheehan a ''modest'' advance; she said she had accepted the company's offer because she didn't care about the money and wanted the book printed quickly. Ms. Sheehan's son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, was killed in Iraq in April 2004.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;On Broadway
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Phylicia Rashad will play the title role in a new musical by Michael John LaChiusa at the Lincoln Center Theater. ''Bernarda Alba,'' an adaptation of the Federico García Lorca play ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' about a newly widowed mother's struggle with her daughters, is to begin previews on Feb. 11 and open on March 6. Gracile Daniele will direct and choreograph, and the show will also feature Nikki M. James, Sally Murphy, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Saundra Santiago as the daughters. Ms. Rashad won a Tony Award for ''A Raisin in the Sun'' last year.  Jonathan Pryce will return to Broadway for the first time in nearly 15 years to replace John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson, the con man in ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' He will start on Jan. 17. Mr. Pryce has won two Tonys, for ''Miss Saigon'' in 1991 and ''Comedians,'' his Broadway debut, in 1977. The show is at the Imperial Theater on West 45th Street.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Baltimore Museum to Grow
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where space has already become cramped since a renovation was completed four years ago, has signed a contract to purchase a nearby building from the Maryland Historical Society. The three-story, 36,000-square-foot building, on Centre Street a block west of the Walters, now houses the Contemporary Museum, offices of the Maryland Humanities Council and storage for the historical society. It is to be bought for $1.5 million, which was contributed from a museum donor, and the sale is to be closed by the end of the year.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Casting Call
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  David Bowie, below, is in talks to play the inventor Nikola Tesla in a new thriller from Christopher Nolan, who directed ''Batman Begins'' and ''Memento,'' according to The Hollywood Reporter. The film, ''The Prestige,'' based on the 1995 novel of that name by Christopher Priest, is a tale of rival magicians in early 20th-century London; the Tesla character is based on the real-life Serbian-American scientist who discovered the rotating magnetic field. The cast already includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and shooting is scheduled to begin in January.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Musical Chairs
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The conductor of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Ali Rabari, quit the orchestra and left Tehran for Vienna on Saturday, according to the Mehr news agency of Iran. He said he would not return unless all the musicians of the Tehran orchestra gain their rights and get appropriate salaries. ''I cannot bear this situation when I see a good musician of this group gets paid 800,000 rials a month,'' he told a crowd at a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Tehran on Friday, citing a figure worth about $90.  Frank Madlener has been named the next director of Ircam, the contemporary-music research organization based at the Pompidou Center in Paris, Le Monde reported. He was appointed by the French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres. Mr. Madlener, 36, who has been a director of Musica in Strasbourg, France, and other contemporary-music festivals, will take over from Jean-Michel Lejeune in January.">

<br>
<p>
  The Royal Opera in London has abruptly stopped its longtime use of black skin makeup, saying it wanted to be ''sensitive to issues of racism,'' The Observer newspaper reported. The company, in Covent Garden, made a last-minute change in its plan for Verdi's opera ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' with the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe in the role of Ulrica, a fortune teller. She had been ''blacked up,'' as it is known, for rehearsals, but when the opera opened on Thursday her skin was its natural white color. In its decision the company overruled the director, the Italian filmmaker Mario Martone, who was informed just hours before the curtain went up. His production of ''Un Ballo'' opened at Covent Garden earlier this year with another singer in black makeup. ''Blacking up'' has long been banished from theater and television in Britain but has remained common in opera, The Observer reported; last summer, controversy surrounded a production of Verdi's ''Otello'' at the Glyndebourne festival.

<br>War Protester's Book
<br>
<p>
  Cindy Sheehan, the California woman who drew wide news media attention for her 26-day protest camp last summer near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., has written a book that will be published tomorrow. ''Not One More Mother's Child,'' issued by a new publisher, Koa Books of Hawaii, contains journal entries, speeches, letters and new writings, The Associated Press reported. Koa has printed 20,000 copies so far and paid Ms. Sheehan a ''modest'' advance; she said she had accepted the company's offer because she didn't care about the money and wanted the book printed quickly. Ms. Sheehan's son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, was killed in Iraq in April 2004.
<br>
<br>On Broadway
<br>
<p>
  Phylicia Rashad will play the title role in a new musical by Michael John LaChiusa at the Lincoln Center Theater. ''Bernarda Alba,'' an adaptation of the Federico García Lorca play ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' about a newly widowed mother's struggle with her daughters, is to begin previews on Feb. 11 and open on March 6. Gracile Daniele will direct and choreograph, and the show will also feature Nikki M. James, Sally Murphy, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Saundra Santiago as the daughters. Ms. Rashad won a Tony Award for ''A Raisin in the Sun'' last year.  Jonathan Pryce will return to Broadway for the first time in nearly 15 years to replace John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson, the con man in ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' He will start on Jan. 17. Mr. Pryce has won two Tonys, for ''Miss Saigon'' in 1991 and ''Comedians,'' his Broadway debut, in 1977. The show is at the Imperial Theater on West 45th Street.

<br>Baltimore Museum to Grow
<br>
<p>
  The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where space has already become cramped since a renovation was completed four years ago, has signed a contract to purchase a nearby building from the Maryland Historical Society. The three-story, 36,000-square-foot building, on Centre Street a block west of the Walters, now houses the Contemporary Museum, offices of the Maryland Humanities Council and storage for the historical society. It is to be bought for $1.5 million, which was contributed from a museum donor, and the sale is to be closed by the end of the year.
<br>
<br>Casting Call
<br>
<p>
  David Bowie, below, is in talks to play the inventor Nikola Tesla in a new thriller from Christopher Nolan, who directed ''Batman Begins'' and ''Memento,'' according to The Hollywood Reporter. The film, ''The Prestige,'' based on the 1995 novel of that name by Christopher Priest, is a tale of rival magicians in early 20th-century London; the Tesla character is based on the real-life Serbian-American scientist who discovered the rotating magnetic field. The cast already includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and shooting is scheduled to begin in January.

<br>Musical Chairs
<br>
<p>
  The conductor of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Ali Rabari, quit the orchestra and left Tehran for Vienna on Saturday, according to the Mehr news agency of Iran. He said he would not return unless all the musicians of the Tehran orchestra gain their rights and get appropriate salaries. ''I cannot bear this situation when I see a good musician of this group gets paid 800,000 rials a month,'' he told a crowd at a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Tehran on Friday, citing a figure worth about $90.  Frank Madlener has been named the next director of Ircam, the contemporary-music research organization based at the Pompidou Center in Paris, Le Monde reported. He was appointed by the French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres. Mr. Madlener, 36, who has been a director of Musica in Strasbourg, France, and other contemporary-music festivals, will take over from Jean-Michel Lejeune in January."></div>

<br>
<p>
  The Royal Opera in London has abruptly stopped its longtime use of black skin makeup, saying it wanted to be ''sensitive to issues of racism,'' The Observer newspaper reported. The company, in Covent Garden, made a last-minute change in its plan for Verdi's opera ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' with the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe in the role of Ulrica, a fortune teller. She had been ''blacked up,'' as it is known, for rehearsals, but when the opera opened on Thursday her skin was its natural white color. In its decision the company overruled the director, the Italian filmmaker Mario Martone, who was informed just hours before the curtain went up. His production of ''Un Ballo'' opened at Covent Garden earlier this year with another singer in black makeup. ''Blacking up'' has long been banished from theater and television in Britain but has remained common in opera, The Observer reported; last summer, controversy surrounded a production of Verdi's ''Otello'' at the Glyndebourne festival.

<br>War Protester's Book
<br>
<p>
  Cindy Sheehan, the California woman who drew wide news media attention for her 26-day protest camp last summer near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., has written a book that will be published tomorrow. ''Not One More Mother's Child,'' issued by a new publisher, Koa Books of Hawaii, contains journal entries, speeches, letters and new writings, The Associated Press reported. Koa has printed 20,000 copies so far and paid Ms. Sheehan a ''modest'' advance; she said she had accepted the company's offer because she didn't care about the money and wanted the book printed quickly. Ms. Sheehan's son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, was killed in Iraq in April 2004.

<br>On Broadway
<br>
<p>
  Phylicia Rashad will play the title role in a new musical by Michael John LaChiusa at the Lincoln Center Theater. ''Bernarda Alba,'' an adaptation of the Federico García Lorca play ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' about a newly widowed mother's struggle with her daughters, is to begin previews on Feb. 11 and open on March 6. Gracile Daniele will direct and choreograph, and the show will also feature Nikki M. James, Sally Murphy, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Saundra Santiago as the daughters. Ms. Rashad won a Tony Award for ''A Raisin in the Sun'' last year.  Jonathan Pryce will return to Broadway for the first time in nearly 15 years to replace John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson, the con man in ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' He will start on Jan. 17. Mr. Pryce has won two Tonys, for ''Miss Saigon'' in 1991 and ''Comedians,'' his Broadway debut, in 1977. The show is at the Imperial Theater on West 45th Street.

<br>Baltimore Museum to Grow
<br>
<p>
  The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where space has already become cramped since a renovation was completed four years ago, has signed a contract to purchase a nearby building from the Maryland Historical Society. The three-story, 36,000-square-foot building, on Centre Street a block west of the Walters, now houses the Contemporary Museum, offices of the Maryland Humanities Council and storage for the historical society. It is to be bought for $1.5 million, which was contributed from a museum donor, and the sale is to be closed by the end of the year.

<br>Casting Call
<br>
<p>
  David Bowie, below, is in talks to play the inventor Nikola Tesla in a new thriller from Christopher Nolan, who directed ''Batman Begins'' and ''Memento,'' according to The Hollywood Reporter. The film, ''The Prestige,'' based on the 1995 novel of that name by Christopher Priest, is a tale of rival magicians in early 20th-century London; the Tesla character is based on the real-life Serbian-American scientist who discovered the rotating magnetic field. The cast already includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and shooting is scheduled to begin in January.

<br>Musical Chairs
<br>
<p>
  The conductor of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Ali Rabari, quit the orchestra and left Tehran for Vienna on Saturday, according to the Mehr news agency of Iran. He said he would not return unless all the musicians of the Tehran orchestra gain their rights and get appropriate salaries. ''I cannot bear this situation when I see a good musician of this group gets paid 800,000 rials a month,'' he told a crowd at a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Tehran on Friday, citing a figure worth about $90.  Frank Madlener has been named the next director of Ircam, the contemporary-music research organization based at the Pompidou Center in Paris, Le Monde reported. He was appointed by the French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres. Mr. Madlener, 36, who has been a director of Musica in Strasbourg, France, and other contemporary-music festivals, will take over from Jean-Michel Lejeune in January."></div>
