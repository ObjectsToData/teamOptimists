<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Too bad, it was a cloudy day.  You really can’t see any shadows.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My friend, the inventor Dennis Purcell, corrected me: “I don’t think it was cloudy.  It was a bright, sunny day.  Or perhaps cloudy-bright.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dennis explained that most 19th century photographic emulsions are blue-sensitive and hence cannot record the sky – overcast, partially cloudy and sunny skies are all overexposed.  The sky is a featureless white, but the “whiteness” of the sky is unrelated to the question of whether there are clouds or whether you can see shadows.  It was only much later that panchromatic film was developed.  (This accounts for what I would call The Wisconsin Death-Trip Effect, after the book by the same name.  Scandinavian immigrants in turn-of-the-century Wisconsin might not be insane, but they look insane because their blue eyes are white in the pre-panchromatic emulsions used to produce the photographs.) </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In both ON and OFF the sky may look overcast, but you can see shadows. You have to look at the shadows on the cannonballs and from those shadows it may be possible to calculate the height of the sun in the sky.<br />
<span id="more-9353"></span><br />
Long before I journeyed to the Crimea, I attempted to look for evidence in the Fenton photographs themselves.  I had been shown <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Day-Picasso-Billy-Kluver/dp/0262611473/" target="new">an extraordinary book</a> by Billy Kluver, “A Day with Picasso.”  It sets the stage for what follows[1].  A University of California Berkeley-trained engineer, Kluver had collaborated with a number of artists, including John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol.   Over a period of some 20 years, Kluver had assembled a collection of photographs of Picasso, Modigliani and Moise Kisling, but it was not until fairly late in the game that Kluver surmised that the photographs were taken with one camera on four rolls of film, 24 pictures, six pictures on a roll – and that they were taken over a short period, possibly a single day.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>“When I came across the tenth photograph (No. 24 in the sequence in which they were taken) reproduced in the catalogue of the Modigliani exhibition at the Musee d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in spring of 1981, with its very distinct shadows on the buildings in the background, it occurred to me that if the buildings could be identified, it might be possible to use the shadows to determine the exact day and time the photographs were taken.” (From Kluver, &#8220;A Day with Picasso&#8221;)</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The first step for Kluver was sun-angle.  Then, various markers.  The awning of the Cafe de la Rotonde.  The foliage on trees.  Kisling’s dog, Kouski.  The dress worn by Picasso’s mistress, Paquerette.  Using these, he was able to order the 24 photographs, to determine that the photographs were taken on August 12, 1916, and to identify the photographer: Jean Cocteau.</p>
<div class="full-width"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/morris/posts/picasso002.jpg" alt=""/><span class="caption">Max Jacob standing by the tram tracks on the Boulevard du Montparnasse.  Ortiz and Picasso are standing with their backs to the camera.  The rays of the sun are almost perpendicular to the buildings on the Montparnasse.  2:15 p.m.</span></div>
<div class="full-width"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/morris/posts/picasso001.jpg" alt=""/><span class="caption">Picasso and his mistress, Paquerette, at the Cafe de la Rotonde. 2:20 p.m. The bar in the background is lit up by the sun, indicating that the sun is still nearly perpendicular to the buildings on Montparnasse.</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Fenton photographs offer few opportunities for this sort of forensic examination.  The lack of features that make the photographs a powerful metaphor for the desolation of war also make them a difficult source of information about shadows and sun-angle.  Where Kluver had buildings, light-posts and various people to cast different sorts of shadows at different times of day, as well as the correspondence of many of the people in the photographs, I had a couple of letters and an almost featureless landscape.  A kind of existentialist’s dream.  Something like a surrealist painting without the driftwood.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The cannonballs become the first and only place to look for shadows.  Nothing else in the picture casts one.  There are no trees; no landmarks of any kind, save for the dirt road and foot path that bisect the frame and disappear into the distance.  There is also nothing to tell us about the sky – it is washed out, featureless and dirty white.  Did a cloud pass across the sun, changing well-defined shadows to diffuse, murky lines?  Was there bright sunlight?  The sky – or lack of sky – is compatible with both.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Have a look at this sun-map for Sebastopol, April 1855.  The software is routinely used by gaffers (lighting technicians) in the motion picture business.  I set the latitude (44° 37’N) and longitude (33° 31’ E) for Sebastopol and the date, April 23, 1855.  (The software only goes back 100 years or so, but April 23, 1855, mercifully is much the same as April 23, 1955 – at least as far as sun-angle in Sebastopol is concerned.)</p>
<div class="full-width"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/morris/posts/SunMap3.jpg" alt=""/><span class="caption">Courtesy of sunPATH from www.wide-screen.com</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The sun-map tells us on April 23, 1855, the sun rose around 6 a.m. and set a little before 8 p.m.  It also tells us that the sun reached its zenith around 1 p.m. and was 60 degrees above the horizon from the south.  The sun at around 4 p.m. was about 40 degrees above the horizon.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The sun-map, of course, can take us just so far.  We have to know additional things.  Were the photographs taken in the morning or afternoon? Which direction was the camera facing – east, west, north or south? Happily, disagreements about the direction Fenton was facing when he took the picture were resolved by my trip to the Crimea.  I discovered that Fenton was facing north toward the shelling – toward Sebastopol.  Is this so surprising?  Isn’t this the first law of artillery?  Face the direction from where the fire is coming.  That way you don’t get hit in the back with a cannonball.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If we are facing north in the afternoon, from the sun diagram we would expect the cannonballs to be front-lit, then side-lit as the sun moved from east to west, that is from right to left.  (Of course, everything changes if we are facing south.  Then we would expect the shadows to be moving in the opposite direction. Direction and time-of-day are critical in determining the sequence – to understanding the shadows.)  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I began to have an uneasy feeling about my data.  Hovering close by was my arch nemesis, self-deception.  Had I convinced myself that the cannonballs were back-lit?  Or side-lit?  Or front-lit?  Were the shadows that distinct?  The sun-map showed that if the photographs were taken about an hour apart, then the sun moved not much more than a 10-degree arc – up and down or left or right.  Ten degrees is not that much.  Could it be accurately measured in the photographs – that subtle shifting of shadows from right to left or up and down?  And how long did it take Fenton to take the two photographs?  An hour?  More than an hour?  Perhaps.  But perhaps much less time elapsed.  Furthermore, armed with my 24-pound cannonball in the Crimea, as it became more and more hazy, the shadows on the cannonballs became less and less distinct.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I began to doubt myself.  I had entered the shadow-land of the shadows themselves[2].   Before I had determined the direction of Fenton’s camera, I had thought that the cannonballs in ON looked more top-lit than the cannonballs in OFF.  But then when I determined that we were looking north or north-northwest, not south or south-southeast, the cannonballs looked different. I mean, they <em>actually </em> looked different.  What was I measuring?  The shift in the shadows could be very small, too small for accurate measurement.  Furthermore, what did I know – what did I <em>really</em> know — about interpreting shadows?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Type in “shadow master” or “shadow expert” on Google, and a number of bizarre references pop up.  Connie Zweig, author of “Romancing the Shadow: A Guide to Soul Work for a Vital, Authentic Life” (with Steve Wolf), “an in-depth look at our hidden, wounded selves and how they form in early childhood&#8230;often wrecking [sic] havoc on our lives.”  Ms. Zweig was followed by how-to-do-it books on eye-shadow application, video games, comic-book heroes.  Eventually, Ralph Bouwmeester, an engineer and self-styled sun and shadow expert, popped up.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I got excited.  The very idea of “a shadow expert” conjures something out of film noir.  Armed with a set of sine and cosine tables, isn’t it possible to undermine the world?</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I sent Mr. Bouwmeester copies of ON and OFF and shortly afterward we got down to business.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">RALPH BOUWMEESTER:  The bottom line is that the checks and balances seem to point in the same direction, and I am coming up with a couple of decent times for the two pictures. Not only that, I’m sure you’re aware that there’s a stark difference in the objects that are visible in the two pictures.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  O.K.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">RALPH BOUWMEESTER:  Balls that appear in [OFF] all of a sudden are gone in [ON], as if they have been picked up from the hill and moved over to the road.  But the nature of the cannonballs on the road – just the way they look – appears to be different from the cannonballs on the hill in the foreground.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  I’m not sure I understand.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">RALPH BOUWMEESTER:  I don’t know how you would ever doctor these.  But, if these were digital photos, I’d be inclined to say that it was a poor job of cutting and pasting.  The perspective doesn’t seem to be 100 percent right from what I can see.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  How so?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">RALPH BOUWMEESTER:  What I’m trying to say is there are cannonballs that seem to be exactly the same size, some are in the foreground and some are set back further down the road.  When you measure them, they’re exactly the same size, which would happen if you were to clone them without resizing them.  There are many little inconsistencies like this that make me uncomfortable.  I’m not completely familiar with the various sizes, various kinds of cannonballs used in the Crimea. My understanding is that there were differences.  But just looking at the photographs, I get the feeling that we are looking at cannonballs of roughly the same size.  A lot of them[3]. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Bouwmeester was not proposing uncertainty; he was suggesting a conspiracy.  The cannonballs are all the same size?  Because they have been cloned?  How would this affect the measurement of sun-angle?  A spherical cannonball is a spherical cannonball is a spherical cannonball.  Would it make any difference – for calculating sun-angle – to know that one cannonball is a 24-pounder, another a 32-pounder?  Why the interest in the various diameters of cannonballs?  To prove that the photographs were doctored?  This was an even more damning claim than Sontag’s.  Not only did Fenton oversee the scattering of the balls, he possibly oversaw their cloning, using some Victorian version of Photoshop. – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This brings up something that greatly interests me: why people are attracted to conspiracy theories – even conspiracies of one – and to claims of posing, fakery and alteration.  We look at data.  It’s complex, hard to understand, but instead of trying to determine the meaning of the data, we leap to a simplistic conclusion: the data is not real data.  It has been doctored.  A group of people (or even one person) conspires to trick us, to give us false information, and we’re too smart to be fooled by such a conspiracy. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Isn’t Sontag’s theory something like that? She resolves a mystery simply by declaring it: a trick,  a plan to deceive[4].  The claim that a photograph is posed is a claim that the photographer intended to deceive the viewer.  It’s not that photographers never set out to fool or trick us, or that there are <em>no</em> conspiracies, it’s just that trickery (or conspiracy) is the last explanation I consider, not the first I jump to.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, possibly because of Photoshop and other photography-doctoring software, people have become suspicious of photographs.  This is a good thing.  It’s better to be on the tip of our toes about the possibility of error rather than oblivious to it.  But not every photograph has been tampered with.  Bouwmeester wasn’t analyzing shadows; he was looking for things hidden in the shadows. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We returned briefly to Bouwmeester’s original hunch: that the cannonballs had been removed from hillside and placed on the road.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: Have you done a count, by any chance?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">RALPH BOUWMEESTER:  I was thinking about it, but I thought the heck with that; I’m not going to count them. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dennis Purcell offered to help me count the cannonballs but was working overtime on a new invention for <a href="http://www.tenebraex.com" target="new">Tenebraex Corporation</a>, where he is senior scientist. He suggested that I talk to John Russ and Chris Russ, the father-son creators of Fovea Pro – <a href="http://www.reindeergraphics.com" target="new">a forensic photography program</a> for processing and measuring images.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">John Russ was busy, but Chris had time to look at the photographs and to do a forensic analysis.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Are you trying to go a step farther and say how much time went by?  Because it should be pretty simple to illustrate whether OFF comes before ON or ON comes before OFF.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Maybe it is simple, but I haven’t come up with an answer.  My first thought was: let’s try to compute sun angles from the shadows. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Well, you need to find the same object casting shadows with those images, which is not necessarily the easiest thing.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Except that there are cannonballs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Are they still there now?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  No.  They’re all gone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Did you go put new ones down?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  I did.  But only one.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  And you know that Fenton was looking northward?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Yeah.  North by northwest, like the movie.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  O.K., knowing that you&#8217;re pointing north-northwest in the afternoon, shadows will be longer on the right side later.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Yes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Well, I&#8217;m going to try to match the overall contrast between the two pictures, if I can. The top layer of [OFF] is considerably brighter in places.  So it’s got a much higher contrast.  So I could try to flatten that and see what I can do.  That’s about 151[5].   </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Here is where the problem began to look intractable.  If the contrast levels in the two photographs is different, what does that mean?  The hill on the left is darker in ON.  Lighter in OFF.  A cloud?  Haze?  A different time of day?  Or something more elusive?  An artifact of how the emulsion was put on the glass-plate, or how it was exposed, developed or printed?  With so many, many variables, how can one ever determine whether the shadows reflect real shadows or some artifact of the photographic process.  An epistemic shadow.  I was trying to figure out the next step.  One possibility: collecting photographs (from around the world because the Fenton prints had been widely dispersed), comparing them, trying to match the various versions of ON and the various versions of OFF.  It seemed painstaking and absurd, but would this be more absurd than what I had already done? – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  O.K, this is going to take a little bit of work to match the contrast between two images.   I would say that [ON] has a much more diffuse light than [OFF]. The shadow trick works pretty well on a no-cloud-in-the-sky day where you&#8217;ve got nice, sharp shadows.  The problem with one of these pictures is that it was taken at a time where there&#8217;s cloud cover.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  How do we know that? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  There are specular highlights on a great number of objects from [OFF].  [ON] is more diffusely illuminated.  I&#8217;m going to have to balance these pictures to match each other.   Let me play for a few minutes, I’ll be right back with you.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>A couple of hours later.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  I have balanced the two images out and I’ve got some observations. Looking at the two images, now that I’ve balanced the contrast and dealt with a few interesting printing artifacts, the shadows of the balls are very, very hard to measure.  So instead, I&#8217;m looking at the valley as a sort of a bowl shape that is lit in different places depending on the time of day.  You with me so far?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  I think so. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  And that&#8217;s consistent with the other way of measuring where the sun is – looking at the balls (because they&#8217;re spheres) and determining where the light is on them.  In OFF the light is further down toward the right.  In ON the balls seems to be lit over pretty much over the top half of the ball.  Closer to the middle of the day.  <em>[The sun is at its zenith around 1 p.m. – E.M.]</em> Assuming afternoon for both, and assuming a camera direction of north-northwest, then ON was taken first.  I’ll try to balance the gray scale between the images using the road itself.  There are specular highlights in OFF.  It’s very, very specular, making me think there are no clouds at that point.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Specular highlights?  What do you mean?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  O.K., the difference between a bright metal surface and a polished plastic surface is the plastic seems flat and the metal has a bright spot on it relative to where the light source is.  That bright light source is a specular highlight.  That happens with material if you&#8217;ve got something that&#8217;s polished versus something that isn’t.  It also happens with the same subject if you change the light from being a single point source, which you have on a sunny day, to a diffuse light source, which you have on a cloudy day.  So one of the things that&#8217;s causing problems for us is that one of these pictures was taken – and you can tell that by the contrast of the picture – one was taken with clouds and the other was taken with no clouds.  So that&#8217;s one of the things that’s going on.  Considering that, I felt that because the balls were metal, they might not be as good a measure as the countryside itself.  Therefore, it’s important to know the angle of the hills on the sides of the road and the road itself.  That&#8217;s the part I started looking at.  Because first I felt, “Oh well, let me compare the relative shadow from left to right on the two different sides of the road.”  When I first did that, I got the impression that ON happened earlier in the day than OFF, with the sun going further over because the embankment on the right side got brighter.  Now, this is all completely backwards if Fenton’s pointing southward instead of northward. The thing is, how close together in time do you think they’re taken?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  I don’t really know.  I’ve talked to a number of people about how long it took to take the two photographs.  Fenton says that he stayed about an hour and a half and got two pictures, but I believe the interval between the two photographs was determined not by the time it took to prepare the two plates, but by the time needed to place the cannonballs on to or to take the cannonballs off of the road. My guess is that Fenton wouldn&#8217;t have lingered there for very long.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  There is one other thing different between these two images that makes it so hard to tell anything from the lighting.  In ON, there&#8217;s a hill off in the distance – just straight ahead – that is roughly the same intensity of the embankment on the right.  In OFF the hill’s considerably brighter.  And I&#8217;m trying to figure out what that means.  Because we could be chasing our tails in a circular argument just because of what the clouds do.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Now, the other observation I have is the number of balls that seem to be missing from the left side and present on the road are not consistent.  A lot more show up in the road than disappear from the side.  And most of the ones in the major gully, which are where the vast majority of the balls are, don’t change, although a couple have moved slightly.   </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Another odd thing, of course, is if you look, there&#8217;s that dirt path that you see coming down on the left, and you’ll notice again just to camera left of that path, there&#8217;s a rock which is present in ON, but absent in OFF.   I’ve named the rock “Esmeralda.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Why add a rock?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: Or subtract a rock? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS: Yes, I saw that rock.  I was using the rock that&#8217;s further up that path.  It’s present in both, a fairly large rock, given the distance, as my primary method of balancing brightness.  Because I felt that the side to the camera of that rock was least likely to be affected by the lighting. But why would someone add the rock?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Where is the logic here?  I don’t know.  Maybe someone rolled the rock down from further up the hill.  Maybe Fenton thought there were too many rocks in the photograph.  Maybe he thought there were not enough.  Maybe Esmeralda improved or loused up his composition.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[At this juncture Chris had given up on the detail of how each cannonball had been lit by the sun and was now concerned with the global pattern of lighting of the landscape. – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  That hilltop off in the distance is very interesting.  It would have had strategic value, or I should say at least tactical value.  I&#8217;m going to do some toggling to see if I can get a shot of it.  I don&#8217;t think he gathered up cannonballs from a remote site and put them in the road.  I think he just moved them.  I don&#8217;t think he added to the scene; he just moved them.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this lighting a little bit more.  If we assume that we&#8217;re looking uphill instead of down, then I think it is consistent with OFF being earlier.  Because now you&#8217;ve got light further down the road, which is on the other side, and if we’re looking northwest, then that works.  It’s all about the topology of the land.  Let’s look at OFF.  If I&#8217;m looking somewhat uphill, then we’ve got light up here, but also down there in the valley.  And in ON, there&#8217;s just light down there because the sun has gone further down.  It’s only lit down there because the side up here isn’t pointing toward the sun anymore.  So OFF would be earlier in the day than ON.  It’s a function of what can be hit by the sun and how far toward northwest you&#8217;re at.  I don&#8217;t know.  I’ve flipped back and forth at least three times in the last hour.  So we really need to get an idea of direction.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  I’m convinced we are looking north.  We’re looking down into the valley, although the hills that you see to the right and to the left of the road trend up from the road.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  There are objects in the scene that have been moved, and you might argue that someone walked through there.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Someone had to have walked through there.  Something happened between the two photographs.  The cannonballs didn’t just roll off or on to the road.  Someone moved them – even if it wasn’t Fenton.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  I would like to find an area where there is a footprint in one but no footprint in the other.  The erasing of a footprint is a whole lot different than moving a rock.  But this ground is too hard for that, which makes me wonder why I’ve got these blown out highlights in OFF on the left side of the image.  There are some very, very bright points on the road.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[All of a sudden there was an exclamation from Chris Russ.  It was a Eureka moment for him, but I was no longer sure what he was talking about.  Had we both retreated into a pixel-based pixilated fantasy-land? – E.M.]</em> </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Bingo!  Bingo!  You know that hill in the distance?  Let’s say we’re close to sunset in the second shot.  It would be lit up.  Earlier in the day, it wouldn&#8217;t be.   O.K., there&#8217;s this other hill&#8230;  There&#8217;s another hill, interestingly enough, over toward the left.  Do you mind if I take the phone and beat it against my head for a couple of minutes?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Please don’t injure yourself on my account over this. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Oh, don’t worry.  This is a very intriguing puzzle.  One trick that&#8217;s going to help you: after you scan the images at high resolution, change your Photoshop mode to 16 bits.   That won’t do anything right away, but then change the image size.  And what that’s going to do is: every new pixel is going to be made up of original pixels from before, and will produce much better averages and give you tonality.  And then as you start stretching and compressing contrast, you might start to see something.  I reduced my image size down to about 2,000 wide from the 5,000 we attempted before, and it let me do some things.  Got rid of some, some but not all of the speckle.  But it also let me see some definition, some tone on the back of rocks.  A useful trick.  I am hoping to find a footprint.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Find a footprint!  The mark of Fenton?  Of  his assistant, Sparling?  Or some nameless British soldier?  The unknown soldier with a mark in one of the iconic pictures of the Crimean War?  A phantom?  A clue?  And just what was Chris’s Eureka moment?  Later, he told me what was going through his head:  He went from (1) looking at the cannonballs as reflective spheres that should show the direction of the light; to (2) looking for some kind of addition to the scene that might indicate the passage of time, e.g., a footprint,; and then, finally, to (3) looking at the valley as a bowl in which he could study an overall change in the lighting,  The Eureka moment was, presumably, the moment he abandoned looking at lighting on the cannonballs and started looking at the overall pattern of the light on the landscape. – E.M.]</em>  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  I’ve got a proposal for you.  Let’s say the person on the hill was chucking balls down toward the gully from the left.  Later, they walked down and picked some up and put them in the road.  That would account for why a number of rocks have been moved toward the right.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  The cannon balls could have been coming from camera right to left.  Now, they could have overshot the road and then rolled down that hill —</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  But where did the balls come from?  There are some that are in OFF that are not in ON and vice versa.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  This could lead to madness, no?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  The cloud cover makes arguments about shadows ineffective.  If the time of day was close together, you could get information here.  But what if instead of 30 minutes, it was three hours?  You know, it would certainly make sense that if they were the same caliber ball, then you could chuck them back.   I&#8217;m finding a small number of objects, it’s not very many, that are present in OFF that are not present in ON.  Some are balls, some are rocks. As opposed to a few cases where I found things that clearly had been moved.  Same object, but its position has changed.  It is completely consistent with the theory that this is staged.  But there is no proof here that it is one or the other.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Staged in the sense that he put the cannon balls on the road?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  That the balls were not present in the first photo, were added in the second.  If the man is a hero, then they came in over an hour and a half.  If the man is a marketeer, then he put them there himself.  Think about &#8220;Alice’s Restaurant.&#8221;  Rather than bring that pile of garbage up, we decide to throw ours down.  Why go to the trouble of throwing it over the hill on the left side when you could dump them in the gully?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  So now you think that ON is the second photograph?  Isn’t this a complete reversal from your initial view?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Yes.  It is.  I think the balls are local and the balls were moved on to the road for contrast because there is a plethora of balls in OFF.  The number of new balls is not a very significant number compared to the number that are already there.  So it’s probably for purposes of making the picture – for aesthetic purposes.  Not to say, hey, look how dangerous my life is.  Because in both pictures, if you look at the number of balls in the gully, it outnumbers the ones on the road by a factor of five easily. So the number of balls that&#8217;s different is a relatively small percentage, and I bet they came from the hill on the left.  So I think this is more for the purposes of creating a pretty picture than for being boastful.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Clearly, you could make the argument that it makes the picture more graphic because you can see the cannonballs more clearly.  The black balls are contrasted against the relatively light surface of the road.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Sure.  He may have even waited for a cloud to block out the sun to get a better tonality, a better picture.  If he’s a photographer, he’s going to do the best he can to control lighting.  It’s what I would do.  He found his spot, and it was a matter of getting the light right and moving some of the balls so that the picture would be better.  He was composing.  The characterization of this as being a function of (lack of) bravado is probably well overstated.  He did make a very nice picture to present the story better, given the medium he had at the time – black and white, limited dynamic range of brightness and darkness.  This gives it the kind of contrast that tells the story better, but I don&#8217;t think it’s not true.  So I do think that he modified the scene, but I don&#8217;t think he did it in a manner that&#8217;s illegitimate.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: So, ON is the second photograph?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  The logic for removing them from the road — that would leave the others that are in the gully next to the road.  If they were in that order, wouldn&#8217;t it involve putting these ones that are on the road into the gully?  I couldn’t find a motive for that direction.  If the balls in the road were removed, there are other things I would have expected to have moved, too.  If someone was taking the balls to shoot them back, there are five times as many balls in the gully, why not take them from there, too?  Conversely, if you&#8217;re removing them from the road to be able to travel down the road, they’d probably end up in the gully or in the gully on the other side.  That does not appear to have happened.  Furthermore, if you were doing that, why would you remove them from the road, why would you put them over on the hill on the left side in a convenient declivity?  It doesn’t make sense.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  O.K.  But then your main reason for believing OFF comes before ON is based on the psychology of people, about why they do the things they do, about how they would act, do act, have acted – independent of the question of what we can learn from the photograph itself?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  There are the things I can learn from the photograph itself.  That there&#8217;s a difference between the pictures and their lighting that is consistent with the hour and a half that he’s talking about…  If someone very kindly put in a true vertical pole and pointed the camera in a known direction.  But if we’re sloping slightly downhill north by northwest, then the western sun is going to light up the ground.  But then please explain to me why the ground is considerably darker in OFF than ON?  The only thing that comes to mind is: because the light is more diffuse.  So let’s look at OFF, which has relatively darker ground compared to the ruts in the road.  How can we be pointing north-northwest and have dark ground?  Could it be that we are in the shadow of the hill to the left?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  So you&#8217;re saying that —</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  If we really were in the shadows, then we wouldn’t have highlights on the cannonballs.  So the thought was to use a different surface that isn’t going to be in shadow, and there are two.  There&#8217;s the hill in the far distance at 1:00, and then there&#8217;s the nearer embankment on the right side of the road.  Well, it’s brighter in OFF than in ON – which I suppose could mean the sun has dropped further.  The hill in the distance does the same thing, but the hill is not a plane, it is a curved surface, and if they were an hour and a half apart and one was at 3:00 and one was at 4:30, the sun would have had to have been a lot further down.  It’s diffuse in ON and therefore we can’t tell what the time is in that picture. I bet he waited until a cloud got in front of the sun, and then he took the picture.  He first got a picture of the spot, and then he got the picture he wanted to print.  The first picture was because he had a feeling that it was going to be a good picture, and he didn&#8217;t know if that was the only he was going to get.  And the second one is the one he wanted to publish.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[A feeling?  Have we come full circle while chasing our tails?  Had Chris embraced the same bugaboo – Fenton’s intentions?  What was Fenton thinking?  Was Chris disappearing into the crepuscular world of the shadows themselves – the madness of curved surfaces, diffuse versus specular light, sun-angles, real and imagined.  Or perhaps the madness of the pathetic fallacy, the fallacy of seeing Fenton, himself, lurking in the shadows of the cannonballs? – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  If the picture’s taken in a studio, I think it’s pretty much safe to say that it is posed.  And photography that is done where the subject is not aware of your presence, an argument could be made that that is not.  That’s certainly true for people.  Once he changed the scene, he ceased to simply be an observer.  That&#8217;s what a purist could say.  Then the follow-up question would be did he substantively change the scene?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  But if you just had that picture in front of you, and it was OFF that was posed, how would you ever be able to even answer such a question?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  Well, the whole point is we can’t.  But if it were posed, I wouldn’t say it’s egregious.  It’s compositional.  The balls are readily available because they’re there, and the contrast in the picture shows them very nicely on the road because the road appeared quite bright.  It looks like he was looking for the contrast, and that would also be consistent with picking a diffuse time of day for the photograph. If someone is saying that he is going to great lengths to puff up his reputation, I would say: no, you&#8217;re wrong.  If someone is trying to be the purist and say that he modified the scene, I would probably agree but say: it was just for aesthetics, it certainly wasn&#8217;t for any other purpose.  Because putting cannonballs on the road does add to the aesthetics of the image.  That seems to be the primary reason.  He’s a photographer, that’s the way those people think.  Look at Matthew Brady, Fenton, of course, fast forward to Ansel Adams.  They&#8217;re developing a whole new art form, and we’re learning about both what they themselves saw and how to present it.  Ansel Adams was renowned for doing an immense amount of work in the dark room: to show the kinds of things that he wanted because the process itself, particularly paper, was very limited in what kind of contrast it would show. So he did an awful lot to emphasize contrast in ink and to show detail.  But if you were there as an observer, you could have seen that images don’t really survive the process of being slapped on paper.  This I believe was Fenton’s primary concern. Do I think that a number of things could be determined by just looking at a picture?  Yes.  But we need to know things about it to add information to the scene.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Isn’t Chris arguing that to interpret a picture we need more than the picture itself?  We need context.    Is he saying we can learn things from a photograph, but we can’t learn things from just a photograph? – E.M.]</em>  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One of the things we do in image analysis is we control the situation under which the image was taken so we can make these inferences.  Even Ansel Adams did things in the darkroom.  I don&#8217;t know what the equivalents were in 1854.  It would be very interesting to know what Fenton did.  Clearly, changing the stage a little bit is well within the realm of possibility, and waiting for the right kind of lighting is in the realm.  I’ve done shoots that are at sunrise or sunset because of the color and the angle of the sun.  I&#8217;m sure he was aware of it.  If you go back to the 1700’s, they were aware of it in their paintings.  The problem with the scientific side of it is that the photographer was not a neutral observer.  He picked the best picture he could find.  That&#8217;s the problem when you look at a picture in a scientific journal and underneath it there&#8217;s a little caption that says, “Representative image.”  It’s not a representative image, that’s the only one the guy ever got.  Or the prettiest one he ever got.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Are you asked to do much criminal forensic work?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  I do some, and a number of my tools go to people who do that.  We’re constantly battling the “CSI” effect.  I&#8217;m sure you know what that is.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Tell me.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CHRIS RUSS:  It’s where people watch “CSI” on television and assume that we can do all sorts of things that we can’t.  So they’ll keep zooming in on a picture and zooming in and ultimately they turn a pixel into a face.  That&#8217;s science fiction; that&#8217;s not real.  But there are some things that we can do.  For instance, when the Hubble telescope went up, it was nearsighted for three years.  We had to use it anyway, so we were able to compute just how nearsighted it was and do a mathematical transform called deconvolution on it, and with the 15 percent of the light that it did manage to capture, we’d make good pictures out of.  Once they fixed the optics, then we were capturing all the light and the pictures were that much better.  There are some things that are doable, and there are some things that aren’t.  I could do amazing things if I could get my hands on this guy’s camera and retrace his optics.  I could do even better if I could get my hands on his plates, but all we have are these prints.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[The prints are distributed in public and private photography collections around the globe.  There is something deeply unsettling about the thought that all the evidence might depend on a print.  Why one print over another?  Which print?  If all the prints are different, where is reality?  How can the real world be recovered from the simulacrum?  Antonioni’s “Blow-Up” is often taken as an essay on the subjectivity of truth.  But it is closer to the opposite.  Photographs suggest things.  David Hemmings, as the photographer, thinks he sees a gun in the shadows and a corpse in the park.  The photographs suggest a gun in the shadows, suggest a corpse in the park.  But Antonioni makes it clear they are really there.  The corpse is real.  We watch as David Hemmings returns to the park and touches the corpse.  We, the audience, as well as he, the photographer, know that there is a corpse – there is a fact-of-the-matter.  But where is the fact-of-the-matter here? – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Fenton got back from the Crimea, there was a show in London of his photographs organized by Agnew, his publisher.  But from the brochures of the show, it’s impossible to tell which of the valley pictures was exhibited. It’s interesting that the first major monograph on Fenton, which was written in the 1950’s by Helmut Gernsheim, has dozens of Fenton photographs but lo and behold, OFF is in the monograph – not ON.   Why?  Why did Gernsheim pick that photograph?  Did he not have the pair?  Was OFF the only one he had?  If aesthetic considerations make ON the better of the two photographs (as argued by Chris Russ), why show OFF in what was intended to be the definitive work on Fenton’s photography?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I contacted Roy Flukinger at <a href="http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/photography/holdings/gernsheim/" target="new">the Harry Ransom Center</a>. Flukinger who was the curator of the Gernsheim collection, including his collection of Fenton photographs:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  One thing that has puzzled me – in the Gernsheim book [“Roger Fenton, Photographer of the Crimean War with an Essay on his Life and Work,” by Helmut and Alison Gernsheim], they reproduce OFF.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  I’m not certain I could tell you.  I do know that probably both were sold in the portfolio sets.  But which one he exhibited in his exhibition at the Photographic Society, I don’t know.   </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  I’m sure Gernsheim knew of the existence of both photographs.  I’m sure he had both in the set, because Gernsheim’s collection came from Fenton’s own set of Crimean photographs.  Now, why Gernsheim chose [OFF] over [ON], I have never been able to find out.  I’m right now in the middle of researching and writing a big book on how Gernsheim put his collections together.  He very unkindly didn’t leave one essay that said how the collection was formed.  It’s all over Gernsheim’s manuscripts, and I’m going through all that right now.  I don’t think there’s anything but the actual mounted prints that date the Fenton photographs in any way, shape or form.  I don’t think there’s any reference to when one image was made as opposed to another.  I’ve never seen anything like that anyway.  Now one can argue that because of the slowness of the speed and exposures of everything, most of Fenton’s images were posed, in terms of people and figures and groups – things like that.  So that is, to that extent, a manipulation of quote/unquote “the truth.”  But I just can’t imagine him gathering together a bunch of people and rolling cannonballs out there in that valley to make the picture. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[“I just can’t imagine him…”  Of course, we can imagine Fenton “gathering together a bunch of people and rolling cannonballs.”  There are two separate issues here – the issue of posing and the question of which came first.

But it doesn’t matter in theory whether OFF came before ON or vice versa, either or both could still be posed.

And it was he who ultimately put the issue to rest by isolating the essential detail from the many false trails that led nowhere.  Dennis looked at the hard facts of the photographs themselves and arrives at a beautiful, absolutely convincing solution, which once read, seems simple.   But isn’t that the quality of great solutions. The series of events are as follows: first no one can figure out the problem, while trotting out numerous equivocal solutions.  Then they hear the solution, which seems so utterly simple and say: Now why didn’t I think of that”?[6]   </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We were scrutinizing individual rocks in the Fenton photographs.  Dennis had given them names.  He, too, had felt the emotional pull of the pathetic fallacy, but oddly enough, he had also named rocks and boulders – not cannonballs. How odd what 150 years brings.  For Kinglake, it was the cannonballs that were alive.  For us, the rocks in the landscape.  The cannonballs <em>speak</em> to the Victorians; the rocks, to us.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: This direction is downhill.  So here’s rock Lionel in OFF and here’s rock Lionel in ON.  These two other guys haven’t moved. They’re a bit embedded. Somebody kicked this rock, and it ended up here.  Here’s George.  All it did was just go a short distance like that, but it’s a little lower down here than it is here. There are others. There are little tiny ones. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: What are the two objects that you’re looking at?  Is this Lionel?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: Yeah. And this is George.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: Oh, this is George.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: It’s up there, and it just went like this. That’s all it did. These are small movements. This is the Lionel piece just here and that’s it over there. These three are all exactly the same. Even this one is the same.  So if you isolate this little piece and just go back and forth.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: It moved this way?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: It moved that way. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: And there is no way to balance the contrast between these two photographs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL:  No.  You can for small patches, but not for the image as a whole. Despite all the warping and stuff I did – I couldn’t quite make the two whole pictures match.  They’re very close but shrinkage of the gelatin or whatever this thing was on – makes it impossible.  But you can make a small area match almost precisely, and then as you flip between one and the other, you just say, “What changed here?”  If you’re looking at a small area – a lot is going on because some balls move and some don’t. How big are these cannonballs?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: They’re not that big.  About the size of a grapefruit.  A 24-pounder is smaller than you would think. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: And here’s a small rock.  You can sort of see it’s got a point and two bumps on it. It’s the same one as that.  And again, it’s moved downhill as though someone carrying something kicked it and it slid. Now it’s down here. When you just pull out a smaller section, you just get this feeling of something that happened there. But looking overall you can’t do that because – the pictures really aren’t the same in graininess or contrast, and there’s a tremendous amount of garbage in these photos.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: I should try to find out more details on where these digital files came from and which prints were involved.  But have you, now, come to believe [along with Sontag and Keller] that ON was second?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Dennis had started pondering the issue of randomness.  Just how random was the placement of cannonballs on the road.  Did they roll there?  Were they left to be harvested later by British soldiers? Or was the arrangement of the cannonballs aesthetic, intended to be pleasing to the eye?  Could one see the hand of Fenton in their placement?   And if not Fenton, the hand of someone else? – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: The placement is too good.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: The placement is too good…?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: Right, they’re just nicely placed in the frame. “Let’s just fill up this area and make it look good.”  Cannonballs roll into low places. There’s a gutter. This is another gutter. It’s like a bowling alley. Most of the cannonballs end up in the gutter. They do not end up sitting on the road. If they’re rolling at all they’re going to roll into this gully at the side of the road.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Hold on a second.  Here’s a picture of Olga Makarova, our Russian guide. I’ll try to get the other pictures for you. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL:  No.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Let’s see if I can find it.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL:  That’s nice. That’s a real Lee Friedlander.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Thank you.  And this is the picture that Bob Chappell took in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: It’s the same road. Look at this!  There it is.  Oh my god. There it is! That’s Marmaduke.  The picture is pretty darn good.  It’s quite similar – for 150 years.  Subtract a few bushes, and you’re back to where you were. How many things in the world have changed so little in 150 years?  How in the world, where there’s so much information, can there be such a high level of ignorance?  Certainly the more information we get, the higher the level of ignorance seems to be.<br />
<em><br />
[A pause while we reflect on the higher level of ignorance – including our own. – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  So it’s based on those two guys, George and Lionel.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: Those two guys plus Marmaduke – or whatever we want to call him. Those two went down. These two went this way. There’s one over here and there are others up in here.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: So the whole shadow thing turns out to be a red herring?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: It doesn’t give us the answers we’re looking for.  If you matched the contrast in the two photographs perfectly, there hardly seems to be any difference. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Yet, from the motion of rocks, you can determine which photograph was taken first.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL:  Absolutely.  The rocks move in the direction of gravity.  First look at the motion of the rocks, then look at the photographs.  The rocks move from up to down.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Here is the essential point.  When the rocks are uphill – before they have been dislodged – look at the road to see whether the balls are on it or not.  When the rocks are uphill, and you look at the road, you see that the balls are off the road [OFF].  Then, you look at the rocks after they have been dislodged – rocks that were kicked and then tumbled downhill – the balls are on the road [ON].  In short, the first shot had to be taken when the balls were uphill.  We can see: rocks up, balls off the road.   And, the second shot, when the balls tumble down a bit, rocks down, balls on the road.  It is the law of gravity that allows us to order the photographs. Dennis continues. – E.M.]</em></p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: Take the question of the moon landing.  There are people who believe that it was fabricated in a studio.  The question is how do you really know they’re on the moon?  It’s pretty simple. Because the dust that they kicked up fell straight to the ground.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS: It did?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL: It didn’t float. It dropped.  It was very strange looking. The dust that they kicked up instantly plunged straight down in a way that no dust on Earth would. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>[Dust on earth is suspended by the Brownian motion of molecules in the atmosphere, but there is no atmosphere on the moon. – E.M.]</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So the question is: how could you fake this? There were people saying that they faked it. They never were on the moon. They just did it in their training camp in the Black Hills or wherever it was they trained. But you can’t fake dust plunging straight down. There’s no way to do that.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Dust-Plunging-Straight-Down Test.  I had a strange intuition.  What about a different kind of test – about the notion of “posing?”  A <em>gedanken experiment</em>.  Say, for the sake of argument, Susan Sontag is right.  Fenton posed one of the photographs, but she’s wrong about the order.  They are in the reverse order to the one claimed by Sontag, Keller and Haworth-Booth, and e<em>stablished</em> by Dennis Purcell.  Consider this hypothetical -story.  Fenton came across the balls on the road and scattered them on the hillside, thereby posing the picture that he took of the road without the balls on it [OFF].  (It doesn’t matter <em>why</em> he did it – just that he intended to do it.  It wasn’t inadvertent.)  But if OFF is posed, it’s posed because of the absence of something.  The cannonballs should have, could have been there, but Fenton altered the landscape by removing them.  Couldn’t you argue that every photograph is posed because every photograph <em>excludes</em> something?  In every photograph <em>something</em> is absent.  Someone has made a decision about what time-slice to expose on the emulsion, what space-slice to expose on the emulsion.  Fenton could have had an elephant in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, plus all the workers you might imagine heaving cannonballs about.  The elephant could have been walking through the frame of Fenton’s camera, and Fenton just waited until the elephant left the frame.  Or told Sparling, his assistant: “Get rid of the elephant.”  He posed the photograph, but how would you know?  It’s posed not by the presence of the elephant but by its absence.  Isn’t something always excluded, elephant or otherwise?  </p>
<div class="full-width"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/morris/posts/thelongwalkelephant.jpg" alt=""/><span class="caption"> This, of course, is not the Valley of the Shadow of Death.  It is a Fenton photograph taken after his return from the Crimea.  The idea of excluding the elephant from the frame should be clear. The Long Walk at Windsor Castle.  Roger Fenton, 1860.<br />
</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I know.  It is insane, but I would like to make the claim that the meaning of photography is contained in these two images.  By thinking about the Fenton photographs we are essentially thinking about some of the most vexing issues in photography – about posing, about the intentions of the photographer, about the nature of photographic evidence – about the relationship between photographs and reality.  We also have the first motion picture because we have two images in sequence.   We just don’t know (at first) what the sequence is because they are not conjoined in celluloid.  One further point.  Isn’t much of science the attempt to fill in what happened between two moments of time, t₀ and t₁?  To explain how and why something changed?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">DENNIS PURCELL:  I feel the gravity argument is very strong.  If you stepped up to pick up something, you’d just kick a stone or two.  The smaller is the more significant because no one would have noticed that and no one would have kicked it uphill by accident.  I find that pretty strong.  And I find the sun-angle business ambiguous and paradoxical. The shadows are not that different.  If you add and subtract contrast, the shadow position is almost the same.  You do it and you say, “Which one of these is different in which way?”  You can’t tell because the slightest amount of adding or subtracting contrast, darkening this and lightening this, moves the shadow. So there really isn’t much difference between the shadows in ON and OFF.  You can move that shadow around the ball just by lightening and darkening it.  I don’t get much out of the shadows, but I get a lot out of the little guys who were kicked aside.  Some of those rocks, those main boulders, they’re still there.  The cannonballs are gone, but the rocks are still there.  It would be nice to find that funny one with the two bumps and the nose.  The rocks have very distinct characters, whereas the cannonballs have none.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Shortly after our discussion, Dennis sent me a note.  It powerfully summarizes his reasoning on these issues.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Dear Errol:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’ve worked some more on the images, and with warping and equalization have brought them a bit more into sync, so that quickly flipping between the two pictures reveals more of the detail and less of the distracting large-scale brightness differences.  When you do flip them, making a two-image movie, you see of course a lot of change in cannonball location.  But you also see movement of non-cannonball features.   And my case rests (quite firmly, I think) on the two close-up views.  These show movement of inconspicuous rocks that have been kicked, jostled or vibrated. Each one has ended up lower down the hill.  I haven’t found any that went the other way. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is really difficult to imagine a scenario in which all these objects, at some distance from each other, would spontaneously move uphill.  So I just can’t see any way in which the cannonballs-on-the-road view comes first.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some less conclusive but corroborating evidence: a very careful count shows that there are the same number of balls in both pictures (about 250, if I remember correctly).  So no one has gone around policing up the balls for reuse or any other reason.  They have been removed from the surrounding area and placed on the road.   Another point, and this is only an impression, is that the placement of balls on the road is too nicely and evenly “random.”  It’s sort of like the error that people make when they try to invent a “random” sequence of numbers: much too well distributed and avoiding runs and oddities.  Here, the dynamic physical forces and rough terrain form a kinetic system in which there will not likely be a nice pattern spread out in open space (and nicely in camera-range) but rather a strong tropism for local minima – which we see in the first picture where most of the balls are “in the gutter” or in depressions on the hillside.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As for the interview, I’m not sure what approach to take in editing it.  Not being one of those professorial types who can talk in whole paragraphs (never mind sentences), I think my interview reads as pretty sketchy – and I was sort of making it up in the context of our conversation.  Maybe it’s more interesting that way; I don’t know.  I think the points I mentioned above are in there, but perhaps not expressed with the confidence I now feel.  Let me know how I should proceed!</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dennis</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">How to proceed?  Dennis has solved the problem.  There is no way – at least as far as I can see – to wiggle out of his argument.  And so, it turns out that Keller, Haworth-Booth and Sontag are right.  It is OFF before ON.  I tried hard to prove that Keller and Sontag were wrong – to prove that ON came before OFF.  I failed.  I can’t deny it.  But I did prove that they were right for the wrong reasons.  It is not their assessment of Fenton’s character or lack of character that establishes the order of the pictures. Nor is it sun-angle and shadow.  Rather it is the motion of ancillary rocks – rocks that had been kicked, nudged, displaced between the taking of one picture and the other.  Rocks that no one cared about. “Those little guys that got kicked aside.”  Their displacement was recorded on those wet collodion plates not because someone wanted to record it.  It happened inadvertently.  Ancillary rocks, ancillary evidence – essential information.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The one thing that we know about the rocks — Marmaduke, George, Lionel, Oswald and Fred — is that they were not posed.  No one noticed them, let alone posed them.  But together they helped unlock the secret of how to order the Fenton photographs. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Photographs preserve information.  They record data.  They present evidence.  Not because of our intentions but often in spite of them.  Sontag, Keller and Haworth-Booth could be right about the order of the photographs, but nothing that they have said shows that one photograph – either ON or OFF – or both photographs were posed.  We know nothing about any such thing.  Chris Russ had noticed that the rocks were moving towards the road, but he didn’t take the next step.  He didn’t see how gravity provided an independent path to reality – a path separate from sun-angle.  Dennis steadfastly defends Chris Russ.  He makes a comparison between a police detective and a prosecutor.  It was Chris’s job to uncover the evidence, Dennis’s job to make the case before a jury.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the very end of my discussion with Roy Flukinger, he turned to the mystery of photographs – the mystery of recording light and shadow without telling us what they mean.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  It’s one of the fascinating things about photo history.  It always gives us more questions than answers.  Historical photographs may give you the possibility of new facts, and may give you the chance to ask new questions.  The thing I like about old photographs is that they offer me a different sort of visual, and hopefully, therefore, emotional experience to what I’m looking at, that words can’t do, or that words can only do part of.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  Something beyond language?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  Definitely.  There’s a whole other level that reaches a person through the eyes.  And I just find that fascinating.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  How would you describe that “other level”?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  Photography has a certain immediacy – not only in the taking, but also at the end of the equation, the presenting of the image to a viewer.  There’s a strong chance for distortion of fact or for inadequate – no, not inadequate, shall we say, limited amount of experience.  But there’s always something that’s possible to be revealed and shared in the process.   If you sit down and really lay out these portfolios of prints on a table, and look at them for an afternoon – we’ve got a big wall easel here so we can lay out a bunch of them – and you move them around and look at them, you really get a sense of what it must have been like to be there – even a level of goose-bump experience.  That’s the sort of power that photography can have.  If you’re looking at the original prints the way the photographer printed them, and wanted to make them known, that possibility is enhanced, even beyond just what’s reproduced in a book.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ERROL MORRIS:  The feeling of being there?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">ROY FLUKINGER:  At least a better sense of being there, a better sense of the emotional experience that went into the creation of the image.  Fenton was there – freezing his butt off and getting in the mud and everything else.  That’s something you experience when you look at the roughness of the prints and the detail of the imagery – that is, when you stop and look at what’s there in the photographs.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">……………</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">POSTSCRIPT: History is always incomplete. There is always the possibility that new historical evidence can be found.  A safe crammed with documents, photographs in a hatbox, a packet of letters tied with a faded yellow-ribbon.  I spoke with Dennis Purcell recently and asked, “Do you think these essays will put this issue – the issue of which came first – finally to rest.”  Dennis replied, “No.  I don’t think so. There could be some guy who reads your essays, writes in, and says: &#8216;You know, there aren’t just two photographs.  I found another.  There are actually three.’ ”</p>

<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">1.  I was first shown the book by Lydia Davis, a friend of mine from the Putney School.  I felt that I was in the presence of a kindred spirit.  Kluver was someone clearly obsessed by using empirical methods to determine details about photographs, particularly their sequence.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">2. I have written about this very phenomenon in a previous Times essay, <a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/will-the-real-hooded-man-please-stand-up/">“Will the Real Hooded Man Please Stand Up.”</a> </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">3. I had previously contacted Alastair Massie, the Director of the National Army Museum in London and the author of several books on the Crimean War.  He sent several helpful emails. One clarified the size of the cannonballs:  “At Sevastopol the guns in use for siege operations were 68, 32, and 24 pounders. This is the weight of shot fired. These heavy guns were mostly ones taken off ships; both sides did this…”  A second email discussed the range of the guns: “The heaviest ordnance could fire at a range of up to two miles: this is why the British had to site their camp further than that away from Sevastopol (but by supercharging their guns the Russians could still reach the camp).  We have a Crimean War 68 pounder gun sitting outside the Museum and its bore is just over 10 inches, so the diameter of the largest cannonball you can see in the picture will be 10 inches.” – The cannonball I borrowed from the Panorama Museum was a 24- pounder.  I suppose if I had been utterly scrupulous, I would have tried to lug a 32- and a 68-pounder up to the Valley of the Shadow of Death as well.  I have an excuse, however.  The 24-pounder was the only cannonball they lent me.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">4. The claim that a photograph is posed is essentially  a “conspiracy theory.” It is a claim that the photographer intended to deceive the viewer.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">5. Contrast is calibrated on a scale of 1:255.  So 151 is approximately in the middle of the scale.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">6. Well, not exactly.  More often than not they say, “Oh, I knew that already,” or “That’s obvious.”  It’s a somewhat different use of the word “obvious” – used in this instance to dismiss an explanation provided by others as so simple as to be self-evident.</p></blockquote>

			<p>How sublime that a few pioneer photographs should inspire such ingenious investigation and analysis.  Meanwhile, we are bombarded daily with photos and videos that are elaborately posed, edited, enhanced or selected to manipulate opinion, without any occasion to second guess.</p>
<p>Oh, and a serious question, how does one pick up sky details without wrecking the rest of the picture?  UV filters darken the forground and exagerate the shadows and contrasts.  Graduated filters darken any faces or other objects (mountain tops, etc) that reach the upper part of the frame.  Any digicams that have a &#8220;sky eye&#8221; software that protects the skyscape without wrecking the rest of the picture?</p>

			<p>I saw your McNamara (sp?) movie and I thought it was great, but I have to say that I have trouble working up some enthusiasm on these pieces.  I didn&#8217;t have the time to read them thoroughly and I question their value.  You showed us every inch of your research.  I guess if I were retired or was a archive photography scholar I would more value following all those details.  I&#8217;m just a working stiff.  Get to the point; connect the dots.  Truth is subjective and elusive.  I get it.  No other comment that has been posted seems to echo my impatience and I suspect I was not the only one who expressed such sentiments.  Are you taking critical &#8220;cannonballs&#8221; off the road?</p>

			<p>Every image is a fragment serving as an isolated symbol or cipher , until we vest them with meaning. Its  then they become another dot in the matrix of our consciousness. 1 or 0 , reality or fiction , a chicken or an egg.<br />
The quest for an absolute truth is an ancient an quixotic one . It has lead mathematicians into madness , spiritualists into caves and filmmakers to &#8216;  &#8216;The Valley of the Shadow of Death&#8217; . What do these seekers discover? they find zen paradoxes , infinite infinities and absolute universal truths that can be found nowhere.  Yet  they all point in the same direction and clues are uncovered between the reflections and  cracks of all the rocks on the road. While quantum physics shows us the further we peer into nature the more enigmatic she becomes. So mysterious that according to Heisenberg&#8217;s  &#8220;uncertainty theory&#8221; just  the mere act of observation changes the reality of what is observed. So never mind if Mr Fenton was tampering with Sontag&#8217;s reality , he was only doing to cannonballs with his arms what we&#8217;ve been doing to sub atomic particles with our eyes for time immemorial.<br />
Mr Morris asks rhetorically &#8220;how can the real world be recovered from the simulacrum?&#8221; . It can not . The simulacra  are the pixels  that compose our reality. It has been documented that some people born with severe visual impairment  believe themselves to have perfect vision. Until they are informed that their vision  is a distortion of the normal. Our senses lie to us all the time.  No matter how well a normal functioning eye works (and as an instrument the human eye is  superior to the most advanced optical network). Our perceptions are limited and a photograph is a limitation of a limitation. Though through these  lenses and images  we can discover a portal in the fragmented  and shattered shards of a dark looking glass and if we dare stare we may discover a deeper or simply more perverse truth of nature. What matters ultimately  is the stomach of the starer.<br />
Or as a German bloke once put it, &#8220;If thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee&#8221;</p>

			<p>There is a problem with photos being used as the only historical record of proceedings. With the first hand witnesses of WWI now almost all dying off a lot of the staged or demonstration photos taken around the same time are being mistaken for photos taken on the battlefield during combat.</p>
<p>I do take many photos myself, but find the technical fetishism of many photographers quite boring and only pretend to go along with it.</p>
<p>I do remember quite a lot of the details about my own photographs like where I was standing and how I was feeling at the time, so it is a pity more records do not exist for these particular photographs.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Right for the wrong reason&#8221; sounds far short of from being simply &#8220;right,&#8221; but people are disagreeing here based largely on their visual perception, from which we extract more meaning and information unconsciously than any of us are accustomed to thinking. Given that we spend our whole waking lives in witness of the effects of gravity, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if people could discern at a glance that what happened in between the two photos was sliding. We&#8217;re just I suspect everybody gets it right at a glance, and for the right (albeit unconscious) reason, and everything goes wonky from there. It&#8217;s impossible to argue for an intuition, except maybe with reference to more physiology than we or anybody is liable to know. The &#8220;reasons&#8221; in this case are stories, some more accurate than others to the events in Sebastopol, some more reflective than others of why the story teller believes what he or she believes.</p>

			<p>Forgive me if this has already been proposed by other commenters, but there may be an important alternate way of thinking about the setting that I feel is only implied in your posts&#8230;.what if Fenton arrived with the cannonballs littering the road?  Wanting to get through, he moves the shot off of the road.  Only after returning to, or deciding not to continue onward, he takes the OFF picture, and then decides for some reason (historic, artistic, ???) that it is important to show the original ON position.  That could be your missing or un-taken photograph, a third state of being, condition zero.</p>
<p>P.S. Have you talked to NYT about doing a video blog? It is always a joy to watch your video material.</p>

			<p>I cast my &#8220;huzzahs&#8221; for Ben Dougall, who did clearly figure it out back on Sept. 28, without the benefit of Dennis Purcell.  The simplicity of that &#8220;proof&#8221; is just great.  Isaac Newton to the rescue.</p>
<p>(Oh, and speaking of rocks, aside from the lack of an atmosphere for the dust fall-out, the moon is waterless.  The moon rocks brought back by Apollo lack evidence of hydrous igneous melts and chemical weathering.  Although radiometrically dated at billions of years old, the (non-brecciated) rocks are pristine without the chemical changes one would find associated with terrestrial rocks.)</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;ll never know the exact scene Fenton discovered as he walked to the site that day.  He may have &#8220;toyed&#8221; with any number of ON/OFF combinations prior, during and after the two frames we see here were exposed.  </p>

			<p>I know that your conclusion is correct, but the reasoning is faulty.  You are assuming too much here.   If we are to assume that one of the photo was staged, I don&#8217;t see why one would assume that the movement of the rocks in the foreground is not staged.  Rock can be kicked moved uphill just as Esmeralda was moved out of the picture.  Although the gravity doing the work is the most likely of the explanations, you cannot dare say they are conclusive.  Real conclusive evidence can be found in the shadows, which you gave up on too easily.  If you send me a email, I will send you my analysis, which is hard to describe in this comment section.</p>

			<p>I really like parallel that the statistic over-regularity of the rounded, manufactured balls on the flat road is an indicator of the photo order, while the statistically natural dislodging of organically-shaped rocks in the uneven hillside can tell us the same thing.</p>
<p>The jumble of the synthetic and natural in the war-side ditch furthers the dichotomy of posed versus &#8216;genuine&#8217; that lies toward the core of your essay. Just as posed can be true, all human action can be considered natural.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve read and thoroughly enjoyed this entire series.  I doubt anyone will read this and act on it, but while in a skeptical and examining frame of mind, I discovered a photograph on the New York Times Store web site titled &#8220;view from St. Regis Hotel, 1904.&#8221;  However, obvious landmarks include St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral and the Plant Mansion (now Cartier), which are on the opposite side of the street from the photographer.  The photo was in fact taken from the Gotham Hotel, which was built in 1905.</p>

			<p>With so many variables and unknowns surrounding these two photos, how could any conclusions be considered as &#8216;definitive&#8217;? And as others commenters have said, Mr. Purcell&#8217;s observed rocks could have been bounced by close, incoming cannon fire. The rocks wouldn&#8217;t necessarily move in the direction of gravity in such a case. The same is true had they been kicked out of place. But we know nothing about what took place between the taking of the two photos besides what Mr. Fenton decided to mention in his letter. And there is the issue of the tools used to view and analyze the photos: Web  browsers, Photoshop and other digital computer software. These photos may present physical evidence, but there are so many factors involved in  seeing and analyzing that evidence that it still becomes a subjective set of judgements to interpret what that evidence might say. No one even 25 years ago would have had such tools at their disposal. They hadn&#8217;t been created yet. So these conclusions are time-and-tool specific, not eternal, and not even very durable. Mr. Purcell was at least the 3rd of a set of &#8216;experts&#8217; who attempted to solve your binary riddle of before and after. Social exercises beget social truths: group consensus is generally what holds sway in democratically-oriented societies. Any jury, or any set of twelve commenters here would have great difficulty reaching a consensus about the order in which these photos were taken, or why they were or weren&#8217;t taken in that order. In a king&#8217;s court, what he said about a matter was the truth, the evidence be damned. That made life easier, but not necessarily more fair. In your exercise the meatier issues of Sontag&#8217;s wider point, whether Mr. Fenton was a coward, or photo faker, and how the commenters here felt about the two photos in general were left to get embroidered around the edges of the techical issues, the discourses on Russian history, cameras, etc. This exercise has been like going to the hardware store to find out what Plato thought about Julia Child&#8217;s cookbooks. The clerk at the hardware store is certain that you are crazy (something you admit to being) for asking it, and even though he isn&#8217;t as smart as you are by half, he is still correct in his assessment.</p>

			<p>Mr. Morris, your three essays have been very enjoyable reads. I read the first soon after it was in the NYT but didn&#8217;t get to the 2nd &amp; 3rd till now (May 2008). The final solution from Purcell is indeed very  solid and difficult to refute. In any case, now that we know the order of the photos, you are correct to note that the intent of the photos and the possibility of moving canon balls off and on is still unknown. Still &#8211; a fun exercise and thank you for taking us on this journey. Best, Vishakha</p>

			<p>I enjoyed the article immensely. The ending was extremely satisfying, especially since after part two, I assumed that there would be no solution to the problem of the order of the photos.</p>
<p>A bit of a tangent: You mention a &#8220;gedanken experiment&#8221; in part three of your article. Has anyone realized that this is a very bad name for that concept? How can thinking about something be considered an experiment? Shouldn&#8217;t an experiment involve testing a hypothesis in the real world?</p>
<p>I understand that so-called &#8216;thought experiments&#8217; have been important to the history of science. But, really, come on. That does not make them experiments, does it?</p>

			<p>I just finished the article 2 years late and realized something. This may have been addressed in one of the other comments but here it goes. The harvesting of balls by British soldiers might have taken place in between the taking of the two pictures. The reason why they were placed on the road so evenly was because the soldiers were sorting them and placing them in a neat pattern by size or by quality. It occurs to me that the British soldiers might have only wanted certain canon balls that would fit their canons, or perhaps, ones that were not so damaged that they can&#8217;t be used. Many of the balls in ON look to be different sizes and very round, being in good condition. I&#8217;ve often discovered, that there are always reasons for things that we just don&#8217;t know and can&#8217;t imagine because there directives &#038; reasons that only pertain to that particular event and would not apply now. It is possible that Fenton took picture one OFF and the soldiers came and harvested their canon ball, putting them in there sorted pattern on the road, and then he took his second picture ON, and had no part in altering the composition for artistic effect. As a large format photographer who practices 19th century photographic processes, I know how daunting it is to lug around heavy equipment and get set up. The last thing I would have wanted to do was to pick up heavy canon balls and place them on the road. Just a thought</p>

			<p>I very much enjoyed reading this article after stumbling upon these photos at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>One mystery I wonder about in these photographs is why on [ON] are there more cannonballs than in [OFF]?  If the photo is indeed staged and came after [OFF], where did all the extra cannonballs come from?  It would have made significantly more sense to use the balls available at hand, that is in the gullies, to place on the road than try to acquire balls from somewhere else to place, especially since many of the balls in the gully that we see have not moved.</p>
<p>Is it out of the question to think that he may have been shelled between the first picture and the second?  Otherwise all those balls would have had to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Very interesting!  In the long run, I agree that Fenton wasn&#8217;t a coward and probably did not &#8211; if he indeed DID &#8211; pose the [ON] photograph for the purpose of pure sensationalism.  Not that the Victorians didn&#8217;t sensationalize, on the contrary, they loved it.  But from your evidence we see that he really didn&#8217;t try to capitalize on the sensationalist aspect.  Indeed, none of his other photos seem to be sensationalist, why this one?</p>
<p>Overall very interesting read.  I still think the issue is not closed despite your very strong evidence!</p>

			<p>So, let us speculate&#8230;&#8230;<br />
if the cannonballs were as thick as they appear on the ground, why would they NOT have landed on the road?<br />
if you were a soldier and you had to go there w/some crazy photographer AND you had to grab cannonballs on the way, which cannonballs would you grab?<br />
if you had already seen cannonballs bouncing about, and you could see that cannonballs were so thick that they made walking difficult, would you hang around to move cannonballs back and forth or would you go in, get the picture, wait just long enough so that the cannonballs you could grab fast were loaded and then get out?</p>
