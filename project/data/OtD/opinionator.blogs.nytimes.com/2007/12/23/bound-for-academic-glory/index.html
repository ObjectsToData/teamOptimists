						<div class="entry-content"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The preliminary report of the New York State Commission on Higher Education (established earlier this year by Governor Spitzer in an Executive Order ) <a href="http://www.hecommission.state.ny.us/" target="new">has now been issued</a>, and in many ways it is a remarkable and commendably ambitious document. It is also very badly written, although it must be acknowledged that the nature of these reports – part cheerleading, part politicking, part policy making – pretty much ensures that the prose will be less than elegant. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In this case the bad writing takes two forms. First, there are the sentences made up of empty abstractions linked together in an awkward and strained syntax: “The goal is to magnetize lost talent and ensure that students thrive and progress, in order to create new generations of innovators who will enable New York State to continue as one of the world’s idea capitals.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And there are the sentences that actually say something, but in a prose so clotted and bureaucratic that it takes several readings to figure out what it is: “&#8230; the Commission recommends campuses focus on the major transfer pathways, such that by the start of the 2010-11 academic year, articulation agreements are in place that specify how every comparable lower-division course can be transferred for credit, as prerequisite for more advanced courses in parallel programs and counted toward baccalaureate degree requirements at receiving institutions within the system.”<br />
<span id="more-2505"></span><br />
But once you get past the style (I can not resist noting one use of “lagged” as a transitive verb), there is more than a little substance and it is presented with an unusual candor: “There is troubling evidence that the State has slipped in stature over the past twenty years.” Responsibility for this slippage (not quite the right word; the New York higher education system has never had much stature in the first place) is distributed among several constituencies, including the legislature (“Too little revenue has forced campuses to compromise academic quality”), the central administration (“Over-regulation pervades every aspect of SUNY’s operation” ) and the Board of Regents  (“&#8230;the Commission has concluded that further devolution of responsibility for day to day affairs to the &#8230;individual campuses&#8230; will likely enhance performance and achievement”). </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The conclusion is straightforward and simple: &#8220;too little revenue, too little investment, and too much regulation.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is by no means a unique situation. In 2002 , Mark Yudoff, then president of the University of Minnesota, wrote an essay titled “Is the Public Research University Dead?” His main point was that the historic compact between state governments and public universities – we’ll support you with revenues in return for low tuition and broad access – has been broken: “&#8230;over the past 25 years , that agreement has withered, leaving public research institutions in a purgatory of insufficient resources and declining competitiveness.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Declining competitiveness” means declining ability to compete with private institutions that certainly have their problems but are in general more in control of their funding and less hemmed in by burdensome regulations. As many have observed, the gap in resources between the publics and the privates is steadily increasing, and we seem to be moving to a two-tier system of higher education.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is not true of the public institutions to whose status New York and other states aspire – UC Berkeley, UCLA, the University of Michigan, the University of Virginia. These state universities, and a few others, enjoy the luxury of decades and even centuries of support. Generations of faithful alumni have established special funds that sustain programs that might otherwise be cut. More often than not a good number of the loyal alumni populate the state legislature and are  devoted to their alma mater’s athletic teams, a devotion many ordinary citizens share. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">None of this is true of the New York system, which is both huge (64 institutions) and young (dating from the mid-&#8217;60s). That youth does not insulate it from infra-structure problems.  Many 40-year-old buildings that have not been properly maintained are in various states of decay (I saw this problem at the University of Illinois at Chicago, also of mid-&#8217;60s vintage), and the cost of what is euphemistically called  “deferred maintenance” is estimated by the report to be in excess of $5 billlion, and growing every day.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Not a pretty picture. Declining academic quality, a “deterioration of the state’s share of national academic research and development dollars”; a low percentage (relative to a national average) of full-time faculty members, inadequate (and again below average) stipends for graduate students, no low cost student loans, crumbling facilities, crippling oversight, political interference (implied, not stated).  In short, a big, wealthy, powerful state with a public higher education system that is middling at best and less prestigious than the systems of  smaller, poorer states (Wisconsin, Iowa, Georgia, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Indiana, to name a few).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the remedy? Money &#8212; a lot of it. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In addition to the $5 billion for deferred maintenance, the Commission calls for a $3 billion research fund, 4,000 additional graduate students supported by competitive stipends, and 2,000 new faculty, recruited from out of state and including 250 academic superstars. The bill will be astronomical, and even higher than the Commission thinks. A significant number of the new hires will be scientists who will require a “start up” package (laboratory space and special equipment). The report relies on 5-year-old statistics that put the price tag at “$300,000 for an assistant professor in biology professor to nearly a million dollars for a senior chemistry professor.” But those figures are low even by 2002 standards: $800,000 might get you a really promising assistant professor and a senior researcher will cost anywhere from $2 million to infinity.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Two questions: Could it work, and will it be attempted? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It might work if it is sustained, a word the Commission’s report quite properly emphasizes. Any number of institutions, public and private, have attempted to raise their status and move into the category of “world-class” institutions, a status the Commission believes can be attained by the universities at Buffalo, Stony Brook, Albany and Binghamton (which would be the main beneficiaries of the report’s proposals). </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But in almost every case, after a few years of enhanced revenues the legislature’s attention turns elsewhere, and those who have been lured by the promise of massive transformation depart for the next state on the make. If, this time, the governor and the legislature were to sign on to the long-range plan of support outlined in the report, everyone in the academy would be paying attention and many would be thinking, <em>Well, something good may be going on there</em>. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But where would you get 2,000 new faculty members? Given that the scholars you would be going after are productive and well-regarded (if they weren’t, there would be no point in wooing them), what you can count on is 2,000 bidding wars. And as for 250 academic superstars (not a term the report uses), there just aren’t 250 academic superstars, unless you engage in a form of grade inflation. But if the system managed to attract even 50 of this rare breed, it would make the right kind of news.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So, yes, it could possibly work, although probably not to the extent of having Buffalo,  Stonybrook, Albany and Binghamton join Berkeley and Michigan at the top of the heap. Will New York try it? That is a political question, and more than a local one. The decline in state support for higher education noted by Yudoff is in part a legacy of the 60&#8217;s. I remember as a fledgling member of the Berkeley faculty in 1962 being given special treatment by merchants. The university, known as Cal, was a source of community pride. Three years later , after the Free Speech movement and a wave of student protests across the country, I had to be careful not to identify myself as a university employee. The middle-class reaction to left politics on campus had already set in, and in the decades that followed it has become an orthodoxy.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Commission says nothing about this public relations problem, but appeals instead to state pride. “Every idea entertained,” the report says, “was tested with a simple question: How does this compare with other states?” More often than not, the answer was distressing, and the Commission is counting on New Yorkers to ask, <em>Are we satisfied with a system of higher education that doesn’t match up to what those other guys have?</em> Of course, the answer may be “yes,” and if it is, the report of an official commission, bold and comprehensive though it may be, will end up being little more than a footnote in history.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But even if, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, the Commission’s proposals are implemented, the benefits will not be evenly distributed. In his 2002 essay, Yudoff observed that a university might succeed in competing in the academic market, but still lose hold of what makes it what it is: “&#8230; to remain a great learning institution, it will have to continue to nurture learning for its own sake&#8230; and foster other less quantifiable and profitable – but still valuable – features of the university.” There’s nothing like that in the report. All the emphasis is on science, partnerships with industry and advances in technology. If there is to be a brave new world in New York higher education, it doesn’t look as if the humanities and the arts will be a significant part of it.  </p>

			<p>Where do people get this cockamamie idea that &#8220;having your ticket punched by an elite school is almost a requirement to enter the higher levels of American society&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Hogwash.  In a few big law firms or brokerages that may be so, but the boards and upper tiers of mangement of Fortune 500 companies are not stocked exclusively &#8211; or even particularly heavily &#8211; with the ultra-bright, ultra-educated children of the ultra-rich.  </p>

			<p>It is the posters, and not Professor Fish, who are obsessed with grammar. Fish is slyly telling us something about the Report itself: that a report on higher education does not seem to have been written by highly educated folks. </p>
<p>His opening remarks tie in nicely with his concluding paragraph about disregard for the arts.</p>
<p>A New Yorker cartoon of several decades ago said it rather well. An operator with earphones is answering a bank of telephones. She says, &#8220;Borda<br />

			<p>Milorad&#8217;s comments are as offensive as they are absurd. I taught at a SUNY institution for 12 years. Every degree I hold&#8211;B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.&#8211;is from a state university. I left for many of the reasons cited here, but for another state university.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at SUNY Albany, where I taught, I had good and bad students just like everywhere. And the good students were spectacular&#8211;the lacrosse player (Albany had a very good team) with a 4.0 average; the young lady with similar scores who studied in the UK after graduating, and, I hope, a student I can recruit to my PhD program. The program in which I taught was a top-10 program. Other strengths are evident throughout SUNY&#8211;engineering at Buffalo, sciences as Stony Brook (two words, Dr. Fish), the liberal arts at New Paltz, Binghamton, and Geneseo, the arts at Purchase, and so on. The system could be far better, of course, and perhaps there are moves to make this happen after over eight years of neglect (and sometimes hostility) under Pataki.</p>
<p>All of this happened in spite of the shackles placed on our campus and all the others by the unbelievable layers of bureaucracy, starting in SUNY Central, and running all the way through the institution. Then there&#8217;s the legislature&#8217;s continued insistence on treating the 63 physical campuses of the system as some sort of local pork; it&#8217;s easier to close a military base than it is to cut back a superfluous or underperforming campus or program. </p>
<p>New York will never have a system on par with Iowa, Wisconsin, Kansas, etc., until it makes the decision to actually invest in the system, and until the people of New York State realize that SUNY schools are, in many cases, fine institutions, not just safety schools for indolent students. Looks like SUNY has some explaining to do.</p>
<p>Finally, no New York taxpayer&#8211;or taxpayers in most other states&#8211;need feel unduly burdened by the costs of state support for the university system.</p>

			<p>Its always nice to see public school-private school snobbery on the pages of the Times.  Sorry we poor saps that went to such lousy institutions as public universities waste our time reading your newspaper.</p>
<p>A more relevant question is what is the goal of these universities, particularly in the humanities?  Given that one of the key roles of a major research university is the training of new PhDs, what point is there in a major expansion of these universities if job prospects remain so poor for new PhDs?  This is a problem that exists in the sciences as well.</p>
<p>Sorry if many in the public decline to act as an unthinking slot machine for academics who have a highly inflated sense of self-worth to society.</p>

			<p>Dr. Fish&#8217;s analysis hit Wisconsin just as hard as New York.  Less and less money, a drive to &#8220;community service&#8221; (read corporate training ground)and fear of those disciplines that make students examine the cultural boxes in which they live (read &#8220;those leftist humanities).  </p>
<p>I am amused by the comments attacking Dr. Fish&#8217;s grammar lessons.  As many writers and social thinkers (those humanities again) have pointed out, willingness to accept sloppy, inaccurate language shows a culture losing its ability to think clearly.  Read George Orwell.  Then look around at the messages being delivered by current politicians (oops.  Leftist thought)</p>
<p>What Dr. Fish or the report did not address, however, is the social/cultural context in which research universities now exist.  National Adult literacy statistics, the National Endowment for the Arts and other agencies all show a declining literacy rate and declining interest in literacy nation-wide and through all age groups. </p>
<p>Socially, at least in the public university where I work, a critical mass of students and their parents see education as value only insofar as it adds value to work.  At the same time, the social safety net such as health insurance and Federal/State financial aid,has internal rules that affect students&#8217; abilities to work and go to school part time</p>
<p>Taken together, social attitudes and the structures in which students must operate affect their abilties to do well..and reflect the increased view that edcuation is simply a collection of stuff and NOT transformational&#8230;and that transformation is not worth the effort or cost.</p>
<p>Finally, the post that suggested that the billions spent on war affect education has it right&#8230;but misses the most important issue:  there is little outcry against these priorities and decreasing interest in thinking through the &#8220;swindling language&#8221; (Dr. Fish&#8217;s concern about grammar) used by the politicians to sell their actions.</p>

			<p>For those interested in this issue/set of issues I would suggest a documentary produced for PBS a few years ago, _Declining by Degrees_.  You probably get the double entendre (though there are some redeeming moments for higher education there, too).</p>

			<p>I am commenting from the third dimension on this. State universities are appropriate for student-individuals who want to make their lifes in their surroundings and have not too many intellectual ambitions. Whatever faculty goes there is old enough to know what they are doing, unfortunately many believe that they are &#8220;internationally known and reknown&#8221; experts in their fields, their perception of their reputation and capacities is way beyond a realistic level. Hiring so-called elite faculty is not a solution because this is a second tier kind of elite who will accept such a calling: those who are not contributing to the major streams or hotspots of research in their fields. And students are not totally dumb, they observe and learn. I took a graduate level marketing class with a so-called &#8216;elite&#8217; researcher &#8211; did he insist on the standing of his department nationally &#8211; and all of my student-colleague where very doubtful about the accuracy and usefulness of what was taught. Not long thereafter a study came out that showed that companies led by marketing gurus fare worse than companies led by other MBA specialists. Besides, who wants to sit in a class and have the prof lean back and declare that marketing always disadvantages the poor and women?!<br />
There are fields that are perhaps not worth funding after all, at least at a state school level. If they do marketing, than it should be done in a fashion that is more than memorizing the instructor&#8217;s notes and learning his world view as though it were a respected theory.<br />
other &#8220;elite&#8221; faculty just does not train. If professors were paid by how well they place their graduates, the academic world would truly change. But there are all these excellently fishy excuses out there, some of them that women don&#8217;t pursue a career after graduation, that students are no longer what they used to be. Laziness is a very big factor.<br />
Paying a professor by the type of placement of his/her students would finally shed light into the medieval darkness of academics. And many state departments in many fields would have to close down or eliminate their graduate programs for the extremely poor performance they show and have gotten away with for decades.<br />
So who will teach America&#8217;s undergrads at state schools and below in 50 years? Young professionals from Africa, for they still don&#8217;t mind or can&#8217;t help being pulled over the table, or graduates from Ivy Schools who may or may not be competent but definitely like the freedom that comes with the paycheck. The rest of the world, including parents, has long noticed that something is foul in the state of Liberty.<br />
Is it just a question of funding? Definitely not. It is a question of how networks are set up &#8211; the eternal preference of ivy league graduates on the job market, even when they underperform miserably on the job; of professors not being required to teach courses in core areas; of curriculums being made a ridicule because professors prefer to teach they way they have done for the past four decades. In sum, it it the complete disconnecting with any type of evaluative reality outside of the individual academic institution. State schools train all the way past the market, past any type of reality.</p>

			<p>What is the sense of teaching and producing graduates in fields like &#8220;Francophone literature&#8221; or &#8220;Gay and Lesbian studies&#8221;? Does anyone have an idea how incompetent these future teachers that are currently being so inadequately trained will be?! Well, I do. I had to sit next in class to them, so I know how little they know, I know how little competent they are even beyond the overnarrow focus of their interests. I don&#8217;t think that any humanities has any future in the US and this is the fault of the faculty in these departments more than anything else, the fault of university management that does not allow cross-disciplinary engagement at any level other than the faculty member level &#8211; and there all too often that research results in something that no department or field involved would recognize as their own. And it is above all a blatant statement on what getting an education in the US means: a question of money and nothing else.<br />
One cannot consider a graduate training at a state school as being equivalent to graduate training at a private university. It is not and will never be if the system does not change. It is a lie when professors say that graduate students between state schools and private schools do not differ. there is an entire world of differences between them.<br />
State schools exploit graduate students on more than one level: the system sells itself as open &#8220;only the sky is the ceiling&#8221; while it remains very very discriminatory on the basis of graduating institution, they underpay graduate students and they offer a most lousy training in exchange.<br />
And please do not believe that elsewhere in the world people don&#8217;t know about this. And no, it is not the same elsewhere &#8211; in Europe in many countries there are only state schools, no private universities. The difference is that far fewer PhD holders become professors than in the US and that the brightest sit in one class along with the dumbest and who succeeds is a matter of who knows how to get through the system. Does it never strike you that the students who come here from Europe attended largely only state school and they are still a hundred times more skilled in their fields than american students?<br />
these discussions about financing are pointless. as long as the faculty does not want to change, nothing will change except perhaps the size of the paycheck.</p>

			<p>I taught at private, ivy and public universities during graduate studies. I came out of it knowing that I would never teach at a public university. My experiences still fill me with bad aftertastes and disgust with having been exposed to this type of environment. Unlike privately funded universities, state schools seem to admit literally everyone. I have heard a bunch of blatant lies from students why they could not stand up in time in the morning to come to class and still deserve As despite not having done homework for 2 and half months, I have been exposed to discriminating jokes, I have been exposed to all types of treatments noone ever experiences at a privately funded university. I have had the most stupid colleagues I could ever have imagined, who on top of that got very aggressive against the professor if they did not un derstand the subject matter, which happened more often than you would guess. State universities in the US are a joke. And I agree with the opinion that there is not much of a place for humanities in the future. Already now there is no place for fields such as literature. And one cannot blame lack of financing. In this world a field that has as its sole object written texts is bound to fail and to attract only those most feeble-minded. We are no longer societies that rely on the command of forms of different texts. Most if not all humanities fields are really just good for training teachers and nothing else. And research in these fields is not interesting at all to those equipped with a more balanced set of skills.<br />
If you add to this the prevalent favoritism that is practiced &#8211; quite strongly in contrast to fields where people really have to perform to be successfull &#8211; humanities comes off as a mud ground. I witnessed favoritism that really should be called public discrimination and that still went on unabashedly and continues to today. what message are these fields sending about themselves? I think enough people have managed to read it.</p>

			<p>Scott Banks said: &#8220;It was only after a 1978 initiative called Proposition 13 began first to drain local and then state coffers that universities were impacted and fees began to rise in our state, but that had nothing to do with animosity against liberal campuses. Prop. 13 was a conservative anti-tax measure that impacted public services across the board. To this day, wealthy bedroom communities across California struggle to finance simple things like the filling of potholes, and can only do so with state aid.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A Midwestern, middleclass, state school grad, with a professional degree writes:<br />
In the previous posts, many have commented that the level of humanities education is lacking, especially in state universities.  This is yet another symptom of our ailing American education system.<br />
Is the average university student going to pick his or her field of study altruistically?  Is this student more likely to select Latin or Engineering as a major/career?  Which career paths garner the highest wages?  Schools market themselves to prospective students based on the marketability of their diplomas.  The state of our education system helps to expose our societal values and the stark reality of having to make a living after college.  </p>
<p>If one thinks that state universities are populated with lousy, drunken, partially-illiterate students, I challenge one to look a little harder!<br />
Can one be so blind?  There are MANY brilliant students at state universities!   While there are my great state students, there are many systemic problems.  State universities and all other forms of public education should be upheld as a cornerstone of our democratically inclined nation.  After all, is not an educated electorate a democratic necessity?   Let’s increase our education standards, use our precious money with more efficiency, publicly fund our public universities, and learn for learning’s sake…in a perfect world…</p>

			<p>&#8220;Finally, no New York taxpayer–or taxpayers in most other states–need feel unduly burdened by the costs of state support for the university system. </p>
<p>— Posted by Tom in Raleigh&#8221; </p>
<p>Without casting aspersions on either the students, or the faculty at SUNY, I think there&#8217;s a central question here hasn&#8217;t been asked, and which I want to ask as a New York taxpayer &#8212; should we, in fact, have a state university system in New York?  If it will cost billions to upgrade, can New York, and New York&#8217;s citizens afford it given the other competing budgetary issues?  Would we be better off giving vouchers to students to attend private institutions in NY, or public institutions elsewhere (if a basic education is the objective) or research grants to research institutions (if that is the objective)?  If we need a state university, do we need more than the 4 mentioned campuses?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not trying to come across as anti-education or against the democratic ideal.<br />
Saying that we may not be able to afford SUNY as currently constituted (or as recommended by th Spitzer report) isn&#8217;t, in fact, saying the same thing as &#8220;we hate public universities,&#8221; but it may be the same thing as admitting that other states, and other jurisdictions, may do a better job of education than we do, and that there really may be better options for us to investigate.</p>

			<p>The story of support and quality is much more complicated that presented in Fish&#8217;s commentary.  I write as a proud recipient of public education: kindergarten through PhD. and a faculty member for 20 years at an ivy league university.  Explaining the distress of public higher education requires a more nuanced political and institutional analysis than Fish provides.  When I graduated from SUNY-Albany, nearly 10 years after the Free Speech Movement, tuition was waived for Regents Scholars and nominal for everyone else.  CUNY tuition was still free. Given the rapidity of legislative action, there was more than enough time for negative reaction to the student movements of the 60&#8242;s to effect funding. </p>
<p>The real declines in support began later.  Like all other public services since the Reagan revolution, public universities, especially the young, non-land grant systems such as SUNY, are suffering from divestment of tax revenues and general demeaning of all public institutions.  This is particularly hurtful when, at the same time private institutions are currying tax-deductible donations from their affluent alums and watching their endowments swell in the exuberant investment markets.  Private institutions are capable of using these resources to bid up the price on star faculty and provide amenities that add to the impression that they are worth mortgaging the family home to attend.  Public universities, late comers to the donations game, are on a steep learning curve &#8212; one that I have had the opportunity to witness as I advise my own alma mater on its new fund raising initiatives.  </p>
<p>The truly excellent public research universities, such as Michigan, are suffering not only from diminished state support but also from the loss of the federal research dollars, which helped to support infrastructure as well operations.  </p>
<p>The support and quality of institutions of public higher education will only improve when their  constituencies see research and education as crucial to the economic future of their state and themselves. Until then, detractors should be reminded that nearly every  K-12 school teacher and a vast percentage of doctors and engineers, are now educated in public institutions &#8212; so even if they never attend, they are benefitiing from their investment.</p>

			<p>So the enlightened geniuses of this board can&#8217;t stand the smell of public schools?  I guess that means that a public school like the City College, which for generations has offered a college education to immigrants and first-generation university students.  Sorry that doesn&#8217;t meet your exacting requirements.</p>
<p>Sorry also that many people in this country would like to make a living for their families and perhaps don&#8217;t have the full time necessary to devote to meaningless &#8220;core curriculum&#8221; courses that are foisted on students by so-called academics.</p>
<p>I have an Ivy League grad degree and (proudly) a state university for a BA.  Sure there&#8217;s a difference&#8211;and there should be when the Ivy school has an endowment of 20billion dollars or more.  </p>
<p>Comparing a US state university like a SUNY or a Michigan to any European university (other than Oxbridge or Grandes Ecoles) makes the Europeans look rather shabby.   That is an overworked and underperforming system.</p>

			<p>No surprise. The surprise is that some educators (like Mr. Fish) are finally catching on. Read The Civilization of Illiteracy (begun 1982, published 1998 &#8211; No one wanted to accept its insights). However, in it you will find a practical justification for the arts and humanities (underline &#8220;practical,&#8221; which is the only acceptable qualifier in today&#8217;s economy). Eventually, the educational system will stop its evolution towards yet another business enterprise based on the industrial model, producing homogenous products to fit a desire imposed by consumerism, and start educating the individual. An expensive proposition, and no way to &#8220;test&#8221; for positive outcome. Individual fulfillment is hard to measure, but individual contribution is not. The results are only longer in bearing fruit. Or not: Consider Google, Apple, Microsoft. Their founders left higher education not because of the lack of arts &amp; humanities, but because something else was missing.</p>

			<p>Whatever the causes, it&#8217;s too late. When one can read on the NYT website appalling reader statements such as &#8220;when a poet creates a vaccine or a tangible good that can be produced by a Fortune 500 company blablablah&#8221;, which to me definitely rates quite close to the ultimate in western materialistic decadent moronic thought, there is no more doubt that our civilization is doomed.

			<p>Benefactors once balanced the excesses of wealth with support of the arts and humanities because the arts and humanities had a clear mission: social critique, healing, and visualization of the future. Even governments believed this.  This is how mass education came to be funded by taxpayers in the first place. Judging from the quotes in Fish&#8217;s essay, status consciousness has replaced sustainability with the result that we have a broken culture that will take decades to mend.   </p>
<p>Give me a modest, little, out-of-the-way college that soars under the radar over bloated land-grant shock factories. Some of the best teachers in the country are found in small colleges and, though few even know of their existence, sustainablity has been achieved for all of the right reasons.</p>

			<p>Regarding #45, David Berman  You say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our reluctance to fund public higher education is but the older brother of our failure to fund lower education, cousin to our failure to fund the arts and our withdrawal of funding from basic science, all of which phenomena are children of the anti-intellectualism that has become the dominant characteristic of American culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>You end your comment with the plea that the people (anti-intellectual as they supposedly are) invest  in the intellectual enterprise.  </p>
<p>If the people are as anti-intellectual as you suggest, then it is difficult to imagine why they would take your advice and spend more money on education.  After all, most of the tax payers are finished with school and won&#8217;t be enlightened themselves as a result of more tax money spent on education.  </p>
<p>The pair of ideas (anti-intellectual Americans spending more money on education) are mutually exclusive, are they not?</p>
<p>It looks like most Americans do, in fact, support intellectual capital improvement spending.  The minority who do not are either troglodytes or very well educated manipulators of the people.  About the troglodytes, nothing need be said.  But for the puppeteers:  their purposes tend toward depriving the people of the intellectual capacity to cut the chains by which we are jerked around.  </p>

			<p>The problem is that university&#8217;s spend a disproportionate share of thier income building new facilities to attract new grants and to give thier professors research to make the university more prestigious.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the declining public support is because tuition raises are far outstripping inflation but every year we hear about these poor universities that can&#8217;t make ends meet.  Tell me if you keep raising tuition rates at 2 and 3 times the rate of inflation, why would anyone think you need more funding?</p>

			<p>Professor Fish writes that while the Humanities fosters critical thinking, so does cable news and sports radio.  Since the humanities does not have an exclusive claim to critical thinking, it cannot be justified on that basis.</p>
<p>I think that one cannot infer from a lack of exclusive claim, a lack of justification.  While logical reasoning is necessary for cable news, the humanities (and for that matter newspapers) requires more in depth, rigorous, and demanding reasoning.  I assumed this is why Humanities Professors, like Professor Fish, write columns addressing a wide variety of issues that fall outside the analysis of a poem or discussion of humanities departments.  </p>
<p>     Humanities Professors contribution is difficult to perceive because we lack public intellectuals more so today than ever before.  But in the 19th century, the poet and professor Ralph Waldo Emerson, helped to define the spirit of his day.  So too did philosopher John Dewey greatly set the tone and spirit for the progressive political movements of the early 20th century. </p>
<p>I think too the Professor Fish places to much emphasis on English and forgets that history, philosophy, and perhaps political theory are also humanities subjects.  While most citizens do not read these difficult texts, they nonetheless greatly influence culture changing forever who we are and what we will do.  For example, Ulrich B. Philips work on slavery convince Americans, including President Woodrow Wilson, that slavery was a benign institution.  It was not the 1950s that history professors, such as Kenneth B. Stammp, published work greatly demonstrating the horrors of slavery.  Though few read Stammp, through cultural intermediaries, such as journalists, his message became a part of our culture and our image of slavery and America was forever changed.     </p>
<p>And while a sports show may foster critical thinking, its subject is sports, while the humanities is culture.  Questioning the underlying premises of our culture I believe is much more threatening, revealing, and illuminating the questioning underlying premise of sports strategies or scores.  I love sports, but my critical thinking faculties are more greatly exercised in a humanities class, or reading NY Review of books than reading the sports section of the newspaper.</p>

			<p>Let me respectfully disagree with Professor Fish&#8217;s remedy to the ills of the higher educational system in New York (or anywhere):</p>
<p>&#8220;And the remedy? Money — a lot of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Money is often useful, and heaven knows that worldwide we spend far too much on wasteful and unproductive activities and far too little on productive activities such as sound educational systems.</p>
<p>However, a lot of good can be done with quite little money indeed.  I&#8217;d suggest educators should look at the seminal works of John N. Warfield to understand my claims &#8211; check out <a href="http://www.jnwarfield.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jnwarfield.com</a> &#8211; and then look at a development from Warfield&#8217;s work that I call the &#8216;One Page Management System&#8217; (OPMS).  To those who will write in to me at <a href="mailto:gs_chandy@yahoo.com">gs_chandy@yahoo.com</a>, I shall be happy to send PowerPoint presentation and other documentation that could help convince of my claims.  Should you be interested enough or just intrigued by my claims, let me know and I shall be happy to make freely available to you the software that enables you to create models to represent the &#8216;systems&#8217; that you need to create to accomplish any feasible Mission &#8211; along with some (limited) guidance.</p>

			<p>Call me naive or ill informed, but last I recall, the major societies of the ancient worlds that focused more on the arts and humanities lasted by far longer than we have. I myself being an artist, my viewpoint is going to be a little biased, but nonetheless, I feel as if there isn&#8217;t any reason why any part of education should be slighted just because it is viewed as being less important.</p>
<p>An artist in my area uses his talents to help save animals who otherwise would have no home, and let&#8217;s not forget the sketch artists of the police force who help criminals be identified and caught. Individuals who learn to play an instrument are shown to learn more readily and more fully than those who do not. Former dancers tend to do better in any job that requires physical fitness.</p>
<p>Personally, if the arts and humanities are going to be given less funding, I propose that sports programs be given the same treatment. After all, &#8220;when a quuarterback creates a vaccine or a tangible good that can be produced by a Fortune 500 company, I’ll rescind my comment.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Milorad B., your comment indicates a scary set of assumptions about state university students. If you&#8217;ve met so many uneducated-seeming graduates of these institutions, it must be because you&#8217;re going to local bars. Their hardworking classmates are getting a night of rest for work the next day, while thousands of students like them work into the night at their alma maters&#8217; libraries.</p>
<p>I attend the University of Cincinnati, hardly a world-class institution, from which I&#8217;ll graduate in June with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in English, summa cum laude, with distinguished honors status. Four years I will have spent writing papers for courses taught by Ivy League graduates, and now spending sixty hours weekly completing a thesis project and learning literary theory. Come next year, I will be lucky to be accepted into NYU or similar state schools; I am not even going to waste the application fees on the Ivies.<br />
Why is this? It&#8217;s because of the one single blemish on my resume, the name of the school I attended. Yes, thousands &#8220;goof off&#8221; at these modest state universities (just as they do, as you point out, in the Ivy League). The rest are barred from the more prestigious graduate programs because everyone assumes that they are drunk.</p>
<p>Attitudes like yours, Milorad B., maintain a classist rift (I&#8217;m beginning to wonder what university you attended, and who paid for it), a rift that makes it impossible for state universities to truly improve. So you&#8217;re right: with such an unshakable status quo, why pay taxes to fight it?</p>
