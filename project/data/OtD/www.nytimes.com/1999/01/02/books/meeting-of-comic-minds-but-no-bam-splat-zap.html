He raised the other.</p><p>Across the room, a younger man with red eyes, a turquoise mohawk and eyebrows scarred from having too many rings drilled into them pondered the comic book thoughts he has whenever he walks through a door. ''The thing I find myself thinking is, 'Now I'm going to go through that door.' Is that the Captain America in me speaking or my own comic brain?''</p><p>It was just another academic gathering, a recent conference at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first graphic novel. At the opening reception the comics groupies were out in force. There was a buffet with two kinds of fried chicken, warmed-over spanakopita, raw vegetables with French onion-soup dip and unforgiving fluorescent lights.</p><p>The guest of honor had no body piercings and no sweatshirt. He was Will Eisner, the 82-year-old creator of the comic book hero ''The Spirit'' and the author of ''A Contract With God,'' the first graphic novel, written in 1978.</p>                </div>

                    <p>For anyone who does not know, a graphic novel is a serious literary work in comic book form, like Art Spiegelman's ''Maus'' or Jules Feiffer's ''Tantrum.'' If comics are ''those bright, colorful magazines filled with bad art, stupid stories and guys in tights,'' as Scott McCloud jokingly put it in his book ''Understanding Comics'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1993), then graphic novels are their earnest offspring. The tights are gone, the stories are often grim, and the drawing . . . well, it isn't exactly comic.</p><p>During the conference Mr. Eisner traced his own path through comics, from strips to books to underground comics to graphic novels. In the depths of the Great Depression, he said, newspaper comic strips were so popular that pulp publishers started selling comics in magazine form, as comic books. Soon there wasn't enough material to fill them. Mr. Eisner started a company with his friend Jerry Iger to produce new material. He worked with Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, before Batman was born. Mr. Eisner created his own hero, the Spirit, a masked, gloved dead man with no special powers. But Mr. Eisner's heart was in reality.</p><p>Paradoxically, it was censorship that finally opened the door to literary comic books. In 1954 ''The Seduction of the Innocent,'' Frederic Wertham's book about the nasty effects that violent, gruesome comics have on children, moved comic book publishers to abide by a ''comics code,'' a self-imposed decency standard. Some comic book artists cleaned up their act. The rest went underground. The world of comics split into the cute and fantastical mainstream and the down and gritty underground.</p><p>Graphic novels grew from the second strain. In 1978 Mr. Eisner created ''A Contract With God,'' a comic book story about Frimme Hersh, a Jewish immigrant who becomes a slumlord when he discovers that God has broken his sacred contract (if you are good, good things will happen to you). The story was set on a street of tenements in the Bronx. Mr. Eisner drew on life experience. He used rain to connote emotion, which came to be called ''Eisner spritz.''</p><p>Grim realism had come to the world of comics. A bond was forged between American comics and the social realism of artists like Ben Shahn and Kathe Kollwitz. (For some reason the imagery of many graphic novels seems to be stuck in the 1930's.)</p><p>There was something earnest and something hideous about them. The playwright Tony Kushner once described the experience of reading a book-length comic as ''thrilling, alarming, faintly nauseating.'' He was describing a cartoon history of the Soviet Union, it turns out, but he hit upon a truth about graphic novels: ''The flat black called to mind mud, excrement, and the burnt bones that are the source of a carbon soot pure enough for India ink.'' Graphic novels are anti-escape literature.</p><p>Some artists didn't like it one bit. As Mr. Eisner recalled, Rube Goldberg, the inventor of comic contraptions, scolded him for his pretensions: ''We're vaudevillians. Never forget that. We tell jokes!'' Mr. Eisner ignored him. And he called his comic book a graphic novel to get the attention of serious publishers.</p><p>Now the monster is out of the box. Mr. Eisner's graphic novel has inspired others. Professors teach courses on comic books and graphic novels in departments of comparative literature, English and Judaic studies. (The creators of Superman, Batman, Sandman, Mad magazine, ''Maus,'' ''Tantrum,'' and ''Julius Knipl: Real Estate Photographer'' were all Jewish.) A course on Surrealism includes ''Gasoline Alley,'' ''Jingle Jangle Tales'' and ''Krazy Kat'' as required reading.</p><p>And there are the academic conferences. At this one, Samuel R. Delany, a professor of comparative literature at the University of Massachusetts, invoked Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe and Walter Benjamin to analyze Eddie Campbell's ''From Hell,'' a 16-part comic about Jack the Ripper. James Reibman, a Samuel Johnson scholar, discussed the Gothic revival in ''The Crow,'' James O'Barr's ''saga of love and violent retribution.'' A panel of scholars and cartoonists addressed the issue of black superheroes. As William Foster, an English professor at Naugatuck Valley Community Technical College in Waterbury, Conn., put it: It's all fine and good to have comics with black schoolteachers fighting drugs in the city, ''but who is standing toe to toe with Superman?''</p><p>Do comic books really deserve such sober treatment?</p><p>At least some do, says James Young, the author of ''The Texture of Memory'' and a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who spoke on behalf of Art Spiegelman's ''Maus.'' He argued that this comic isn't just a shocking presentation of a Holocaust story; it is the perfect form for it.</p><p>The generation born just after World War II, he explained, does not really have memories of the Holocaust. ''They remember what the survivors passed down to them in diaries, stories, videos. What distinguishes them is their sense of vicariousness.'' And ''Maus,'' he said, expresses that vicariousness better than any other form could.</p><p>In the book, ''the son, Artie, recalls what happened at the hand of the father as the father recalls what happened at the hands of the Nazis,'' Professor Young said. The reader sees competing stories: what the father says and what the son hears. The mixture of words and images allows for that kind of layering. ''The way you read it is the way you make sense of things, letting the eye do what it has got to do to get through a page.''</p><p>In other words, as Mr. McCloud argues in ''Understanding Comics,'' the real drama happens between the panels as readers are forced to fill in the missing information.</p><p>Perhaps that is why one of the tenser moments of the conference happened between the panels: not during a lecture but at a lunch, when some cartoonists and scholars turned to the question of the proper way to read a comic book. Text first? Pictures first? Or both together?</p><p>One man said: ''I read the story first, then go back and look at the pictures. It sets me up emotionally.''</p><p>Howard Cruse disagreed. ''It will diminish your enjoyment of the story if you peek ahead,'' said Mr. Cruse, author of ''Stuck Rubber Baby,'' a comic about a gay man coming out in the Bible Belt. The pictures, after all, are ''about subtext,'' he said; they ''illuminate what's not being said, what's being avoided.''</p><p>Mr. Delany said he distrusted people who read comics without looking at the drawings. ''It's like people who go to see the opera.''</p><p>Thomas Inge, a humanities professor at Randolph-Macon Women's College in Lynchburg, Va., said, ''For me an opera is to see.''</p><p>Mr. Delany smiled, ''You're not a purist.''</p><p>Not a purist? Ooof! That hurts! Somebody call Superman!</p><p>Photos: A page from Howard Cruse's ''Stuck Rubber Baby,'' about a gay man coming out in the South in the 1960's; ''Stuck Rubber Baby'' (1995); ''A Con-tract With God'' (1978) was the first graphic novel.
