                    <p>The theme of the four-day conference, which was attended by 3,000 gerontologists, academics, nurses, social workers and others, was a celebration of aging. As such, Mr. Carter, who looked fit and younger than his years, was a fitting choice as the keynote speaker, opening the event on Thursday.</p><p>Many of the conference workshops emphasized the importance of relationships to the health and well-being of older people, and Mr. Carter told the audience that he had taken particular satisfaction in his marriage of nearly 53 years.</p><p>''Our love has deepened in many ways, including in physical ways,'' he said. ''We have made a deliberate decision to do more things together.''</p><p>He said that while he and his wife had had difficult times, and plenty of arguments, they had learned to forgive each other. Mr. Carter described one argument, not so long ago, that went on for days.</p><p>''We could hardly speak to each other,'' he said. ''We wrote ugly notes back and forth on our computers.''</p><p>Finally, he went to his woodworking shop and fashioned a check from a piece of walnut. ''I wrote on it: 'This is good for the rest of our lives for an apology or forgiveness, whichever we prefer,' '' he said. ''I signed it, and I gave it to Rosalynn.</p><p>''She uses it frequently,'' he added.</p><p>Death as Part of Life</p><p>In addition to exploring the opportunities of life, Mr. Carter said, it is also necessary to think about the end of life. He talked about his family history. ''My father died of pancreatic cancer,'' he said. ''My mother died of pancreatic cancer. My older sister died of pancreatic cancer, as did my youngest sister, as did my only brother. I'm the only one left.''</p><p>All of his family members died at home, he said. ''They've not been strangled by tubes.'' He said he and his wife had signed living wills stating that they do not want to be kept alive by artificial means.</p><p>A Place for the Frail</p><p>If Jimmy Carter is the embodiment of what is talked about these days as successful aging, then what about people who cannot play tennis and climb mountains? What about the frail elderly? Are they to be viewed as failures at aging? If independence and autonomy are among the highest American virtues, then how shall those who have no choice but to depend on others be regarded?</p><p>These were some of the questions posed by Mark H. Waymack, an associate professor of philosophy and co-director of graduate programs in health care at Loyola University, in a workshop called ''Dependency and the American Myth of Rugged Individualism.''</p><p>''One of the theses of the new gerontology is that successful aging is not an aging of dependency,'' Dr. Waymack said. ''You climb mountains, play tennis, go hiking. I'm worried about the elderly who are in nursing homes, or in home care, and who find it difficult to get out of their homes because they're frail and dependent. And they may be dependent in ways we can't change.'' He also pointed out that money often buys health and independence.</p><p>There have to be new models for what is regarded as successful aging, Dr. Waymack said. ''What's wrong with being dependent?'' he asked. ''We don't think it's shameful for children to be dependent. Why do we then think it's shameful for adults to be dependent?''</p><p>Old Age as Liberation</p><p>In his lecture on creativity and aging, Gene Cohen, a psychiatrist and gerontologist, quoted William Carlos Williams, who wrote about ''an old age that adds as it takes away.'' The poet was 79 when he published ''Pictures from Brueghel and Other Poems,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, said Dr. Cohen, who is the director of the Center on Aging, Health and Humanities at George Washington University.</p><p>Dr. Cohen said he had found astonishing painting, sculpture and collages among elderly people who had never considered themselves artists.</p><p>He spoke of a ''liberation phase,'' which can begin in the mid-60's and 70's, and which can be demonstrated in everything from social action to evolving family relationships -- both of which can be creative, he said -- to painting and sculpture. ''Many people feel free to do the right thing,'' he said. ''They feel this creative push to do what they might have done. If not now, when?''</p>                </div>
