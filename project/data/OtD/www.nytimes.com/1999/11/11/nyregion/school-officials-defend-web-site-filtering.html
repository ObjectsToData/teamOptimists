                    <p>As more teachers came forward yesterday with new accounts of students doing research being blocked from Internet access, New York City school officials yesterday defended their use of a computer program that filters out sites with references to weapons and breasts, even if the sites were about medieval weapons and breast cancer.</p><p>One teacher told how students studying the Middle Ages had been barred from Web sites about medieval weapons -- including the American Museum of Natural History and the Society for Creative Anachronism -- even though they would help students better understand the curriculum.</p><p>''The Board of Education has left me high and dry,'' said Debra Sandella, a fifth-grade teacher at the Manhattan School for Children on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ''It's a technical world, and if they can't get access through technology, these children will be at a severe disadvantage.''</p><p>Chad Vignola, counsel to Chancellor Rudy Crew, said accounts by teachers, students and the New York Civil Liberties Union about the filtering software were exaggerated, and denied that the board was trying to censor access to information. But a day after the complaints became public, Mr. Vignola and other board officials said they could not confirm or deny that specific Web sites -- including those for Planned Parenthood, CNN, The New York Times and The Daily News -- were not available to schools.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Vignola said the board had no immediate plans to remove or modify the software, which affects all schools hooked up to the central board's computer system, on a systemwide basis. But he said that over the next 60 days, the board would be training school staffs to use the software and modify it as they see fit.</p><p>At a news conference at the board's headquarters in Brooklyn, Jackson Tung, the board's director of technology, gave out his office telephone number -- (718) 935-4500 -- inviting schools to call him if teachers or administrators felt their educational programs were being damaged by the filtering. He said his office would try to help them.</p><p>Later, a spokeswoman for the chancellor, Pam McDonnell, said ''Ideally, we're not going to want to do it one by one, but if we have to, we have to.''</p><p>The problem began as the board tried to expand its Internet program, using a $100 million federal grant called Project Connect. The grant has provided a high-speed Internet connection for all 1,100 city schools this year, board officials said. Almost every school is connected through the board's central server at the Metrotech Center in Brooklyn.</p><p>The board installed a filtering program, I-Gear, produced by the Symantec Corporation, on its server. Board officials said yesterday that I-Gear was chosen because it could be programmed to make very fine distinctions, for instance, between ''big breast and chicken breast,'' and to tailor its filter to individual schools or even to individual students.</p><p>Bernard I. May, senior product manager of Symantec, in Cupertino, Calif., said it was up to customers to make those finer judgments. He said he could not explain why entire Web sites, like the Museum of Natural History or Planned Parenthood, might have been banned by the Board of Education. ''We give them every flexibility,'' he said. ''That's the beauty of the system, and it's their choice how to implement it.''</p><p>Mr. Vignola said that in the board's haste to provide Internet access, it used ready-made filtering categories from Symantec. A board employee picked five broad categories of information -- sex, nudity, hate, racism and weapons -- from 23 provided by the software program.</p><p>Teachers said the categories were so broad that students got a message saying ''access denied'' when they tried to gain access to Web sites for the National Rifle Association, sites with references to John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' and sites about breast cancer, child labor, anorexia and bulimia, and AIDS.</p><p>Jan Shakofsky, a humanities teacher at Cardozo High School in Queens, said students working on a project about diabetes among black and Hispanic teenagers could not get diabetes sites because they mentioned erectile dysfunction. At one point, she said, the Special Olympics was blocked out, as was all news and all weather. So were the Justice Department crime statistics.</p><p>Mr. Vignola said the long-range goal of the school system was to provide ''educationally sound access to any materials'' that schools wanted, even if that meant sites about the Ku Klux Klan. In the meantime, he suggested, schools should be glad for ''half a loaf,'' when, until now, they had no Internet access at all.</p><p>After initially denying that the board had received any complaints about the filter, Ms. McDonnell said yesterday that complaints had come in since the beginning of the year from four schools -- Cardozo and Thomas Jefferson High Schools and Booker T. Washington and Joan of Arc middle schools. In those schools, she said, the board modified the filter to permit access to the e-mail system Hotmail, the Internet search engine Yahoo, and sites on gun control and drugs.</p><p>Ingrid Montealegre, a technology consultant to several public schools, said the board's server had made it hard for teachers to set up e-mail accounts and video conferencing to allow students to exchange notes and information with students outside New York.</p><p>Phil Russo, a spokesman for the board, said e-mail was not an educational priority.</p><p>Mr. Vignola said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who charged on Tuesday that the filter was a way of censoring free speech and educational materials, had said in conversations with board officials that even pornography should be available to students. ''He doesn't believe pornography per se should be blocked from schools,'' Mr. Vignola said.</p><p>Mr. Siegel said that he had never spoken with Mr. Vignola and that Mr. Vignola was wrong about his views. He cited a letter he faxed to Dr. Crew on Tuesday, which states: ''The N.Y.C.L.U. does not expect that schools will afford students unfettered access to the Internet. Games, chat rooms and pornography are legitimately excluded.''</p><p>A 1996 Board of Education ''Internet Usage Policy,'' posted on the board's Web site, bans access to ''pornographic or obscene materials'' but does not provide any other guidelines on information that students should or should not be able to call up.</p>                </div>
