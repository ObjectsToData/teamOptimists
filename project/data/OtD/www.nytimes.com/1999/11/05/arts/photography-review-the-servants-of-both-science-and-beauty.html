                    <p>The New York Public Library has smartly titled its exhibition of 700 years' worth of glorious scientific illustrations ''Seeing Is Believing'' just when digitization has raised doubts about believing your eyes.</p><p>Photography long ago undermined the credibility of drawings, which make up most of this show. As recently as this century, Percival Lowell's drawings of the canals he saw on Mars were believed until better telescopes and the photographs taken through them found neither canals nor little green men who could have dug them. The computer later damaged photography's reputation for truthfulness, yet scientific photographs inspire faith even today; there seeing is, still, believing, and truth a viable concept.</p><p>The library has mounted four related exhibitions, two of them purely photographic: ''Berenice Abbott: Science Photographs,'' a show of some 30 images, and ''Earth From Above: An Aerial Portrait on the Eve of the Year 2000,'' 58 photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand. Ms. Abbott's photographs make difficult concepts understandable and thus easier to accept. Mr. Arthus-Bertrand makes some areas of the planet so mysterious they would be incredible were they not photographs.</p><p>Take Ms. Abbott's demonstration of Galileo's famous experiment in which he dropped objects of different weights from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa to prove they would land simultaneously. For physics illiterates, this defies logic, but Ms. Abbott's vertical strips of photographs showing a large ball and a small one keeping perfect time with each other as they fall past a marked-off measure make the principle clearly visible.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Her photographs are not merely explanatory; they are also uncommonly satisfying in aesthetic terms. The cycloid, the crystalline structure of some metals and the parabolic curves of a bouncing ball are more vivid and compelling in her photographs than any diagram, and the wave patterns of water would do an abstract artist proud. Though she is better known as a photographer of New York in the 1930's, Ms. Abbott's scientific pictures are her most original work and in some ways her most beautiful.</p><p>She was convinced of the centrality of science long before she photographed it. Asked to write about contemporary culture in 1928 by an editor who suggested Surrealism and Communism, she came back with comics, movies, architecture, science. ''What about our scientists, in fact?'' she wrote. ''Microbes! The biggest movements are not named.'' Ten years later she declared: ''There needs to be a friendly interpreter between science and the layman. I believe photography can be this spokesman.''</p><p>No one paid much attention. In the 1940's, she invented devices and processes for scientific photography, including Super Sight, a kind of macrophotography that produced stunningly clear 16-by-20-inch contact-print close-ups of soap suds and penicillin mold. Though she became picture editor for Science Illustrated in the 1940's, she had trouble selling her scientific photographs. Few had caught up with her views on the interface between science and photography. In 1957 Sputnik changed their minds.</p><p>The Soviet satellite sent the United States scurrying to improve scientific education. Some were concerned even earlier. In 1956 the Physical Science Study Committee -- composed of distinguished physicists, high school teachers and educators -- was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to improve the high school physics curriculum. Since only 25 percent of high school graduates had any education in physics, the goal was to design a first-rate course to attract more.  Sputnik brought National Science Foundation money to the project, and in 1958, Ms. Abbott, nearly 60, was hired by the committee for the first full-time, salaried job of her life.</p><p>She worked closely with scientists and devised her own processes, such as a way to take stop-action photograms -- photographs made without a camera -- of wave actions in water. The results were artfully composed, perfectly lighted and new. When ''Physics'' was published in 1960, with many diagrams and many of Ms. Abbott's photographs, a few by Harold Edgerton, inventor of the strobe, and some taken with microscopes or telescopes, it made the usual physics text, with its smattering of diagrams and a photograph or two of scientists with their equipment, look as if it was suffering from malnutrition.</p><p>There seems to have been a consensus that in physics, probably in science generally, good illustration educates as well as making information more inviting. And Ms. Abbott's photographs were exhibited in schools and museums even before the book was published, giving some people their first look at fine-art photography.</p><p>The physics course also included lab work, teacher education and 50 instructional films, which were less successful because few prominent physicists come across like Sean Connery on screen. Still, the textbook was translated into 14 languages, including Japanese, Korean and Turkish, and the publishers never permitted the foreign editions to make the pictures smaller. The seventh edition came out in 1991. Alas, you can build a better mousetrap and take better pictures and still have an untrodden path to your door. Barely a dozen years ago, only 15 percent of American high school graduates had had any instruction in physics, which after all is about nothing less than the way the world works.</p>                </div>
