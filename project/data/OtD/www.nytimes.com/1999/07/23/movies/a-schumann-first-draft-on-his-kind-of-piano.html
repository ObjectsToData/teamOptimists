    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In the concert hall, Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto is less ubiquitous than it was a couple of decades ago, but a vast backlist of recordings has helped it retain its status as one of the most popular concertos in the repertory, and the very definition of a war horse. But Robert Levin, the pianist and musicologist who is to play the work tonight with Sir John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, is hoping his reading will help audiences hear the work a bit differently.    For one thing, he is performing it on a Conrad Graf piano from Schumann's time; the instrument was built in 1830, 11 years before Schumann began work on the Fantasy for piano and orchestra that eventually become the concerto. He is also using music based on the manuscript of the work, and different in both subtle and striking ways from the standard published edition. The manuscript, a first draft, does not take into account Schumann's later thoughts or changes (and errors) introduced during the editorial process. Mr. Levin has performed the work many times on a modern piano, and in the version that pianists have been playing for more than 150 years. But since his performance is part of Mr. Gardiner's ''Schumann Revealed'' series of period-instrument performances at Lincoln Center Festival '99, the historical approach seemed the order of the day.

	data-description="In the concert hall, Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto is less ubiquitous than it was a couple of decades ago, but a vast backlist of recordings has helped it retain its status as one of the most popular concertos in the repertory, and the very definition of a war horse. But Robert Levin, the pianist and musicologist who is to play the work tonight with Sir John Eliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, is hoping his reading will help audiences hear the work a bit differently.    For one thing, he is performing it on a Conrad Graf piano from Schumann's time; the instrument was built in 1830, 11 years before Schumann began work on the Fantasy for piano and orchestra that eventually become the concerto. He is also using music based on the manuscript of the work, and different in both subtle and striking ways from the standard published edition. The manuscript, a first draft, does not take into account Schumann's later thoughts or changes (and errors) introduced during the editorial process. Mr. Levin has performed the work many times on a modern piano, and in the version that pianists have been playing for more than 150 years. But since his performance is part of Mr. Gardiner's ''Schumann Revealed'' series of period-instrument performances at Lincoln Center Festival '99, the historical approach seemed the order of the day.

But since his performance is part of Mr. Gardiner's ''Schumann Revealed'' series of period-instrument performances at Lincoln Center Festival '99, the historical approach seemed the order of the day.</p><p>''I'm constantly stimulated by the kinds of choices that playing on these older instruments forces one to think about,'' Mr. Levin said. ''After all, a composer who writes music that is not ideally suited to the instrument at hand is like a tailor who makes you a suit that might not fit you, but might fit someone else. When you write a concerto or a symphony, you push the envelope; you challenge the musicians in all sorts of extraordinary ways, and you exploit the sonorities and acoustic properties in a manner that redefines the capabilities of the instruments.</p><p>''Composers always wanted more from their instruments, and when instrument makers gave them more, they wanted more still. So I'm not saying that Schumann would have hated the modern Steinway. I'm saying that if he had one, he would have written different music. This Conrad Graf instrument allows things to happen which I hope will make people think a little about the relationship between sound and utterance.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Graf's piano factory was the most famous in Vienna during the early years of the 19th century. Although the volume the Graf produces should be more than sufficient for Alice Tully Hall, its strings are under less tension than those of a modern piano, so its sustaining power is not as great.</p><p>The lower tension in the strings also means that the piano's bass response is less aggressive than the bass on a modern piano.</p><p>The Graf is one of seven pianos, modern and antique, that Mr. Levin and his wife, Ya-Fei Chuang, also a pianist, have in their home in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Levin noted that if he wanted further variety, he had the use of several more historical and modern pianos at Harvard University, where he is a professor of humanities. Now 51, he is best known as a Mozartean. He has won great acclaim for performances of Mozart's solo works and concertos in which he embellishes Mozart's piano line and improvises his cadenzas, as players in Mozart's time were expected to do.</p><p>He has also been known to improvise fantasies on the spot, based on themes provided by audience members, and worked out in a thoroughly Mozartean style. And his groundbreaking completions and reconstructions of several Mozart works -- including the Requiem, the Symphonie Concertante (K. 297b) and works for horn and orchestra -- are regularly performed and have been recorded.</p><p>But a glance at Mr. Levin's discography, as well as the programs in which he has performed in recent years as a member of New York Philomusica, a chamber ensemble, shows that his repertory is quite broad, ranging from Bach, Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms, through Poulenc, Hindemith, Shostakovich, Schnittke and Carter.</p><p>His contemporary music leanings are not surprising; in the 1960's he studied composition with Stefan Wolpe in New York and with Nadia Boulanger at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau. Near the end of Boulanger's life, he took over as director of the school. He was also on the piano faculty at the Hochschule fur Musik in Freiburg, Germany, and at the State University of New York at Purchase, and he was head of the music theory department at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia for several years.</p><p>Tracking Down the Score</p><p>Mr. Levin's involvement with historical Schumann has included participation in previous versions of Mr. Gardiner's series in London and Paris in 1997.</p><p>But his interest in the manuscript of the concerto goes back to his friendship with the pianist Malcolm Frager, who died at age 56 in 1991, and whom Mr. Levin describes as ''a sleuth and a bibliophile as well as an extraordinary pianist.''</p><p>Frager had been a student of Carl Friedberg, who in turn had studied with Clara Schumann, the composer's wife, for whom the concerto was written. Friedberg had always told Frager that the late-Romantic style in which the work was performed through much of the 20th century obscured the real passion in the music. Frager, who had tracked down the manuscripts to several important works by other composers, began searching for the Schumann. As it turned out, that manuscript had been in a private collection since 1912. Frager found its owner, in Germany, and was allowed to study and photograph the score. Apparently, no one before Frager had asked to work with it.</p>                </div>
