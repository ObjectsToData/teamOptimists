    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="SIX decades ago, the threat of Nazi book burnings and German bombs spurred a project to preserve some of the earliest writings in the English language on microfilm. Eugene Power, a Michigan microfilm entrepreneur who had already begun photographing the first books printed in English, was selected by the Rockefeller Foundation and a scholarly organization to make microfilm versions of treasured British collections.    He was impeded only temporarily when a German torpedo sank the ship carrying his  cameras. Over five years, Mr. Power preserved centuries-old manuscripts and books in photographic form. The printed works from the project became part of Mr. Power's early English microfilm collection, available today for sale worldwide. Now a modern extension of the late Mr. Power's work is under way: creating an on-line version of that same microfilm, which covers nearly 80 percent of all books printed between 1475 and 1700 in England or in English.

''It's making this material much more available to scholars around the world,'' said Jeff Moyer, the company's vice president of product management.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The market for Early English Books Online, as the project is known, is expected to be libraries, most of them on college campuses, which will be able to tap into the materials for a fee. A half-dozen schools have already signed up.</p><p>Some see a chance to ease the strain on space -- and on floor beams -- from large, heavy microfilm cabinets. Others hope to get relief from the eye-spinning tedium of temperamental microfilm readers -- ''a fact of library life,'' said Dr. Richard Oram, head librarian at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>Perhaps most appealing to scholars is the comprehensiveness of the early English collection, coupled with the ability to search the title citations and sort by author, date and subject.</p><p>''It enables you to think up projects you couldn't have done before,'' said Dr. Mary Fissell, an associate professor of medical history who viewed a demonstration at Johns Hopkins University. ''If you know you can do that kind of work, you're going to be more broad-ranging.''</p><p>Harold Billings, director of general libraries for the University of Texas, which purchased the collection for its 15-campus, 150,000-student system, said, ''The importance of it is having access to a larger body of knowledge available to most users wherever and whenever they need it.'' That is not the case with microfilm because a given reel can be viewed by only one person at a time.</p><p>The on-line page images, saved in the TIFF format, lack the feel of dog-eared parchment, but there are research benefits. Margin notes, printers' markings, typography, illustrations and other historical markers can all be studied in works as varied as Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales,'' Nicholas Culpeper's ''English Physician,'' King James's tirade against the evils of tobacco and the Thomason compendium on the English Civil War.</p><p>''You want to see how it really looked on the page,'' said Dr. Tom Izbicki, collection development coordinator for the Milton S. Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins. ''You can't get to the library that has the one and only copy. I think it's going to have a lot of utility for people.'' Johns Hopkins plans to have the on-line collection up and running by the fall.</p><p>The service is expensive. Permanent access to the on-line collection begins at $93,000. For year-to-year access, fees range from $12,000 to $19,000, depending on whether a library already has Bell &amp; Howell's microfilm. The company expects to enlist 150 to 250 libraries and recoup its development costs in three or four years, Mr. Moyer said. The early English collection is a fraction of the company's microfilm archive, which has 5.5 billion pages and includes newspapers, dissertations and other scholarly materials -- all scheduled for on-line access in coming years.</p><p>''It's a niche market,'' said Marta Nichols, a financial equity analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''But if you position yourself to be the primary content provider of archived information going back hundreds of years, that's a lasting business model. There will always be a demand for that information. If Bell &amp; Howell hadn't done it, at some point someone would have come along and been able to digitize that information.''</p><p>Like other, less-ambitious, scanning efforts, the English collection is ideal for Web-adept students who increasingly want to work on line, said Maureen Sullivan, president of the Association of College and Research Libraries. ''The students want to hit a few keystrokes and have it available,'' she said.</p><p>It wasn't that easy, however, for Catherine Belsey, an English literature professor at Cardiff University in Wales, where Early English Books Online is on trial. After three hours of unsuccessfully trying to call up books from Shakespearean times, she said, she wanted to hurl her computer ''at the proprieters of E.E.B.O. or any passing stranger.'' Her colleague, Prof. David Skilton, had better luck and speculated that Dr. Belsey's office computer might have been part of the problem.</p><p>Even with collections like the Early English Books Online going on line, humble microfilm isn't expected to lose its place as a reliable preservation tool, much as libraries themselves retain a role in the electronic world.</p><p>''Increasingly we're understanding that the library's place will continue,'' Ms. Sullivan said. ''But it will be transformed so that the information and resources will be available in a variety of formats.''</p><p>Photo: Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' is being scanned from microfilm into an on-line collection.
