                    <p>Q. Your last book, ''Design By Numbers,'' (M.I.T. Press) is an art book that is also a manual for a new computer language that you invented to help artists understand the guts of computer design. Why create a whole new computer language?</p><p>A. Several reasons. I wanted to make a system that was free of charge. Second, all the programming languages are in English. Because this one is free and distributed on the Web, we are now offering it in French, Spanish and German. It will soon be in Korean and Japanese.</p><p>The third reason was that programming languages are made for people to write programs -- big applications.</p><p>For someone just starting out making art on their computers, they don't want this big Mack truck of a system. They just want a simple bicycle that they understand.</p><p>So I designed the visual equivalent of a simple bicycle. Design by Numbers, D.B.N., was an attempt to demystify the technology behind computer art, to show how simple it is, and that people can do it. D.B.N. can run directly within any Java-enabled Web browser. The Web site address, by the way, is dbn.media.mit.edu.</p><p>Q. When you are creating your own computer art pieces, do you ever use prepackaged drawing programs like Adobe?</p><p>A. Oh, yes, all the time. There are all kinds of fine touches that prepackaged software makes easy. I could invent my own finishing system, but this is faster. Of course, the basic ideas, I create.</p><p>Q. Yet, I sense you're scornful of Adobe users?</p><p>A. The problem is that most people can't just ''finish'' things with it. They have to use it to start them, also. For much of recent history, people have created with brush, ink, paper -- the materials of art. Now that they have begun creating with software and computers, the styles that emerge are homogeneous because the software is universal.</p><p>Without being able to know how to program, you can't break out of the technology -- just like if you don't know how to use brush and ink, you're limited.</p><p>For most people, this really isn't a problem; they aren't necessarily looking for anything new. But for people who are seeking the next step, the prepackaged becomes an impossible barrier to break free from.</p><p>I make everything I do. Many people are surprised that I don't have a programmer making things for me.  And others are surprised that I don't have an artist controlling me, telling me how to program. Because today, people don't realize that it is possible to think and create on the computer. Artists are used to thinking that programming is very hard -- impossible.</p><p>And technologists are used to thinking that they can never become artists. Me, I just make things. It's just a natural flow of action and thought. If people see, ''Oh, he does that,'' then maybe they'll think, ''I can do it too.''</p><p>Q. But lots of nonartists use computers for creating images . . .</p><p>A. They are using it as a tool, but not as a material. And to use it as a tool, you need to understand the medium, which means understanding the technology. Young people are changing this, because they have grown up with computers.</p><p>Q. If a conventional artist produces an object on a computer, does that automatically make it art?</p><p>A. It's art, but it's just a painting and no different than conventional art.</p><p>It's not intrinsically different or superior just because it was created digitally and it's not digital art. Because digital art starts with an understanding and appreciation of the medium -- which, unfortunately, is today programming.</p><p>Q. When you were growing up in Seattle, what were your aspirations?</p><p>A. My aspirations were my father's -- and his were that all of us kids would go to either Harvard or M.I.T. He didn't know what or where they were.</p><p>He was a cook and a tofu maker by trade. These were the only two schools he'd heard of. His were immigrants' dreams.</p><p>Also, I was very good at math and at drawing and I had a teacher who said, ''You should go to M.I.T. because it's a good place for math.''</p><p>Q. Did the term artist ever come on your screen as a child?</p><p>A. Some of my teachers felt that I should become an artist, but my parents looked down upon this because they pictured me as poor.</p>                </div>
