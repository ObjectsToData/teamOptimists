A New York chinaware merchant who became the first United States Ambassador to Japan, Townsend Harris died in 1878 in relative obscurity, and his grave at Green-Wood Cemetery in Sunset Park went unattended for decades. The entourage from the school, which had reopened in 1984 after being shuttered for 42 years, refurbished the grave, installing a black marble plaque and a stone lantern.  ">

                    <p>On a muggy day in July 1987, two busloads of students, teachers and administrators traveled from their ramshackle school building in Queens to a sprawling cemetery in Brooklyn to memorialize the man for whom their recently revived high school was named: Townsend Harris.</p><p>A New York chinaware merchant who became the first United States Ambassador to Japan, Townsend Harris died in 1878 in relative obscurity, and his grave at Green-Wood Cemetery in Sunset Park went unattended for decades. The entourage from the school, which had reopened in 1984 after being shuttered for 42 years, refurbished the grave, installing a black marble plaque and a stone lantern.</p><p>The ceremony was a symbolic moment for a school that critics had fought to keep closed. The proposal to reopen Townsend Harris came at a time when the city was looking to move away from such schools that essentially skimmed off the best students. So critics mounted a campaign urging parents not to send their children there.</p><p>But they did. And today, the school is embraced by residents and educators alike. In 15 years, Townsend Harris has climbed to the top of academic charts in the state and across the country, and four years ago moved into a glinting new building on the Queens College campus in Flushing. It even outshone the venerable Stuyvesant High School in this year's State English Regents exam.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''In the beginning, there was a lot of political pressure that really was not in our favor,'' said Malcolm G. Largmann, the school's 62-year-old principal. ''There was a rumor every June that we would not be back. But by the fifth year, it was clear that we were here to stay.''</p><p>Teachers and parents largely credit Dr. Largmann, a strict disciplinarian who runs a rigid academic program, for Townsend's success. They also say that the school's humanities-based curriculum propels its students academically and gives them an edge on standardized tests like the Regents and the S.A.T.'s. According to state statistics for the 1997-98 school year, all of the school's graduating seniors went on to a four-year college.</p><p>A old-guard tweedy intellectual who grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, Dr. Largmann has brought mostly veteran teachers to a staff that has a low turnover. But the school's achievement is underscored by the fact that students must apply to gain entry. Although the school does not use an entrance exam, its admissions formula considers test scores and grades among other criteria.</p><p>Students have access to unlimited resources at Queens College, and seniors can take college courses. ''Our reputation is that of a tough school,'' Dr. Largmann said. ''If a student applies here, they know what's expected.''</p><p>Indeed, the school's more than 1,000 students quickly become aware of the strict code of discipline and study when they enter as freshman. They have no study halls. Most schools start the day with homeroom, but Townsend Harris students start with their first class. Many spend the first three years studying into the wee hours of the morning and are known for carrying some of the heaviest backpacks in the city. Though they complain about the pressure, many students are driven by it, giving the school a palpable esprit de corps.</p><p>''The teachers are very demanding,'' said Anthony A. Prince, a 17-year-old of St. Albans, Queens, who graduated last week and will attend Brown University in the fall. ''They expect the best of you, and it's something that pays off in college. I've spoken to graduates of Townsend Harris who say the transition period from high school to college is a breeze. It's actually less work and less stressful. The teachers put the work on here, but it pays off in the end.''</p><p>Dr. Largmann, a short, thin, gray-haired man, often stops into classes unannounced to hold discussions and roams the halls to make sure everyone is in class. Students tend to scurry when they see him. One day recently, students lingering around the outdoor amphitheater during lunchtime fled when Dr. Largmann walked outside to show a visitor the school's seven-story beige brick exterior. They returned when he left.</p><p>Alan Fu, a 17-year-old from Bayside, Queens, who was editor of the school newspaper said that Dr. Largmann is less stern when he is among upperclassmen.</p><p>''He's really a good guy,'' said Alan, who will attend Northwestern University in the fall. ''He's just very demanding.''</p><p>Some parents fear that the school's air of intensity and obedience could force students to lose individuality.</p><p>''Academically, it's an excellent school,'' said Eddie Marritz, an Upper West Side resident whose daughter, Leda, 17, commutes to Townsend Harris. ''There is an authoritarian tone, which I think squashes certain forms of individualism. This is a high school for humanities, but I think in general it can benefit from more arts.''</p><p>Like its predecessor but unlike other selective schools, Townsend Harris seeks to give students a classical education in liberal arts, requiring each to take two years of Latin or ancient Greek and three years of a modern language. Community service is also required.</p>                </div>
