                    <p>Three years from the start of the 2002 Winter Games, local Olympic officials today prepared for a watershed week in which they will present details of improprieties involved in securing the Olympics and perhaps name a leader who can begin to repair the tarnished image of their Games.</p><p>A lengthy report by the local Olympic organizing committee's internal ethics panel is scheduled for release on Tuesday morning. According to Olympic officials who have been told about the report, it was expected to say that there was limited knowledge among Salt Lake City officials about improper cash payments, tuition aid, medical treatment, jobs and lavish gifts provided to members of the International Olympic Committee and their families.</p><p>An official who saw the report said today that it would primarily target two top officials of the bid committee, Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, and accuse them of hidden payments and deceptive practices that kept other members of the committee from knowing what was going on.</p><p>Such a conclusion was foreshadowed last week by Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah. Without naming names, the Governor portrayed the payment of improper inducements as a ''pattern of deception'' by a small group of rogue officials of the bid committee.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''They had to hide it, because I didn't see it and I don't know at this point of anybody else who did,'' Leavitt said at a news conference.</p><p>Leavitt has also acknowledged that the report would not provide a complete picture of the corruption scandal. The five-person ethics panel, headed by Gordon R. Hall, a former chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court, did not have subpoena power, and some top Olympic officials, including the bid committee's chief administrative officer, declined to testify.</p><p>Welch was president of the bid committee and Johnson head of its international relations. Both Welch and Johnson have resigned, but they have denied wrongdoing and have said that details of the aggressive campaign to win the Games were widely known. Welch has said that Leavitt, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini and Frank Joklik, the chairman of the bid committee, were all aware of at least some aspects of the extravagant efforts to secure the Games.</p><p>Documents of the Salt Lake bid committee have shown that programs for tuition aid and grants to national Olympic committees were detailed in open budget documents. Leavitt has acknowledged giving out expensive gifts to I.O.C. members. But he also said he did not know of rules limiting the price of gifts or that the bid committee had made cash payments or paid for scholarships.</p><p>The New York Times reported last week that Joklik and another member of the board of trustees of the bid committee wrote letters seeking employment for the husband of an international committee member from Finland.</p><p>''They're going to say Welch and Johnson were off the reservation, but it's going to be hard to say that no one had any idea what was going on and they engaged in a cover-up,'' said Stephen Pace, who heads a group called Utahans for Responsible Public Spending and who has been a longtime critic of the Salt Lake City bid process.</p><p>Officials of the I.O.C. and the United States Olympic Committee scrambled today to obtain advance notice of the contents of the ethics panel's report. Richard Pound, the Montreal attorney who is handling the investigation of the I.O.C.'s involvement in the scandal, said that he would not conclude his investigation until the Salt Lake City report is issued.</p><p>Fourteen international committee members have been implicated so far in the scandal. Six have been expelled, three have resigned, three remain under investigation, one has been issued a warning and one has died. The cost for lavish favors, as well as legitimate travel and accommodation expenses, may have reached $3 million.</p><p>Of the three members remaining under investigation, the most powerful is Kim Un Yong of South Korea, a member of the I.O.C.'s executive board who has often been mentioned as a possible successor as president to Juan Antonio Samaranch.</p><p>Kim's future is now in jeopardy and a stinging rebuke of his actions by the Salt Lake City ethics panel could lead the I.O.C. to try to expel him. Kim is not likely to go quietly, and his departure could lead to political infighting and charges and countercharges of further improper conduct.</p><p>It has previously been reported that Kim's son was employed by a local satellite communications company, which was reimbursed for his salary by the Salt Lake City bid committee.</p><p>David Simmons, the former chairman of Keystone Communications, which has since been sold, said today that the bid committee paid about $45,000 of the $75,000 salary that Kim's son received for a year's work and that the rest was covered by other local companies. The amounts were first reported today by USA Today.</p><p>The ethics panel report was also expected to deal with subjects such as other jobs provided for relatives of international committee members; whether money intended for tuition aid was used for other purposes; whether money was pocketed from airline-ticket reimbursement schemes; the extent of lavish gift-giving, and conflicts of interest that existed among bid committee members.</p><p>The appearance of conflicts was underscored by an outside audit performed last August by Deloitte &amp; Touche. The audit showed that about $50 million of a $68.3 million commitment for construction and professional services was with entities that were controlled by or whose officers were members of the organizing committee's board of trustees.</p><p>''The prevailing opinion is that the report will implicate people we already know about, under the theory that if you get rid of them, you solve the problem,'' said one investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''But that doesn't solve the systemic problem. The I.O.C. is set up in a structure of quid pro quo and patronage. There are no controls in place, no accountability. That is what really has to change.''</p><p>Also this week, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee was expected to undergo structural changes designed to increase representation by community members and athletes, to reduce secrecy and to create more reliable oversight. The organizing committee was expected to be expanded from 33 to 50 or 51 members, though some officials have complained that its size will make the committee too unwieldy.</p><p>A new president of the organizing committee could also be named this week. Joklik resigned on Jan. 8, but is remaining in the position until a successor can be found. The leading candidate is Mitt Romney, 51, the son of the former Michigan governor George W. Romney and a political aspirant himself who lost a United States Senate race to Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1994.</p><p>A venture capitalist in Boston, Romney is a graduate of Brigham Young University, as well as Harvard Business School. He has the sort of unblemished reputation that Salt Lake City officials believe is necessary to restore the badly damaged image of the 2002 Winter Games.</p><p>But anyone who takes over the organizing committee must be prepared for further buffeting. The United States Justice Department is also investigating the scandal, and its results are not expected for five or six months.</p><p>Joining Hall on the Salt Lake City ethics panel are David Jordan, a former United States attorney; Patricia Hanna, dean of the college of humanities and a philosophy professor at the University of Utah; Barbara Lockhart, a professor of physical education at Brigham Young University and a former Olympic speed skater, and Merrill Norman, a certified public accountant.</p><p>Photo: At the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, construction continues on student housing that will become part of the Olympic village in 2002.
