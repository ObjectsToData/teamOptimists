Mr. Rosenblatt, the author and essayist who is perhaps most familiar for his appearances on public television's ''Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' and in Time magazine, explained that he and his 14 graduate students from the college's new master of fine arts degree program in writing had been bumped that week from the more spacious classroom they ordinarily use. He was afraid that in such cramped, airless quarters the two-hour session, during which students would criticize one another's stories, might lack the spirit and intensity that had made past classes truly instructive.

For two hours, Mr. Rosenblatt never lost their attention. They asked questions, debated points and criticized. The college had expected only about 15 students to sign up for the whole writing program, but this day's class alone had 14 students, drawn by Mr. Rosenblatt and by such guest lecturers as Kurt Vonnegut and Peter Matthiessen.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Founded in 1963, Southampton College has only 1,300 students and not much of a national image beyond its marine science program, which has produced 27 Fulbright scholars. To burnish its image, the school began the writing program last year after it recruited Mr. Rosenblatt to run the program. Today, it has 35 students.</p><p>On the day Mr. Rosenblatt taught the class in the cramped room, each student had been asked to write a story of 1,000 words about the same object: an old suitcase. Each had submitted the results to Mr. Rosenblatt and gotten them back with his written comments, along with copies of their classmates' stories to be discussed in class.</p><p>''Students are too used to clearing their throats and thinking they have to start with plots,'' he explained. The trouble with that, he said, is that the plots they concoct are invariably ''cockamamie.'' Moreover, he added, ''in short stories nothing happens anyway, or it is a rarity. Usually it has happened before and we want to know who these people are.''</p><p>The standard for in-class criticism, according to Mr. Rosenblatt, is that it should be ''honest, helpful and civil. Astute, too, of course.''</p><p>Most of the comments from students about the suitcase stories were supportive.</p><p>''Arrivals and Departures,'' a story that reveals family tensions through a brief exchange of greetings and banalities at an airport where the parents of a grown son have arrived for a visit, was praised by a student for the author's artful use of dialogue.</p><p>''Let's talk about dialogue,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said. ''One of the things people ought to learn, particularly people who write screenplays, is that people don't really talk to each other that way. People don't answer questions. They talk at and through each other, from a desire to express what they are thinking.''</p><p>''This captures that,'' said the student. ''This is a couple who have lived together far too long.''</p><p>Earlier, Mr. Rosenblatt had noted that on the infrequent occasions when the criticism becomes harsh, the teacher ''has to put his body between the severity and the recipient.''</p><p>The most pitiless criticism on this day was self-inflicted.</p><p>''I hate this story,'' said a young woman of her own effort to portray the anguish of a pregnant girl during a visit to an abortion clinic.</p><p>''You were writing about something, rather than writing a story,'' suggested a classmate.</p><p>''Certain things are so full of pain they explain themselves by being,'' said Mr. Rosenblatt, picking up on the student's comment. ''You don't need to explain them. They serve you.''</p><p>He offered the example of two characters ''within a war together.'' War is the last thing you want them to talk about, he said. ''We know where they are. We want something that, through their conversation, illuminates by refraction.''</p><p>There are some guidelines for writers, Mr. Rosenblatt said, that a teacher can impart to his students with some confidence in their validity. Among them is the concept that it is almost always better not to tell readers what to think, but rather to show them.</p><p>According to the college's division director for the humanities, Robert Pattison, who played a major role in creating the writing program, Mr. Rosenblatt, a Quogue resident, was recruited to help design the program and teach it. He originally joined the faculty of the college in 1997 as the University Professor in Writing, a chair partly endowed by a $700,000 gift from Peter Parsons, a former journalist and publishing executive.</p><p>Also helping the program is its location. The college, the smallest of the university's three residential campuses, is in the heart of a summer resort teeming with renowned writers.</p><p>In addition to Mr. Rosenblatt and two other full-time faculty members -- the poet and critic William Hathaway and the novelist Indira Ganesan -- the teaching roster for 1997-99 includes such luminaries as Mr. Vonnegut, Mr. Matthiessen, Kaylie Jones, Richard Price, the critics Robert Hughes and Paul Goldberger, the nonfiction authors Shana Alexander and Dava Sobel, and the scriptwriter Jules Feiffer.</p><p>Courses are $457 a credit, and applications have exceeded expectations, Mr. Pattison said. He said students are mostly from eastern Long Island, but have come from as far away as Oregon, India and Germany. The program also offers courses in business and science writing, script writing, biography and literary journalism.</p><p>Talent, of course, cannot be taught. But in his classes Mr. Rosenblatt demonstrates that it can be guided, refined and in some cases revealed. He likes to cite the example of an administrator at the State University of New York at Stony Brook whom he described as ''tentative and nervous'' when she entered his class for the program's very first session.</p><p>''Her first story showed it,'' he noted, ''and her second story improved just a bit. But her third just leapt up. Her fourth and fifth were very publishable.''</p><p>At that point, the woman decided to leave her job and become a writer.</p><p>''She'll be broke and she'll be miserable,'' he laughed, ''and that's what we're here for.''</p><p>Photo: Roger Rosenblatt teaches writing at Southampton College and urges the students to give advice to each other to improve their work.
