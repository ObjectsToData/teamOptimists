Ellison began writing the book in 1954, seemed on the verge of completing it in 1967, then kept revising and rethinking it until his death at the age of 80. The novel, ''Juneteenth,'' is set for publication on June 19 or Juneteenth, the anniversary of the day in 1865 when Texas slaves finally learned of the Emancipation Proclamation, which had taken effect two and a half years earlier.

                    <p>The letters and certainly the novel are expected to provide new insight into one of the most celebrated literary figures of the century and one of the most distinctive and idiosyncratic voices on race. Along with collections of essays and early short stories already posthumously published, fragments of an early novel, a novella and memoir have also been found, an enormous literary output coming to light after Ellison's death.</p><p>''It's really iceberg time,'' said John F. Callahan, Ellison's literary executor and a professor of humanities at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore. ''He had all this stuff, and he might not have polished it and done the final revisions to suit a perfectionist like him, but there is a huge amount of work and much of it is very worthwhile stuff.''</p><p>Of most interest, of course, will be ''Juneteenth,'' a 350-page meditation on race and identity. The novel tells the story of a black jazzman turned minister named Hickman, who raises a little boy of ambiguous background, bringing him up as a black child although he looks white. The boy eventually runs away and grows up to be a race-baiting senator from a New England state. After being shot on the Senate floor, the politician summons Hickman to his side and their conversations spin out their shared past.</p><p>''I think anybody who has been affected, moved and influenced by 'Invisible Man' is going to want to read this book,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''It's a very important book. The title refers to the day of liberation, and this book is very much about liberation and the complexities of liberation. Given all the denials and attempts to gloss over the meaning of race, it's an attempt to remind people of some of the profundities of race and of being an American, which was Ellison's great theme. What it means to be a true American was almost a sacred thing for him.''</p><p>Ellison, who was born in Oklahoma City in 1914, began playing the trumpet at age 8 and gravitated toward both music and writing. Visiting a friend in Vermont after World War II, he typed out, ''I am an invisible man,'' and thus began his great novel, which was written over seven years and published in 1952. The book tells the story of an unnamed black man who grows up in the segregated South and moves to New York and battles to create an identity apart from the stereotypes of race.</p><p>The book, with its famous last line, ''Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?'' transcends the black experience as a meditation on identity, alienation and self-definition influenced as much by Dostoyevsky as by black authors like Richard Wright.</p><p>The insistence on an individual identity apart from a group identity often made him a controversial figure and put him at odds with the reigning black intellectuals of his time, particularly the black militants -- he uses the words often in his letters -- of the 1960's and 70's.</p><p>He started thinking about his second novel (it is not a sequel to ''Invisible Man'') even before his first one was published and started working on it in 1954. He was supposed to be close to finishing it in 1967, but a fire at his summer home in the Berkshires destroyed a summer's worth of revisions and he spent the rest of his life refashioning the work.</p><p>Mr. Callahan said the novel being published was the major part of what will eventually be a larger scholarly edition with other sections of the sprawling manuscript included.</p><p>''He didn't finish the novel because it became a saga, and within the saga were a number of possible novels,'' he said. ''But in the midst of it all was this novel that had come to fruition. It's entirely his. Every word. What was needed was extracting it and to some extent getting guidance from his notes about things like sequencing.''</p><p>He continued: ''What he left was like an unfinished house of fiction, and to keep the metaphor, this is like the essence of the house, something he had all but completed. There are other wings of the house that are a good deal less finished and hang together less well.''</p><p>Mr. Callahan said the novel is about the evasion and discovery of identity, a theme that, along with Ellison's efforts to avoid the oversimplifications of race, echo through the letters.</p>                </div>
