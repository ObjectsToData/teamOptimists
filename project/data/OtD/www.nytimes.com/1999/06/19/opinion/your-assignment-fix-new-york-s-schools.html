                    <p>Rudy Crew, the Chancellor of New York City's public schools, occupies one of the hottest seats there is. Parents, teachers, the Mayor and many others have had criticisms of the schools, and suggestions of all sorts have been offered -- vouchers, tougher standards, year-round classes, bigger budgets. Here, an assortment of responses to the question, ''What would you do to improve city schools if you were Rudy Crew?''</p><p>CLARA HEMPHILL is the author of ''The Parents' Guide to New York City's Best Public Elementary Schools'' and the forthcoming ''Public Middle Schools: New York's Best.''</p><p>Making principal salaries competitive is the single most important step the city can take to improve schools. The city is hemorrhaging talent to the suburbs, where principals typically earn $25,000 a year more. Salaries have been frozen since 1995, and some principals now earn less than staff members they supervise.</p><p>Chancellor Crew has held contract negotiations hostage to his demand to abolish tenure. But nearly half the current principals aren't tenured. Working conditions are so poor that vacancies go unfilled for years. Better to compromise on tenure than to allow the brain drain to continue.</p>                </div>

                    <p>JOHNNY RAY YOUNGBLOOD is chairman of the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a network of churches and community groups.</p><p>Chancellor Crew must continue what he began belatedly to do last week: own up to fundamental shortcomings in the school system and insist on tough and measurable accountability for its front-line leaders -- school principals and district superintendents.</p><p>The Chancellor must follow through on his promise to cull the ranks of the 1,100 principals. As many as 100 principals of persistently failing schools should go, as well as up to 10 superintendents. Meanwhile, Dr. Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani must finish devising a new contract that recognizes the demands of the principal's job, generously rewards success and sanctions failure.</p><p>This is the Chancellor's final and most important test.</p><p>LINDA NIEDERMAN SILVER teaches psychology and literature through acting at Health Professions High School in Manhattan.</p><p>Every September and June the temperature during the day varies from 70 degrees to 95 degrees. Students and teachers are among the few people in our society who are still expected to work in buildings that do not have, at the very least, fans.</p><p>Earlier this month the heat index hit 103 degrees. Health advisories were being broadcast -- but when you're stuck in any school all day, it's not possible to ''get to a cool place'' and ''drink plenty of liquids.'' It is archaic and inhumane to expect anyone to excel as a student or be productive as a teacher under these conditions. It is especially unfair to those students who have to take the lengthy Regents Exams in the heat.</p><p>Every classroom in this city needs at least one fan. As we approach the 21st century, a long-overdue goal would be to take us out of 19th-century sweatshop conditions.</p><p>BENNO C. SCHMIDT JR. is chairman of the Edison Project and led the Mayor's Task Force on the City University of New York.</p><p>The key to success is getting nearly all students to read and write by third grade. A school or system in which 90-plus percent of third graders are on track in reading and writing will be able to meet its other challenges. A system where lots of third graders are lost in reading and writing -- in some schools in New York, it's as many as one-half -- will find it virtually impossible to meet any of its other academic benchmarks.</p><p>One would think schools and school systems would organize themselves in relentless pursuit of this goal, but most have not. Yet there are some proven ways to achieve a high level of literacy: choose a reading program that uses several different strategies (phonics, word recognition, etc.), put kids in small groups for reading, train teachers, get parents involved and introduce students to the joys of mastering books rather than just snippets from anthologies.</p><p>If despite such efforts students fall behind, schools need to do whatever it takes -- one-on-one tutoring, summer school -- to get all but seriously impaired children to read well by the end of second grade. Getting outside testing experts to check children's progress along the way can also be extremely helpful.</p><p>Once more point: accountability. Reading programs, schools and systems that fail to achieve high literacy by third grade should be restructured and their personnel retrained -- or they should be replaced.</p><p>JUDITH SLOAN is an actress, writer and juggler who guest teaches in the New York City schools.</p><p>I know a lot of people have already pointed this out, but what New York needs is fewer kids per class and more physical space. I discovered this firsthand at the International High School in Queens in December while teaching juggling for physics and geometry classes.</p><p>First I showed the kids a three-ball pattern. Then I showed them some group patterns. The next week, I divided the class into teams. They had to come up with three different geometric patterns for the balls, on paper and in the air. They had to mark the path of the balls, figure out how many balls could be tossed among how many people, at what speed, with how much arc, and so on. And, while they were at it, they had to explain inertia as it relates to the ball moving through the air.</p><p>The teams went to work furiously on paper. Then they all got up to work out the patterns physically. Thirty kids, 12 languages, 80 balls. AHHHHH!</p>                </div>
