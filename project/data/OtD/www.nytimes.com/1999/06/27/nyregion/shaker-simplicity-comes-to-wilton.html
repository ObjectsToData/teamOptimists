Chairs, tables, cabinets, desks and household objects made in the 19th century by members of this unique communal sect fetch handsome prices at auctions and antique shows and continue to influence designers and craftsmen.</p><p>Yet the men and women who fashioned these prized objects were not inspired by ideals of beauty or of style. They were following the principles of their church, which called for order, simplicity and the avoidance of ornamentation.</p><p>''All work done, or things made in the Church for their own use, ought to be faithfully and well done but plain and without superfluity,'' wrote Father Joseph Meacham of Enfield, the first American-born Shaker.</p><p>The relationship between the religious tenets of the Shakers and the products of their temporal labors is examined in the exhibition, ''Hands to Work, Hearts to God; The Shakers and the World Around Them,'' now at the Betts-Sturges-Blackmar House in Wilton. Presented by the Wilton Historical Society and the Hancock Shaker Village, a museum in Pittsfield, Mass., the show introduces a comprehensive view of Shaker life and features objects drawn from the museum.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''What I realized as I pursued my interest in the Shakers as a cultural group was that people who were attracted to joining the Shakers came from rural New England communities that were very much like the ones in our area,'' said Marilyn Gould, director of the Wilton Historical Society. ''Then I was eager to find out what relationship there might be between the goods people produced once they became Shakers and what was being made elsewhere at that time.</p><p>''What I found out was that the Shakers started out with the same basic forms that everyone was using -- the chairs, the candlestands, the cases of drawers,'' she said. ''But then their desire to simplify took over. Take the candlestand, for example. In the worldly form, the shaft would be elaborately turned and shaped, as would the legs, whereas the Shakers would shape a more simply and more gracefully turned shaft.''</p><p>The principles and traditions that governed Shaker life were brought to the American colonies in 1774 from England by a small group of Shakers, who then traveled throughout the colonies as missionaries, led by their mentor, ''Mother'' Ann Lee. By the mid-19th century, at the peak of the movement, there were 6,000 Shakers and they formed 18 communal villages stretching from Maine to Kentucky.</p><p>Their aim was to devote their lives to God and to create a ''heaven on earth.'' Although their true name was the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearance, they were called Shakers because of the religious dances they performed in their meetinghouses.</p><p>They built their communities by hand, meetinghouse first, with men and women assigned to different tasks and living separately, as celibate Brothers and Sisters. Married couples who joined the Shakers gave up their relationship and lived in communal families, consisting of as many as 100 men and women.</p><p>They raised their own food, made their clothing, produced medicines and developed trades like chair manufacturing and seed production.</p><p>The exhibition, which was supported by a grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council with the financial assistance of the Wilton Bank, emphasizes the work produced by the communities of Hancock and Enfield, Conn., the only Shaker village in this state.</p><p>The introductory room, where the history and beliefs of the Shakers are shown, features a 12-foot dining table set for eight. The men would sit on one side, the women on the other, with large ironstone platters set in the center, so all could help themselves without breaking the ordained mealtime silence.</p><p>The Brethren's Room displays a meetinghouse bench made in New Hampshire in 1830, a graceful rocking chair and two candlestands, one in the snake-foot and one in the spider-foot style -- two of the finest pieces in the show, Ms. Gould said.</p><p>''Each piece is totally simple and devoid of decoration but incredibly elegant,'' Mrs. Gould said. ''They took basic furniture forms from ''the world'' -- their term for nonbelievers -- and then refined them'' she continued. ''When you consider how much furniture they had to produce to furnish their dwelling houses, I don't know how they did it.''</p><p>The men's ''retiring rooms'' were usually built for four or six people and the massive case of drawers on display was no doubt meant to serve them all. Standing some eight feet tall, it is composed of eight large drawers topped by four smaller ones, with plain corners and base and simple wooden pulls.</p><p>Woodworking was considered men's work, and that included the now classic oval nesting boxes dubbed by Mrs. Gould ''the Tupperware of the day.'' Displayed in a range of colors -- blue, brown, red or tan -- they were designed for storing pantry goods and were among the Shakers' most popular sale items.</p><p>Shaker women made most of the clothing for the community, as well as cooking, cleaning, working in the dairy and poultry house and taking care of the elderly and the sick in the Nurse Shop. After the mid-19th century, as male membership decreased, the women played an increasingly important role in the community's economic ventures, even making sales trips to market their goods.</p><p>They developed new products, such as a special wrinkle-resistant  fabric, and distinctive clothing styles, like the hooded cloak with shoulder cape that is prominently exhibited alongside a simple, elegant go-to-meeting dress with white kerchief. The red wool ''Dorothy Cloak,'' named for Sister Dorothy Durgin who designed it, became so popular among ladies of fashion that it was worn by the wife of President Cleveland at his second inauguration.</p><p>By the end of the 19th century, women assumed responsibility for the chair business, one of the most successful Shaker ventures. The chairs, some of which are on display in a range of sizes, could be ordered with woven, taped or upholstered seats and backs.</p><p>The concluding section of the show compares traditional New England styles of furniture like candlestands, cases of drawers, ladder back chairs, wash stands and tables with the Shaker furniture and analyzes the similarities and the differences between them.</p><p>Mrs. Gould planned the show in conjunction with the society's curator, Susan Gunn, while Hancock Shaker Village was represented by Sharon Duane Koomler, the show's guest curator, and her assistant, Deborah Caiola.</p><p>''Hands to Work, Hearts to God''  will be on view at the Betts-Sturges-Blackmar House, 224 Danbury Road, Wilton, until Sept. 30. Exhibition hours are Monday through Thursday, 12 to 4 p.m., Sunday, 1 to 4.  Admission: $5 for adults, $3 for seniors and members of the historical society, free for children under 12.
