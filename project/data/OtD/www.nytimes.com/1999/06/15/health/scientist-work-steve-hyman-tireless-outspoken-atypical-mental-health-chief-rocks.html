Other psychiatrists who had filled that post were clinical psychiatrists. But Dr. Hyman, though he saw patients one morning a week, was a bench scientist at heart, at home with pipette and petri dish, deeply immersed in the molecular underpinnings of addiction and mood disorders. And he was only 43, much younger than previous directors.  ">

But Dr. Hyman, though he saw patients one morning a week, was a bench scientist at heart, at home with pipette and petri dish, deeply immersed in the molecular underpinnings of addiction and mood disorders. And he was only 43, much younger than previous directors.</p><p>There were other anomalies. He had little administrative experience. The interdisciplinary Mind, Brain and Behavior program he ran at Harvard University could hardly compare to a Government agency with a budget close to $900 million. Nor did he walk and talk much like a Washington bureaucrat. Bearded, genial and often missing a tie, he answered direct questions directly, thrived on intellectual argument, could discourse as fluently upon Descartes as upon dopamine receptors, and he had an alarming habit of speaking his mind, even when what he had to say was unpopular.</p><p>Yet it was these very attributes that convinced Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, that Dr. Hyman was the person for job, though some doubted the wisdom of the appointment.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A revolution was taking place in the neurosciences, advances in genetics and technologies like PET and M.R.I. scanning offering unparalleled opportunities for understanding the workings of the human brain. But psychiatry, Dr. Varmus felt, had been slow to take advantage of these new tools. The mental health institute was trailing behind when, as the nation's major underwriter of research on mental illness, it should have been leading the way.</p><p>What was needed, he thought, was a leader who was younger, in touch with the cutting edge of molecular science, someone who could bring together mind and brain and had a strong commitment to public health. ''I was searching for somebody out of the ordinary,'' Dr. Varmus said. ''Steve was extraordinary.''</p><p>Fast forward: it is close to 90 degrees in the director's office. The ventilation system in the institute's shiny new headquarters still does not work properly. But Dr. Hyman does not seem to notice.</p><p>He has just emerged from a meeting and will soon run to a job candidate's colloquium, followed by more meetings and two  precious, late afternoon hours spent in his lab. An official dinner, the latest in an endless series, means it will be late when he finally goes home to his family. His staff says that he seems tireless: that they are used to receiving E-mails he wrote at 3 A.M., that he recently gave a lecture an hour after breaking his leg on the ski slopes. ''Nobody was surprised,'' said Dr. David Shore, the institute's associate director of clinical research. ''Nothing stops him.''</p><p>Three years into his tenure, there are many who believe Dr. Hyman has proved the perfect antidote for a flagging institute, exerting strong leadership at a time when mental health is attracting unprecedented public attention. At the White House Conference on Mental Health last week, President Clinton announced the start of a $7.3 million institute study of the prevalence and severity of mental disorders in the United States.</p><p>Dr. Hyman's supporters use terms like ''tough but fair'' to describe him. They credit him with raising the scientific bar for research, taking strong stands on issues like psychiatric research ethics, serving as an eloquent ambassador on Capitol Hill, building bridges between basic scientists and clinical researchers, and extending a welcoming hand to advocacy groups, like the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.</p><p>''Steve has been refreshingly open and available, not only accepting critical feedback but actually looking for it,'' said Laurie Flynn, executive director of the alliance. ''I would not have expected this from someone who was a classic bench scientist. He has stepped up to the plate.''</p><p>He has also irritated more than a few people in the process. Some longtime researchers have been encouraged to seek work elsewhere. Well-known investigators who once had their grant applications rubber stamped now find they must actively defend the importance of their work. ''It's not enough with Steve to say 'Oh, these people are doing cutting-edge research and we've been funding them for 20 years, so let's fund them,' '' said one institute official.</p><p>Even close colleagues are not immune.  Dr. Charles Nemeroff, chairman of psychiatry at Emory University School of Medicine and a member of the institute's National Advisory Mental Health Council, who supports Dr. Hyman, recalled a grant application he submitted last year. ''I'm as close to him as anybody,'' Dr. Nemeroff said, ''and he looked me right in the eye and said, 'We're not going to fund this.' ''</p><p>Dr. Hyman's critics are happy to list their complaints, though few will do so on the record. They assert that his conception of psychiatry is too narrow, limited to molecular genetics on one hand and ''cookie cutter'' clinical drug trials on the other. That he has dismantled the institute's internal research program. They think that when advocacy groups criticized the ethics of studies involving human subjects, he should have defended the field and its researchers  instead of halting 29 studies and establishing a Federal committee to oversee all experimental protocols. ''Why is it that only N.I.M.H. is putting in this extra level of bureaucratic review?'' asked Dr. Donald Klein, director of research at New York State Psychiatric Institute.</p><p>Dr. Hyman, others suggest, is ambitious, a ''Varmus clone,'' who hopes to inherit the institutes' top job.</p>                </div>
