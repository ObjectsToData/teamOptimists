He has a nice apartment, not far from where he used to beg for change on Avenue A. He has a huge recording contract as a singer, which promises to make him a real -- and really rich -- rock-and-roll god.</p><p>But some things haven't changed. He still does his own hair (which means never washing it and keeping it nice and crusty with lots of Aqua Net.) He still dresses like Elvis on acid and looks like a walking feather duster (6 foot 4, 135 pounds). And he is just about as bemused by his success now as when MTV and its viewers plucked him from obscurity last April, one of about 4,000 people who competed for a job as an on-air personality.</p><p>''What can I say, man?'' says Mr. Camp (he still laughs when people call him this). ''I'm an extremely lucky, lucky, lucky guy.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>But in a rare swoop into introspection, he will also admit: ''I went through a time when it really started working on me. I kind of started checking myself. It was like, 'Wait a minute, why are all these people into me?' ''</p><p>There is indeed no shortage of people into Mr. Camp, 19. He has never really distinguished himself at anything, except being himself, but he is now pursued by modeling agencies, film producers, fashion designers and platoons of heavily pierced teen-age girls who gather outside MTV's Times Square offices.</p><p>When he talks about the benefits of minor celebrity, though, Mr. Camp does not mention material things.</p><p>He says that the most important perc for a guy who grew up disaffected, outlandishly dressed and addicted to Alice Cooper in tiny Granby, Conn., is that fame ''gives you almost a license to look funny.''</p><p>''You know what I mean? Before, people looked at me and they were like, 'Aw man, who are you to look like that? Cut your hair!' Now they're like, 'Hey man, he's on TV!' ''</p><p>Preparing for a recent interview at MTV's studios, with a publicist and his manager in tow, Mr. Camp folded his lanky frame into a love seat. He seemed like someone well accustomed to being steered from media event to media event. Until asked a question, he smiled quizzically and looked around the room.</p><p>But when he started talking, he sounded like someone who not so long ago was cadging nights on friends' sofas and scrounging for food.</p><p>''Nothing better than a nice comfy chair,'' he said, stretching his legs.</p><p>Surveying the finger food spread out on the table for MTV guests, he shook his head: ''Quite frankly, I've got to get on them about this. Cheese and crackers? Who wants that? Before, they'd have caviar and shrimp. I swear to God.''</p><p>Mr. Camp -- who hands over his crown on Saturday, when MTV viewers choose a new amateur ''video jockey'' -- has learned a lot in his year on the air. First, it's a bad idea to lie to reporters.</p><p>AFTER winning the contest, he said in interviews that his father was a roofing contractor and that his parents were divorced. It turns out his parents are quite together and his father is chairman of the humanities department at the University of Hartford. (His mother is an elementary school official.) Mr. Camp graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School, a prep school in Windsor, Conn., before hitting the road and winding up in the East Village.</p><p>Mr. Camp's parents were not happy about the fibs, especially his father. ''He's just from another planet,'' Mr. Camp said, then paused. ''Or I'm from another planet.''</p><p>''At the time I said all that stuff,'' he explained, ''I didn't really know why I said it all. I know a lot of kids who do that. They're like, 'I'm from San Francisco,' and you're like, 'Oh man, you're from Levittown.' '' It was his way -- and the way of a lot of wayward teen-agers in the so-called punk traveler scene -- to make their lives sound cooler, he said.</p><p>Partly because of the fabrications, and also because he smelled so bad back then, MTV executives didn't know quite what to make of the new ''talent'' viewers had chosen.</p><p>''We trusted him enough and our producers trusted him enough that he wasn't going to do anything completely embarrassing,'' said Dave Sirulnick, the executive vice president of news and production. But he added quickly, ''He got close to that line a few times.''</p><p>One thing was undeniable: Viewers liked to watch him. They seemed to see him as a kind of bell-bottomed avatar of pure rock-and-roll spirit, which some critics complain MTV has lost. ''If he was not on television,'' Mr. Sirulnick said, ''I do believe that this is the way he would still be walking around looking.''</p><p>In the end, Mr. Camp's fame brought another nice change: he talks to his mom and dad now, ''or to my dad through my mom,'' and he's in therapy.</p><p>He has very little time to hang out on sidewalks anymore. He carries a beeper, and his days are packed with appearances and rehearsals for a tour to promote his star-studded record. (He told the producers that he would love to work with Stevie Nicks, and the next thing he knew, voila, she was in the studio with him.)</p><p>''I'm busy, but it's all good stuff,'' he said. ''It's not like 'Jesse, you've got to mind the coals at 4 o'clock and stack the groceries at 5.' You get to do a TV show at 4 o'clock, man, then get to meet some cool dude from a paper, and hang out and chill and get your photo taken.''</p><p>''And I'm like, 'Oh man, I'm a workaholic.'
