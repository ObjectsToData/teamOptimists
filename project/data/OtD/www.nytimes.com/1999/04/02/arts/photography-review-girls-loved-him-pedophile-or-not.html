    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="''His were sad, scrawny little nymphets, bedraggled and half-undressed, or rather semi-undraped, as if participating in some dusty and dreadful charade,'' said Vladimir Nabokov, the Russian translator of Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' Nabokov noticed ''a pathetic affinity'' between Carroll, who photographed little girls clothed and naked, and Humbert Humbert, the pedophilic narrator of his own ''Lolita.''     But was Carroll a pedophile? As you walk through ''Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis Carroll Centenary Exhibition,'' organized by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin to mark his death in 1898 and now at the Equitable Gallery in Manhattan, the question seems oddly irrelevant. What is most startling, and attractive, in his portraits of girls is not what he saw in them but what they saw in him.  ">

	data-description="''His were sad, scrawny little nymphets, bedraggled and half-undressed, or rather semi-undraped, as if participating in some dusty and dreadful charade,'' said Vladimir Nabokov, the Russian translator of Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' Nabokov noticed ''a pathetic affinity'' between Carroll, who photographed little girls clothed and naked, and Humbert Humbert, the pedophilic narrator of his own ''Lolita.''     But was Carroll a pedophile? As you walk through ''Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis Carroll Centenary Exhibition,'' organized by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin to mark his death in 1898 and now at the Equitable Gallery in Manhattan, the question seems oddly irrelevant.

As you walk through ''Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis Carroll Centenary Exhibition,'' organized by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin to mark his death in 1898 and now at the Equitable Gallery in Manhattan, the question seems oddly irrelevant. What is most startling, and attractive, in his portraits of girls is not what he saw in them but what they saw in him.</p><p>''Lewis Carroll . . . came to our country home to photograph the children,'' wrote Dymphna Ellis, one of the children Carroll photographed. She added: ''I feel sure I was a 'favorite.' He made every child that. He developed the photographs in our cellar . . . I remember the mess and the mystery . . . We cried when he went away . . . We were absolutely fearless with him. We felt he was one of us, and on our side against all the grown-ups.''</p><p>These don't sound like the words of a victim of childhood seduction. But something in them is still alarming: cellar, mess, mystery, fearless. The words make you think that whatever Carroll and his little subjects were up to, it was exciting and seductive for all concerned. They were co-conspirators.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The photographs are the evidence. From the looks of them, these little girls weren't worried about the Big Bad Wolf. Even Carroll's photograph of Agnes Grace Weld posing as Little Red Riding Hood doesn't suggest that. She is intense, penetrating and focused as she emerges from the woods with a basket of goodies.</p><p>The exhibition vigorously inoculates the viewer against the idea that Carroll was a pedophile. It devotes more space to Carroll's pictures of family, friends and colleagues than to those he called his child friends. It shows none of his nude pictures of girls and only one photograph of Alice Liddell, Carroll's favorite girl and the saucy inspiration for ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.'' It includes testimonials from the women Carroll photographed as children: they adored him.</p><p>What emerges instead is something even more unsettling. The children in the photographs, in striking contrast to the grown-ups, are bold, sultry, mischievous and seductive. They seem as eager to please him as he was to please them. They appealed to him, in both senses of the word.</p><p>What electrified them so? There is a hint in Carroll's letters to them. The exhibition includes a letter he wrote to Rosamond Langbridge upbraiding Rosamond's big sister Gladys for being ''wanting in businesslike habits.'' (He had asked Gladys if the three sisters would like to divide a gift of six different books among themselves, and she had neglected to specify a desired distribution.) Carroll's letter, playfully alluding to a certain grasping disposition in Gladys and referring Rosamond to ''Blackstone's Treatise on the Just Claims of Younger Sisters,'' gently teases Rosamond into his world with a brew of logic, scolding, meddling and silliness.</p><p>Carroll apparently worked an even stronger seduction with photography. He brought out something in the girls that was, for want of a better word, sexual.</p><p>This exhibition includes the famous photograph of Alice Liddell as a beggar girl in ripped clothes addressing the viewer with an all-too-frank gaze. And there is Irene MacDonald standing in her nightie with a mirror and brush, looking mightily exasperated and petulant. The caption is ''It Won't Come Smooth.'' A few of the pictures bear the children's signatures at the bottom, some straining to be neat and proper and others obviously untrained, which only adds to the ragtag excitement. You see Maria White, the niece of a porter at Oxford, sitting like a good girl in a flouncy skirt holding a dead plant. Her restraint is belied by the stray marks between the letters of her name.</p><p>What about Carroll's treatment of adults? A lecturer in mathematics at Oxford, Carroll obviously did not reserve all his mock scolding for children.</p><p>He also sent his adult friends logic puzzles, riddles and notes, some of which are included in the show.</p><p>For example, he composed a ditty about all the Oxford professors who ''might, could, would, or should'' have attended a meeting on academic standards. It begins: ''A is for Aclana who'd physic the masses, B is for Brodie who swears by the gasses, C is for Conington, constant to Horace, D is for Donkin, who integrates for us.'' This A, B, C is at least as childish as anything Carroll wrote for children.</p><p>Yet Carroll's taunting, it seems, never elicited the same kind of intensity in grown-ups that it did in children. He got gentleness (in a photograph of his father reading); eccentricity (in a photograph of his brother, Skeffington Hume Dodgson, dressed in fishing gear and looking as if he's expecting to get wet); domestic tranquillity (in a photograph of two women named Alice Donkin), and youthful pensiveness (in a photograph of Robert Bickersteth leaning on a column). But a search for that raw, insolent look invariably lands the viewer in front of the kids.</p><p>There are some exceptions, some pictures of intense grown-ups. But tellingly, they involve fathers and daughters. In one, George MacDonald, a stammerer like Carroll, sits with an open book while his eldest daughter, Lilia Scott MacDonald, leans on him. This photograph is all sly reversals. The father's arm is around the girl's waist, fiddling with her belt as a child might. The girl's hand is around her father's shoulder, as if she were the adult. Their glances are reversed, too. She is staring fixedly, sternly, at the book he should be reading. And he is giving Carroll that look so many little girls gave him: mischievous, knowing and stubborn.</p><p>''Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis Carroll Centenary Exhibition'' remains at the Equitable Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 52d Street, in Manhattan, (212) 554-4818, through April 24.</p><p>Photos: Lewis Carroll photographs: The novelist George MacDonald and his daughter Lilia, above, in 1863, and Alexandra Kitchin, above right, in ''Rosy Dreams and Slumbers Light,'' 1873. All were friends of Carroll. (Photographs from the Equitable Gallery)</p>                </div>
