                    <p>It is often challenging and ghostly work, evaluating the wishes of a writer who is dead, deciding whether a hidden manuscript is worthy of display and therefore should be published. For authors who are important or popular, or both, there is pressure to keep the property alive, their bodies of work available and visible, to generate not only art but cash. To do so, there has to be something new. Enter the literary executor, and lo and behold, bingo, what was in the vaults is now on the bookshelves.</p><p>Maybe even if that's not what the author wanted.</p><p>The excerpt of Ralph Ellison's second novel this week in The New Yorker reminds us that this summer there will be two major posthumous literary events, the novel Ellison had worked on for 40 years and the publication of a new Ernest Hemingway novel 38 years after his death. Neither would have occurred without a truly resolute literary executor, a role that is usually almost underground in its covertness but has popped to the foreground because of the attack on the publication of the Hemingway book by Joan Didion.</p><p>Like only dictators or co-op boards, literary (or artistic) executors have the absolute power to render, without restraint, the property they superintend. They usually control only the writer's or painter's or  composer's creative work, not the remainder of the estate as well. Thus they have the power to sift the work, edit it, hide it away or hang it, sell it, open it only to scholars, donate it to university libraries, have it published or performed. Or for that matter to put a match to it.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This spectral wedding between the executor and the dead writer often raises the question, if an author didn't finish the novel, is the novel publishable as the author's work? Is a de Kooning with half the canvas left unpainted a de Kooning? Or supposing the writer had every opportunity to finish and publish the work before his or her death, and didn't, then can't -- shouldn't -- we assume that the writer didn't want that work published, and aren't we then required to honor that? Who owns the work? The artist or the public?</p><p>In Ms. Didion's recent essay in The New Yorker, she eloquently argued that the novel to be published by Scribner in July under Hemingway's name, titled ''True at First Light,'' was not true Hemingway; rather, it was cobbled out of a mountain of words he had written but clearly had not wanted published, or he would have had it published.</p><p>''This was a man to whom words mattered,'' Ms. Didion wrote. ''He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them. . . . His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.'' She described this constructing of a Hemingway novel by the author's son Patrick, a literary executor, with the help of Scribner as ''the systematic creation of a marketable product, a discrete body of work different in kind from, and in fact tending to obscure, the body of work published by Hemingway in his lifetime.''</p><p>Well, that's certainly an absolutist viewpoint. To which Patrick Hemingway replied: ''I think it's a very valid argument. The only trouble is he did leave the material; he didn't destroy it. Perhaps he didn't intend to have it published, but when people are dead it's hard to know what they want. Somebody, some day, was going to publish these words, and I had particular insights about this particular work.''</p><p>Charles Scribner, an editor whose great-great-grandfather founded the publishing house, said that he had ''no doubt that Hemingway intended the unfinished work to be published posthumously.'' He continued: ''He knew an intelligent public would understand the difference between books he lived to see in print and those he didn't.''</p><p>Hemingway did leave instructions not to publish his correspondence (though they were ignored); he left instructions not to publish the stories he wrote before he became what he considered a good writer (though that directive was ignored, too). It would seem he knew what he wanted published and what he didn't, which adds muscle to Ms. Didion's essay. (The New Yorker also plans to excerpt the Hemingway novel.)</p><p>Mr. Ellison's second novel could also be debated. Ms. Didion said of it, ''It's not written until it's written.'' But at least in his case there is evidence to believe that he would have wanted it published. His ''Invisible Man'' (Random House) almost immediately became acknowledged as a classic of American and even world literature when it burst upon us in 1952. His second novel, ''Juneteenth,'' which was left unfinished when he died in 1994 and was excerpted this week, will be published by Random House in June. It was edited by his literary executor, John Callahan, professor of humanities at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore., who said, ''I was confronted with a real stack of manuscripts amounting to a huge unfinished saga in which there were a number of potential novels, one of which was 'Juneteenth.' ''</p><p>Mr. Callahan contends that every word in ''Juneteenth'' was written by Ellison and that all he did was use Ellison's notes to put the novel's parts in the sequence that the writer wanted. ''If Ellison had left instructions that he didn't want this unfinished work to ever be published. I wouldn't have done it, but he didn't, and he talked about the work, and Mrs. Ellison said she thought from their talks that he wanted it published.''</p><p>The history of publishing is full of what ifs. Eugene O'Neill asked his publisher, Random House, not to publish ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' for 25 years after his death, so his wife, Carlotta O'Neill, who made being his widow a vocation, gave it to Yale University Press, which published it within three years, resurrecting the playwright's reputation and value.</p><p>''She probably did it for money, but if she didn't, he might not have been resurrected,'' said Barbara Gelb, an O'Neill biographer. Money certainly lurks behind the shoulder of every executor. Sessalee Hensley, fiction buyer for Barnes &amp; Noble, said the Ellison book would be ''a big event both in literature in general and African-American literature, and will be one of the two big books of June, a good healthy best seller,'' along with Thomas Harris's sequel to ''Silence of the Lambs.''</p><p>''The baby boomers are coming into economic power; they read Ellison and Hemingway in their formative years, so both really appeal to this generation,'' she said, adding: ''Every store will have a big stack of each. They'll be floor displays in all the stores.''</p><p>So, yes, we'd hardly know Kafka without his literary executor, and there is this literature thing with Hemingway and Ellison. But these new novels are also about those floor displays. The question of whether a dead artist owns his or her work becomes a detail.</p>                </div>
