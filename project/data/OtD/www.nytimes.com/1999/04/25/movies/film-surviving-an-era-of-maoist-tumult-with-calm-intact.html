    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Wu Tianming is well acquainted with the whims of fortune: During the 1980's, as an acclaimed director, he headed Xian Film Studio, the cradle of the New Chinese Cinema, which burst upon the international scene with the force of a revelation. Less than a decade later, he was reduced to running a video store in Los Angeles.    Today, Mr. Wu, at 60, is once again working as a director in China. On a recent visit to New York, he looked back on these twists of fate with remarkable good humor. What's the secret of his equanimity? ''I'm very easy-going,'' he explained through a translator. ''I have no heart and no lungs.'' Meaning? ''I don't let things get to me. There's an old Chinese poem that says, 'If you've been through the big wave of the ocean, the quiet water of the river cannot disturb you anymore.' ''  ">

                    <p>Wu Tianming is well acquainted with the whims of fortune: During the 1980's, as an acclaimed director, he headed Xian Film Studio, the cradle of the New Chinese Cinema, which burst upon the international scene with the force of a revelation. Less than a decade later, he was reduced to running a video store in Los Angeles.</p><p>Today, Mr. Wu, at 60, is once again working as a director in China. On a recent visit to New York, he looked back on these twists of fate with remarkable good humor. What's the secret of his equanimity? ''I'm very easy-going,'' he explained through a translator. ''I have no heart and no lungs.'' Meaning? ''I don't let things get to me. There's an old Chinese poem that says, 'If you've been through the big wave of the ocean, the quiet water of the river cannot disturb you anymore.' ''</p><p>''The King of Masks,'' Mr. Wu's first film in a decade, opens in New York on May 9. Set in Sichuan province in the 1930's, it follows an itinerant street performer, Old Wang (Zhu Xu), who earns a meager living astounding crowds with his skill at ''changing faces.'' Using elaborate sleight of hand, practitioners of this folk art change masks as if by magic. Master Lliang (Zhao Zhigang), a celebrated female impersonator in a local opera company, admires Wang's artistry, but Wang declines the offer to join Lliang's wealthy troupe. Instead, he longs for a male heir to inherit the secrets of his skill. On the black market, Wang meets Doggie (Zhou Ren-ying), a 7-year-old put up for sale by his destitute father. An ecstatic Wang buys him, but soon discovers that his new ''grandson'' is really a girl, an inappropriate heir and a worthless creature on the scale of China's social values. There his troubles begin. Doggie and Wang suffer extreme misfortune, but they're bound by love and by their common fate as outcasts.</p><p>A simple, sensitive film, ''The King of Masks'' draws upon Mr. Wu's deep understanding of rural Chinese culture. ''He's a country boy,'' said Donald Gibbs, a professor of Chinese language, literature and film at the University of California at Davis, where Mr. Wu has been a guest lecturer. ''He's very earthy and unpretentious. He speaks the language and understands the heart of mainstream country China in a way that city folks never will. That's his gift, that's who he is, and his films reflect that.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Wu was born in China's Appalachia, the poverty-stricken, agrarian north of Shaanxi province. He began his career in the province's capital as an actor at Xian Film Studio; in 1966, when the Cultural Revolution short-circuited his plans to study film in Beijing, he spent years at home reading about filmmaking in secret.</p><p>''Many educational books were destroyed, but film manuals were spared, because film didn't seem to matter much,'' he said with some amusement. ''And then, there were so many books, the Cultural Revolution people could not burn them all.''</p><p>During those dark years, Mr. Wu's father, a former revolutionary and devoted government official, died shortly after being jailed on trumped-up charges of treason. Mr. Wu himself suffered public humiliation. In his 1987 film, ''The Old Well,'' a young man dies in a tragic accident; party officials attend the funeral to report allegations of his licentious behavior. ''That's what those times were like,'' Mr. Wu said. ''People would even accuse the dead.''</p><p>When the Cultural Revolution subsided, Mr. Wu was finally able to attend the Beijing Film Academy. After graduating in 1976, he returned to Xian and received his first solo directing credit for ''River Without Buoys'' (1982), a spectacular popular success about three men who share their experiences of the Cultural Revolution as they pilot a raft down the Pushui River. Two years later he made ''Life,'' which focuses on a village schoolteacher who is torn between his intellectual urban aspirations and his love for a peasant woman.</p><p>'' 'Life's' appeal was so broad,'' Mr. Gibbs recalled, ''that intellectuals and city people loved it, and peasants would place gifts of vegetables and poultry at the door of Mr. Wu's studio with notes saying, 'Please let us know what happened to the characters.' ''</p><p>As the head of Xian Film Studio, Mr. Wu also promoted artistic freedom; he was open to the fresh ideas and daring approaches of younger directors. His film ''The Old Well,'' about a man striving to find a new source of water for a village nestled high in stony mountains, starred a young actor named Zhang Yimou. Mr. Zhang is better known as a member of the ''Fifth Generation'' of Chinese directors, who got their start at Xian Film Studio and went on to capture world attention. Films like Mr. Zhang's ''Red Sorghum'' (1988), a sensuous rural epic culminating in the Japanese invasion; Tian Zhuangzhuang's ''Horse Thief'' (1986), an austerely beautiful film about Tibetan nomads in the 1920's, and Chen Kaige's ''King of Children'' (1987), which focused on a schoolteacher sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, were all produced at Xian. Their spectacular visuals and unorthodox subject matter reflected a radical break with prevailing codes of Socialist Realism.</p><p>''The Fifth Generation drove home the idea that the official Socialist version of reality was not only boring but a lie,'' said Xudong Zhang, a Rockefeller Fellow in the humanities at New York University and a specialist in Chinese cinema. ''They tried to uncover a deeper reality by inventing a new cinematic language, a new visual culture, and by turning our gaze to truths that had been concealed. Their utopian energy was directed against an ossified state bureaucracy. These Fifth Generation directors were not exactly political dissidents, however; for a brief period in the 1980's, the critique of Chinese tradition in their films fit in well with Deng's ideology of reform.''</p><p>MR. WU was visiting the United States in the spring of 1989 when the events of Tiananmen Square unfolded. He remained in this country for five years. Returning to China to make ''The King of Masks'' in 1994, he found a culture in the throes of economic and social transformation. ''I don't understand why, all of a sudden, Chinese people seem to have grown so cold,'' he said. ''That's why I wanted to make this film, to show that love and warmth are more important than tradition or money.''</p><p>China's new entrepreneurial spirit has had mixed results for the nation's vanguard cinema, which now finds itself competing with Hollywood products. Like many recent films by Chinese directors, ''The King of Masks'' was primarily financed by nonmainland sources, in this case the Hong Kong-based Shao Brothers film studio. Bottom-line concerns have not prevented the rise of a ''Sixth Generation'' of Chinese directors, however, whose documentary style and focus on private, ephemeral experience stand in sharp contrast to that of their predecessors.</p><p>Meanwhile, the irrepressible Mr. Wu keeps working. He has just completed China's most popular television soap opera ever, and is directing another -- 36 episodes about a century in the lives of three families living near the Yellow River. (He expects about 32 episodes to remain when the censors finish their work.) Like Old Wang in ''The King of Masks,'' he changes faces but maintains a deep simplicity.</p><p>''That's the film's broader message,'' he said. ''In life in general, you have to keep changing faces in order to survive.''</p><p>Photo: The director Wu Tianming at the Parker Meridien Hotel in Manhattan recently.
