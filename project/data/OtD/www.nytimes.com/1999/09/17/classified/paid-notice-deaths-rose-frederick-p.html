Frederick Rose will have a cherished place in our memory and that of the University he loved so well, as a reflection of his lifetime of devoted service, visionary guidance and great generosity. Since his graduation from Yale in 1944 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and throughout an active life as an entrepreneur, builder, volunteer and philanthropist in New York City, Frederick Rose remained close to Yale and staunchly committed to the fulfillment of its mission in adherence to the highest standard of excellence. He helped guide the creation of the Association of Yale Alumni and chaired its first Board of Governors; he was a member of the University Council; and he served as a successor trustee on the Yale Corporation, the University's governing body, where he was a leading supporter of the University's building renovation program. He supported teaching and learning at Yale through the creation of endowed professorships, scholarships at the Schools of Architecture and Music, the AYA's Community Service Fellowships, the Humanities in Medicine program and other projects. His many awards and honors include the Yale Medal and the Medal of Honor from the Yale Science and Engineering Society. Yale bestowed an honorary degree on this distinguished and beloved alumnus in May 1998, saluting him thus: ''Builder and philanthropist, you have left your mark indelibly on your university and your city...We take great pride in your service to scholarship and the arts as we confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.''

	data-description="ROSE-Frederick P., master builder and creative philanthropist, son of Samuel B. and Belle B. Rose, died at home on Wednesday, September 15, 1999. Husband of Sandra Priest Rose, father of Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose; brother of Daniel and Elihu; grandfather of Ariel, Rachel and Sarah leaves a legacy of enormous love, warm friendships and immense generosity. His joy of life was expressed in his work and play. The service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple, 255 Mamaroneck Road, Scarsdale, NY, on Sunday, September 19, 1999 at 10AM. The family requests no flowers, and is not receiving visitors.    ROSE-Frederick P. The Officers and Fellows of Yale University on the sad occasion of the death of Frederick Phineas Rose express heartfelt sympathy to his devoted family members, his wife, Sandra Priest Rose; his brothers, Daniel and Elihu Rose; and his children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam Rose. Frederick Rose will have a cherished place in our memory and that of the University he loved so well, as a reflection of his lifetime of devoted service, visionary guidance and great generosity. Since his graduation from Yale in 1944 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and throughout an active life as an entrepreneur, builder, volunteer and philanthropist in New York City, Frederick Rose remained close to Yale and staunchly committed to the fulfillment of its mission in adherence to the highest standard of excellence. He helped guide the creation of the Association of Yale Alumni and chaired its first Board of Governors; he was a member of the University Council; and he served as a successor trustee on the Yale Corporation, the University's governing body, where he was a leading supporter of the University's building renovation program. He supported teaching and learning at Yale through the creation of endowed professorships, scholarships at the Schools of Architecture and Music, the AYA's Community Service Fellowships, the Humanities in Medicine program and other projects. His many awards and honors include the Yale Medal and the Medal of Honor from the Yale Science and Engineering Society. Yale bestowed an honorary degree on this distinguished and beloved alumnus in May 1998, saluting him thus: ''Builder and philanthropist, you have left your mark indelibly on your university and your city...We take great pride in your service to scholarship and the arts as we confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.'' We mourn the passing of a true and devoted friend. Richard C. Levin, President The Officers and Fellows of Yale University    ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The Trustees and Staff of The New York Public Library are deeply saddened at the passing of Frederick Rose, beloved husband of our esteemed Trustee Sandra Priest Rose, and our dear friend and benefactor.

At The New York Public Library, Mr. and Mrs. Rose were responsible for the restoration of the Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose Main Reading Room, the symbolic heart of the institution, named for their children. In addition, they endowed the position of the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Chief Librarian of the General Research Division. Deeply committed to The Branch Libraries, the Roses also made possible the rehabilitation of the Library's Yorkville and Aguilar branches. Mr. Rose's legacy to the Library is a permanent one and we will miss his warmth and vitality.

                    <p>ROSE-Frederick P., master builder and creative philanthropist, son of Samuel B. and Belle B. Rose, died at home on Wednesday, September 15, 1999. Husband of Sandra Priest Rose, father of Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose; brother of Daniel and Elihu; grandfather of Ariel, Rachel and Sarah leaves a legacy of enormous love, warm friendships and immense generosity. His joy of life was expressed in his work and play. The service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple, 255 Mamaroneck Road, Scarsdale, NY, on Sunday, September 19, 1999 at 10AM. The family requests no flowers, and is not receiving visitors.</p><p>ROSE-Frederick P. The Officers and Fellows of Yale University on the sad occasion of the death of Frederick Phineas Rose express heartfelt sympathy to his devoted family members, his wife, Sandra Priest Rose; his brothers, Daniel and Elihu Rose; and his children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam Rose. Frederick Rose will have a cherished place in our memory and that of the University he loved so well, as a reflection of his lifetime of devoted service, visionary guidance and great generosity. Since his graduation from Yale in 1944 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, and throughout an active life as an entrepreneur, builder, volunteer and philanthropist in New York City, Frederick Rose remained close to Yale and staunchly committed to the fulfillment of its mission in adherence to the highest standard of excellence. He helped guide the creation of the Association of Yale Alumni and chaired its first Board of Governors; he was a member of the University Council; and he served as a successor trustee on the Yale Corporation, the University's governing body, where he was a leading supporter of the University's building renovation program. He supported teaching and learning at Yale through the creation of endowed professorships, scholarships at the Schools of Architecture and Music, the AYA's Community Service Fellowships, the Humanities in Medicine program and other projects. His many awards and honors include the Yale Medal and the Medal of Honor from the Yale Science and Engineering Society. Yale bestowed an honorary degree on this distinguished and beloved alumnus in May 1998, saluting him thus: ''Builder and philanthropist, you have left your mark indelibly on your university and your city...We take great pride in your service to scholarship and the arts as we confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.'' We mourn the passing of a true and devoted friend. Richard C. Levin, President The Officers and Fellows of Yale University</p><p>ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The Trustees and Staff of The New York Public Library are deeply saddened at the passing of Frederick Rose, beloved husband of our esteemed Trustee Sandra Priest Rose, and our dear friend and benefactor. For decades, Mr. Rose was a leader and supporter of educational and cultural institutions in New York City, combining his great skills as builder, businessman, and advocate with exceptional acts of philanthropy. At The New York Public Library, Mr. and Mrs. Rose were responsible for the restoration of the Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose Main Reading Room, the symbolic heart of the institution, named for their children. In addition, they endowed the position of the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Chief Librarian of the General Research Division. Deeply committed to The Branch Libraries, the Roses also made possible the rehabilitation of the Library's Yorkville and Aguilar branches. Mr. Rose's legacy to the Library is a permanent one and we will miss his warmth and vitality. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sandy; to their children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam; to his brothers, Daniel and Elihu; and to the entire Rose family. Samuel C. Butler, Chairman Brooke Astor, Honorary Chairman Andrew Heiskell, Elizabeth Rohatyn, Marshall Rose, Chairmen Emeritii Paul LeClerc, President Trustees and Staff of The New York Public Library</p><p>ROSE-Frederick P. All of us at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. deeply mourn the death of one of our most beloved friends, leaders, and benefactors, Frederick P. Rose. Unmatched in loyalty and commitment, Fred served Lincoln Center in every way imaginable: As a member of the Board of Directors since 1984, later as Vice Chairman of the Board, and on myriad committees and councils. Fred committed himself fully to every important Lincoln Center program and project. His vision, professional guidance, and unparalleled generosity were instrumental in the construction of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center, named after his father and uncle. For over a decade, he served on the Lincoln Center Real Estate and Construction Council where he was twice honored. Moreover, he was the recipient of the Lincoln Center Laureate, the greatest distinction we bestow. In memory of his mother, Belle, his philanthropy showed a special concern for people with visual disabilities. He also had a profound desire to bring the performing arts to the broadest possible audiences through his funding of Live from Lincoln Center telecasts. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Sandra, a full partner in his philanthropic and civic endeavors, and to his children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam, and to their friends and associates. We will miss his friendship, wit, wisdom, and leadership. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.</p>                </div>
