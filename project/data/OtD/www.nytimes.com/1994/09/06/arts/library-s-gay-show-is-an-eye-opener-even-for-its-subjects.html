Goldberg, a 38-year-old psychologist from Philadelphia, who cried as he walked through the hall. "I was overwhelmed by the exhibit and also by where it was."</p>                </div>

                    <p>With their tears and laughter, rapt attention and effusive comments, many visitors plainly convey the sense of being ennobled and enfranchised. They see their own lives reflected in a chronicle of social, artistic and political change that has seldom been presented so vividly and perhaps never before in so august a setting.</p><p>"That the New York Public Library decided to do the exhibition is the strongest statement of all," said Fred Wasserman, one of three curators, with Molly McGarry and Mimi Bowling. "The New York Public Library has said: 'This is important. Your lives are real. This is history.' " Unorthodox Artifacts</p><p>It is history told through unorthodox artifacts, beginning with a blue neon "Stonewall" sign and banks of public telephones at which visitors can hear oral recollections of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar on Christopher Street, and of the nights in June 1969 when patrons battled the police rather than acquiesce to another raid.</p><p>While this event is regarded as a watershed in homosexuals' struggle for equal rights, "Becoming Visible" stretches decades further. There is a red AIDS ribbon from the 1980's, a "Lavender Menace" T-shirt from 1970 and a "blue discharge" issued to an Army private in 1943 for "undesirable habits or traits of character."</p><p>There is a copy of Fire!!, a literary magazine from the mid-1920's Harlem Renaissance. In it is an erotic poem by Bruce Nugent that the curators call the first published piece about homosexuality by an African-American author. There is a watercolor by Charles Demuth of men gathered at a downtown bathhouse, reportedly the Lafayette, the most popular such gay rendezvous at the time of the painting: 1918.</p><p>"For both straight and gay people, the exhibition has brought to light a notion of history that they never knew existed," Ms. Bowling said.</p><p>If the show has a center, it is probably under a mirrored ball, where a console offers musical selections from the 1920's through the 1990's.</p><p>As Dan Murphy found the other day, it is possible one moment to hear Gloria Gaynor sing the 1979 disco anthem "I Will Survive," then turn a corner to face a case of AIDS memorabilia: announcements and programs for memorial services, a diary, a medical treatment journal and a plaque dedicated to Luisito from Ramon ("Those who loved you will never forget you.")</p><p>Mr. Murphy, who lives in Jersey City, said that because he reached adulthood after AIDS, "that whole 70's being-in-the-closet concept is so foreign." He added, "I came to see what our hidden history is."</p><p>At that moment, Stevye Knowles, a 52-year-old lawyer from Brooklyn, was making a discovery of her own as she read a broadside from 1977. "Gwen, come here," she called to her daughter. "Here's a listing for Dykes and Tykes!" Turning to another visitor, she explained, "It's a piece of our history."</p><p>Ms. Knowles was active in Dykes and Tykes, an organization of lesbian mothers and their children, lovers, friends and allies. She and her daughter went to the library after a friend spotted them in a 4-by-8-foot photograph taken by Bettye Lane at a 1978 demonstration.</p><p>There is no mistaking Gwen Knowles's grin, even 16 years later. But Mr. Wasserman has noticed that "people see themselves in the pictures even if it's not them."</p><p>"That's the kind of universality they're feeling," he said. Setting a Record</p><p>In its first week, which coincided with the Gay Games and the Stonewall march, the exhibition drew 17,258 visitors; 5,540 of them on the Saturday before the march, exceeding records set in 1993-94 by "Dead Sea Scrolls: Ancient Civilization/ Modern Scholarship." In recent weeks, library officials say, attendance has averaged 1,000 people a day.</p><p>Visitors from 39 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 36 foreign countries have signed a register at the entrance. Most comments are enthusiastic; many are poignantly personal. A few people have left messages of anger, disgust or irritation. One visitor from California suggested a "warning for families with young children," presumably because the show includes explicitly erotic images.</p><p>Last year, the National Endowment for the Humanities turned down the library's request for a $30,000 planning grant. Mr. Wasserman said the agency cited a need for "more historical context" and expressed concern that the show would be "too celebratory." This came in spite of peer reviews that were "laudatory in the extreme," Ms. Bowling said. (A spokesman said the endowment did not comment on unsuccessful applications as a matter of policy.)</p><p>The show was underwritten by Pinewood Foundation, the Stonewall Community Foundation Inc. and some 30 individuals and foundations. The library would not disclose the cost.</p><p>Many visitors hope "Becoming Visible" will travel around the country or abroad. "It should be seen in Oregon, where rights are endangered," wrote Lizzi Katz of Portland. But the logistical and financial hurdles are daunting.</p><p>Another frequent request, for a book based on the exhibition, may materialize. Jed Mattes, a literary agent working with the library, said the proposal had already been seen by a dozen or so publishers, and they greeted it with "almost universally positive response."</p><p>Photo: "Becoming Visible" tells history through unorthodox artifacts and telephones on which visitors can hear recollections about the Stonewall Inn.
