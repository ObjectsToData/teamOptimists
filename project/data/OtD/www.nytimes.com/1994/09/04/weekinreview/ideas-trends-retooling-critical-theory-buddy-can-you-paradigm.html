But the passing of theory is more than an evolutionary change: It is the resolution of a significant engagement in the culture wars.</p><p>Recent books by such authors as Camille Paglia, Dinesh D'Souza, Roger Kimball and David Lehman have portrayed theory as the obscurantist, jargon-filled, self-indulgent and sometimes downright meaningless noodlings of the superannuated '60s radicals that allegedly dominate the academy. Sheldon Hackney, in his confirmation hearings last year as chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, gave legitimacy to this view, describing poststructuralism as a form of "intellectual political correctness."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Especially pilloried has been the school known as deconstruction, which holds among other things that authors have virtually no control over the texts they produce. Mr. Lehman's "Signs of the Times" viewed the revelation that the late Paul de Man (the chief American proponent of deconstruction) had contributed anti-Semitic articles to a Belgian collaborationist periodical during World War II as evidence that deconstruction is inherently ahistorical and ultimately immoral.</p><p>Recent years have seen of books called "In the Wake of Theory," "After Poststructuralism," and "Beyond Deconstruction," and last year's convention of the Modern Language Association featured a panel called "Posttheory." Patricia Meyer Spacks, a professor of English at the University of Virginia and the current president of the M.L.A., says, "Contrary to the general view in the press that the profession is dominated by it, deconstruction is pretty much dead -- except for maybe one or two people at Yale." One Conference Set the Fashion</p><p>The origin of theory's reign can be traced fairly precisely to a 1966 Johns Hopkins conference called "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man," where French theorists like Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes met their chief American disciples, de Man and J. Hillis Miller. In short order, deconstruction, in one form or another, became all the rage.</p><p>( Undergraduate classes, where most Americans are exposed to 'lit crit,' are by and large insulated from the winds of fashion and continue to be conducted in the traditional way -- close readings of great books.)</p><p>But where the New Criticism tended to look at a text as an inviolate, almost sacred object, with a meaning that existed deep within if only the reader was resourceful enough to get to it, the new theories were looser. Drawing on the doctrine of structuralism, which held that human behavior and creations were the product of deeply ingrained, not easily discernible patterns and structures, the new theories argued that meaning was ambiguous, socially constructed, frequently self-contradictory. So was the concept of the Great Author, which was seen as a once-useful, now outmoded fiction.</p><p>To the new theorists, a novel or poem was about the nature of language, society's patterns of oppression and power -- anything but the author's intentions. And while the traditional canon of poems, novels and stories was fine, one could also deconstruct nontraditional "texts," like comic books and buildings and movie stars.</p><p>A thousand theories bloomed. "In the late '60s, English departments had kind of bottomed out," says Jeffrey Williams, who teaches English at East Carolina University and organized the "Posttheory" panel at the M.L.A. "They were thought of as irrelevant. Theory could be seen as a way they were able to give themselves cachet." Part of theory's sexiness was its daunting difficulty. Where traditional literary criticism worked in terms of relatively accessible concepts like extended metaphor or irony, theory spoke of "intertextuality" and "discourse" and "hegemony." The intellectual groupies swooned.</p><p>Now that budgets are being pinched and academic departments are attempting to broaden their markets, obscurity has lost some of its appeal. Another difficulty is that many of the insights afforded by the new approaches have not proved conducive to further inquiry. "De Man's book 'Allegories of Reading' keeps getting back to the same notion, that texts are unreadable," Jeffrey Williams says. "It's a dead end. At a certain point you say, 'So what? Let's go on from here.' "</p><p>One popular current pursuit is loosely characterized as "cultural studies," an attempt to examine how literary texts are shaped by and serve to shape the cultures in which they are produced.Thus Stephen Greenblatt of the University of California at Berkeley cited both Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" and an obscure trial of a hermaphrodite in Normandy as evidence of the 16th century's confusion about gender. And Eric Lott, in a 1993 work called "Love and Theft," examined black-faced minstrel shows of the 19th century as representative of the social dynamics of working-class America.</p><p>Another trend, one that will be welcome to former English majors who have felt frozen out of the field by the difficulties of theory, is toward more accessible, belletristic writing styles. Such scholars as Henry Louis Gates, Frank Lentricchia, Alice Kaplan, Nancy Miller, Michael Berube, and Edward Said have all made a transition from sometimes impenetrable high theory to prose, often explicitly autobiographical in cast, that is suitable -- and intended -- for comparatively wide audiences.</p><p>Theory is still the subject of numerous debates in the academic journals, but most would agree that whatever its excesses and faults, it has irrevocably changed the way literature is viewed.  But the Memory Lingers On</p><p>"We're not reacting against theory," Mr. Williams says of scholars like himself who are trying to chart a future for the profession. "We're all schooled in theory -- it's an assumed thing."</p><p>Gerald Graff, a professor of English at the University of Chicago and the author of "Beyond the Culture Wars," "Professing Literature" and other books, says theory has been good for the profession, even in the trenches -- the undergraduate classrooms.</p><p>"It's changed the way we teach," he says. "We take less for granted. Now we ask students to think about why they read these books instead of other books. We ask them to think about their own lives, which is what the Greeks had in mind when they talked about self-consciousness."</p><p>Drawing.</p>                </div>
