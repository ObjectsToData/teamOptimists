As has been much noted, Mr. Burns sees the national pastime as the metaphorical successor to the Civil War; he believes that much of what has happened in the United States since 1865 -- the culture of racism, labor's struggles, the decline of cities and the changing roles of women and the media -- can be viewed through the prism of the game.</p><p>"Baseball is a constant reminder of a vast past and a precise mirror of who we are," says Mr. Burns, a perfectionist with a penchant for high-minded pronouncements that can sound earnest and pompous at the same time.</p><p>"Baseball" begins the first of its nine "innings" tonight at 8 on PBS. Parts 2 through 5 will be seen tomorrow through Thursday, followed by Nos. 6 through 9 next Sunday through Sept. 28. Spanning the sport's 250-year history -- and 18 1/2 hours of broadcast time -- the epic debunks the myth that Abner Doubleday created the game and profiles stars like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb and executives like A. G. Spalding and Branch Rickey. Mr. Burns examines the infamous fixing of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox and tracks the Brooklyn Dodgers from their rise from ignominy to their 1955 World Series victory over the New York Yankees and their move to Los Angeles in 1958. He traces the labor movement that once found players treated like indentured servants. But the central focus is an illuminating narrative about the game's legacy of racism, with Jackie Robinson, of course, playing the principal, Lincolnesque role.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"It's a gritty history that doesn't need to be sanitized," Mr. Burns said one evening last month, sitting cross-legged on a concrete bench just outside Central Park. He seems at least 15 years younger than 41, with a Dutch-boy haircut and a scraggly beard that give him the appearance of a graduate student raising money for his first film. His uniform of faded jeans, blue blazer, T-shirt and Reeboks accentuates the look. "I grew the beard to look older, so instead of looking 16 I look 18," he said.</p><p>Reaction to "Baseball," which cost more than $7 million to make, may age Mr. Burns, for various reasons. For all his technical virtuosity and love of the subject, skeptics may ask: Who does he think he is? He has composed an opus about a sport that is both old and contemporary, with much of the history close enough for many to remember -- and thus take issue with his presentation. The strike that began Aug. 12, and may wipe baseball out for this year, has crystallized a simmering anger among fans who are coming to regard players and owners as greedy, undeserving guardians of the game, a feeling that may spill over onto the documentary.</p><p>But a major concern is whether Mr. Burns has created 18 1/2 hours of nauseating nostalgia that has transformed the game into a metaphor for every zig and zag of the human condition.</p><p>"Nostalgia is a dead end," Mr. Burns said. "I despise nostalgia. Nostalgia is lazy. You have to separate nostalgia from history. This is history."</p><p>Early into his research for the series, Mr. Burns concluded that baseball was indelibly written into the history of the country, that it could not be told through a mist of fantasy, a "Field of Dreams." When an associate had suggested baseball as a future project, Mr. Burns thought that it might serve as a light respite from "The Civil War." "Now the young men would be out playing in the fields, not dying in the fields," the film maker said.</p><p>"Baseball" was planned for nine hours, but Mr. Burns said the series kept expanding as he discovered how fertile the history was. "I think Ken was feeling his oats about the success of 'The Civil War' and felt encouraged to make this one bigger," says Shelby Foote, the Civil War historian who emerged as the star talking head of "The Civil War" and who also appears in "Baseball." "But I don't think he believes baseball is more important than the Civil War."</p><p>Will 18 1/2 hours prove too much? "It's no longer than the average American League game," says Chris Berman, the sportscaster for ESPN. Jon Miller, his colleague, adds: "I'm certainly eager for it, but the first question is how well it hooks you the first night. I've seen some clips, and it's left me wanting much more."</p><p>PBS expects people to partake of "Baseball" in three ways: watching and taping the live broadcasts or purchasing the set of nine videocassettes. John Grant, a senior vice president at PBS, acknowledges that it won't get the ratings "The Civil War" got, although in sheer numbers of viewers he expects "Baseball" to exceed the cumulative 39 million of "The Civil War."</p><p>"It's hard to sustain that kind of viewership," said Mr. Grant. "But we never told Ken to cut it down to 10, 12 or 14 hours. We never gasped at 18 1/2."</p>                </div>
