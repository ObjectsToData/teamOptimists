                    <p>COLUMBIA University is unusual because it has one woman on the faculty in its physics department. Most universities in the United States have none. Last spring Elena Aprile, an associate professor of physics at Columbia with a strong independent streak, was unanimously recommended for tenure. "I call it a miracle," she said. "I'm very proud."</p><p>But for now, at least, the miracle is on hold.</p><p>Dr. Aprile said a recent change in administration has caused her bid for tenure to be delayed. "I am not satisfied with how things are going. When I talked to a colleague about it he asked: 'Why do you need an increase? You have a husband. Why do you have to rush?' It makes you think that the delay is connected to gender. Officially they say that's nonsense, but I can't help but wonder, if I were a man would it have happened faster?"</p><p>Eduardo Macagno, dean of Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, denied that any sex discrimination was involved and said the tenure decision was simply being held for further review.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Aprile, though not happy about the delay, said she was confident she would eventually be approved. But whatever the outcome, problems persist for women trying to break into science faculties -- particularly physics -- on campuses across the country.</p><p>Women are more commonly represented in the humanities than the sciences, though even in humanities they do not match their male colleagues in number. In 1989, women accounted for about 30 percent of academics employed in humanities departments. But they represented only 18 percent of those in the science and engineering departments.</p><p>Regardless of academic field, women are less likely to receive tenure than their male counterparts, and on average are paid less. Betty Vetter, the executive director of the Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology, says it takes women two to three years longer than men to receive tenure once they become eligible, and two to six years longer than men to become eligible.</p><p>In physics the discrepancies are even greater. Both male and female physicists describe hostile, demoralizing environments of male camaraderie and female isolation. "Departmental faculty are largely male and are more likely to give him tenure and decide that she hasn't quite proved herself yet," Dr. Vetter says.</p><p>The American Association of University Professors says women comprised 30 percent of faculties in 1992, but only 3 percent of physics faculties. Of 20 developed nations studied by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, America tied with South Korea for the least women on physics faculties. In France and Italy women accounted for 23 percent; in Hungary nearly half the physics faculty were women. American Institute of Physics data showed more than half of American physics faculties had no women.</p><p>The National Research Council has found that American women physicists consistently earn less than male counterparts and that the disparity increases as experience increases. In 1992 a woman in physics earned 85 percent of a man's starting salary, one of the largest gaps in the sciences.</p><p>Explanations for the paucity of women on American physics faculties range from the physiological to the sociological. But the physiological factors are a matter of continuous dispute. Some scientists studying hormonal influences on brain function conclude that men as a group have innate neurological patterns of ability that tend to make them more capable in physics than women. But others say these studies fail to prove significant brain differences or, if minor differences do exist, that they result in different aptitudes.  No Encouragement</p><p>Female students have tended to score lower than males on standardized math aptitude tests. Still, one Federal Department of Education study shows that when math scores were the same, nearly twice as many males pursued physics as females. Female students with a physics aptitude are often not encouraged or recruited. Sheila Tobias, a political science lecturer, says women often do not possess the characteristics males feel are essential -- that is, a certain manner and sense of being consumed by science to the exclusion of all else.  Women are often seen as outsiders, Ms. Tobias said, and "Scientists are deeply prejudiced against non-in-group types. So the problem isn't women as women but women as a subset of the out-group."</p><p>Difficulty in getting tenure may itself discourage women from entering the field. "Tenure is quite a subjective thing," said Dr. Kay Kinoshita, who left Harvard last year for a tenured position at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. "There is plenty of room for discrimination because it's based on pseudo-objective criteria, like the quality of the person's research -- not just the research, but its quality." And since the advancement process can be nebulous, discrimination suits are rarely successful. When women complain about sex bias, Dr. Kinoshita said, "They are perceived to be blaming some other inadequacy on that."</p><p>But as more women do manage to enter academic physics, some universities are noticing sex-bias concerns and are trying to address them. Dr. Stewart Smith, chairman of the physics department at Princeton University, said, "We know that the male students and faculty have not been supportive of women students and we are trying to raise the consciousness of our faculty."</p><p>To alleviate anxiety, Dr. Smith said, physics professors are trying to keep courses as informal and interactive as possible. "I've seen evidence of this many times in classes," he said, "when, even if the man has the wrong answer he will just open his mouth and say it, whereas the woman will be more concerned and careful before participating even when she has the right answer."</p><p>Conversely, Dr. Smith said, it is hard for older male professors to advise young women about what they can expect and how to adjust, since he and many other senior staff members were students at a time when family roles and structures were dramatically different. "It makes it very difficult for older males to relate to the situations young women face.  And they probably don't identify with us very well either." Setting a Precedent</p><p>Dr. Aprile says one of her goals is to help establish a precedent for young girls like her daughter, Susanna, who is 9 years old. Four years ago, when she was pregnant with her second daughter, Giulia, she not only continued to teach throughout the pregnancy but, one month after the baby was born, she submitted a research proposal to develop a gamma-ray telescope for NASA. She said the experience was grueling, but she took pride in achieving what no male colleague could:</p><p>"I can put together a big proposal, which was accepted, and I can have a baby. They should be jealous."</p><p>Photo: "I call it a miracle," said Dr. Elena Aprile of Columbia University, on her being recommedned for tenure -- but the miracle is on hold. (C.M.
