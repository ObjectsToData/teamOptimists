At his head stands a tall arched spigot that, with tap handles mimicking wings, easily suggests a swan in mourning. His head is squarish and overlarge. (This, when he was a toddler, made him seem top-heavy and unsteady on his feet.) His widow's peak is common among the men in my family, though this one is more dramatic than most. An inverted pyramid, it begins high above the temples and falls steeply to an apex in the boxy forehead, over the heart-shaped face. A triangle into a box over a heart. His eyes (now closed) were big and dark and glittery; they drew you into his sadness when he cried.   A horrendous wound runs the length of the abdomen, from the sternum all the way to the pubic mound. The wound resembles a mouth whose lips are pouting and bloody. Massive clamps are gouged into these lips at regular intervals along the abdomen.">

                    <p>My brother's body lies dead and naked on a stainless-steel slab. At his head stands a tall arched spigot that, with tap handles mimicking wings, easily suggests a swan in mourning. His head is squarish and overlarge. (This, when he was a toddler, made him seem top-heavy and unsteady on his feet.) His widow's peak is common among the men in my family, though this one is more dramatic than most. An inverted pyramid, it begins high above the temples and falls steeply to an apex in the boxy forehead, over the heart-shaped face. A triangle into a box over a heart. His eyes (now closed) were big and dark and glittery; they drew you into his sadness when he cried.</p><p>A horrendous wound runs the length of the abdomen, from the sternum all the way to the pubic mound. The wound resembles a mouth whose lips are pouting and bloody. Massive clamps are gouged into these lips at regular intervals along the abdomen.</p><p>This is a surgeon's incision. The surgeon was presented with a patient shot six times with a large-caliber handgun. Sensing the carnage that lay within, he achieved the largest possible opening and worked frantically to save my brother's life. He tied off shattered vessels, resectioned the small intestine, repaired a bullet track on the liver, then backed out.</p><p>The closing would have required two pairs of hands. An assistant would have gripped the two sides of the wound and drawn them together while a second person cut in the clamps. The pulling together has made my brother's skin into a corset that crushes in on the abdomen from all sides. The pelvic bones jut up through the skin. The back is abnormally arched from the tension. The wound strains at the clamps, threatening to rip itself open. The surgeon worked all night and emerged from surgery gaunt, his greens darkened with sweat. "I tied off everything I could," he said, and then he wept at the savagery and the waste.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This is the body of Blake Melvin Staples, the seventh of my family's nine children, the third of my four brothers, born 10 years after me. I know his contours well. I bathed and diapered him when he was a baby.</p><p>The medical examiner photographed the body on Feb. 13, 1984, at 9:45 A.M. The camera's flash is visible everywhere -- on the pale-green tiles of the surrounding walls, on the gleaming neck of the spigot, on the stainless steel of the slab, on the bloody lips of the wound.</p><p>The coroner's report begins with a terse narrative summary: "The deceased, 22-year-old Negro male, was allegedly shot by another person on the premises of a night club as a result of a 'long standing quarrel.' He sustained multiple gunshot wounds of the abdomen and legs and expired during surgery."</p><p>Blake was a drug dealer; he was known for carrying guns and for using them. His killer, Mark McGeorge, was a former customer and cocaine addict. At the trial, Mark's lawyer described the shooting as a gunfight in which Blake was beaten to the draw. This was doubtful. Blake was shot six times, three times in the back. No weapon was found on or near his body. Blake is said to have cried out for his life as he lay on the ground. "Please don't shoot me no more. I don't want to die." His voice had a touch of that dullness one hears from the deaf, a result of ear infections he suffered as a child. He would tilt his head woefully from side to side trying to pour out the pain. His vowels were locked high in his throat, behind his nose. This voice kept him a baby to me. This is the voice in which he would have pleaded for his life.</p><p>AT 13, I WAS OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT MOMENTS I'D LIVED WERE slipping away and becoming lost to me one by one. I would seize onto something I'd just seen or thought and ask myself if I'd remember that thing five minutes, five hours or five days from now. The answer was always no.</p><p>This vigilance came on in seizures that could strike me anywhere -- while I lay in the grass making out figures in the clouds, as I pushed a shopping cart down the supermarket aisles and especially while I stood at the crosswalk waiting for the light to change. I clung to every detail of the hot rod that had just roared by: the glint of the sun flowing over its body, the thunder of the engine, the twin puffs of smoke from its dual exhausts. I included the backdrop, too: the steepled church across the street, the sign out front that described the sermon and gave the minister's name, the wrought-iron fence around them. This took concentration; it excluded everything except drawing breath. The sign changed from "Don't Walk" to "Walk" to "Don't Walk" again. Someone called out, "Hey, you wake up!" and I did. To them, I was a silly boy asleep at the crosswalk. For me, this was serious business. I had saved a part of my life that would otherwise have been lost.</p><p>I suspected mental illness. My eighth-grade teacher relieved me of this burden with a movie about the physics of time. The movie was a cartoon. It began with a rocket sitting on the launch pad, ready for takeoff. At the launch site were a perky set of twins, Bill and Bob, accompanied by cheerleaders and a roaring crowd. The twins were fresh from high school, sporting identical pompadours and identical varsity sweaters. Bill climbed into the rocket and blasted off into space at the speed of light. Bob stayed behind with the crowd and waved. What the narrator said next made me sit up and take notice. He said that time passed more slowly for the traveling twin than for the one who stayed at home. Light speed slowed the clock and the beating of the heart. Bill returned from space as perky and erect as the day he left. His brother, Bob, was old and withered and confined to a wheelchair.</p>                </div>
