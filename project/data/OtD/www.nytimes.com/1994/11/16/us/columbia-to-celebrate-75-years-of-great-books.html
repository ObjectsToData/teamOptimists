                    <p>In a Columbia College classroom the other day, Prof. Hamid Dabashi, 43, was discussing Machiavelli's "The Prince." He pointed to a passage about the dangers of political alliances in uncertain times.</p><p>The professor paused. "Mayor Giuliani didn't take CC -- or at least he never read Machiavelli," he said, to laughter from his students.</p><p>CC, after all, stands for Contemporary Civilization, and even as it enters its 75th year, the course, one of the first to be required for all the college's undergraduates, was proving relevant. Under siege for what critics call a tradition-bound approach to Western civilization, the course, its admirers say, gives students an unequaled foundation for understanding modern times. The discussion in Professor Dabashi's classroom is what the core curriculum's founding fathers envisioned.</p><p>Tomorrow night, the college's Alumni Association is holding a black-tie dinner to celebrate what was essentially just a brash idea back in 1919 -- requiring all students to take a course or two designed to help them soak up the absolute best of their civilization. Today, the staples of the reading list are much the same as 50 years ago -- Aristotle and Augustine, Plato and Diogenes, Descartes and Locke, Shakespeare and Milton, Jefferson and de Tocqueville, Darwin and Nietzsche.</p>                </div>

                    <p>It is this adherence to traditional classics that has become a flash point in today's debate on many campuses over multiculturalism -- a debate that some fear imperils Columbia's core curriculum. Jacques Barzun, the eminent philosopher and historian who spent 50 years teaching Contemporary Civilization, said the core was being threatened from both without and within -- by those who argue that the program does not do enough to celebrate non-Western cultures, and by an academic reward system that steers rising young professors away from broad-based general courses.</p><p>CC, as generations of Columbians have called it, was conceived shortly after the United States entered World War I when officials in Washington -- apprehensive about the ignorance of many Americans about the civilization they were defending -- asked Columbia to develop a course called War Issues that could be adapted for students -- and future servicemen -- at colleges and universities throughout the country. Later, the name became Peace Issues.</p><p>In 1919, Columbia refined it, renamed it again and required it for graduation. The purpose of Contemporary Civilization, according to the College Announcement of 1919, was to prepare each student for "an intelligent participation in the civilization of his own day."</p><p>There were no lectures. Classes were limited to 24 students, who would meet four times a week with professors in diverse specialties.</p><p>In the early days, students did not read Homer, Dante and Goethe; professors used their own work. In the 1930's, when a second course, called Humanities: Masterpieces of European Literature and Philosophy -- Lit Hum for short -- was added to the so-called core curriculum, the great books were added to both classes.</p><p>The two courses flourished thanks largely to the enthusiasm of some very bright and ambitious young professors -- Mark Van Doren, the poet and professor of English, the psychologist Mortimer Adler, who went on to become director of editorial planning for the Encyclopedia Britannica, and the economist Rexford G. Tugwell, who later became a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain trust."</p><p>Professor Barzun, who began teaching CC directly after his graduation from Columbia in 1927, is to accept the alumni's Alexander Hamilton Medal at the dinner tonight, but, he insists, only on behalf of 75 fellow members of the Columbia faculty who have taught the course and as a gesture to honor the idea itself. He recalled impassioned discussions about the concept over lunch every Thursday at the Faculty Club and how the idea spread throughout academe, taking root in institutions from the University of Chicago to St. John's College at Annapolis, Md.</p><p>It came just as a reaction was setting in against a trend in some places, fostered at Harvard by Charles William Eliot's "free elective system," to offer students almost complete freedom in choosing courses.</p><p>CC was considered necessary because of the postwar shift from elite student populations to more diverse groups. There was also a sense that for better or worse, Wilsonian America had joined the international community and that American soldiers returning from overseas were eager to know more about foreign cultures.</p><p>Over the years, the core was sniped at for being superficial on the one hand and for force-feeding students material for which they were ill-prepared on the other.</p><p>A story about Raymond Weaver, a longtime Columbia professor, illustrates both the zeal and occasional smugness of those who taught CC.</p><p>At a dinner party in 1936, Professor Weaver happened to be seated next to a fashionable young woman who asked: "Have you read 'Gone With the Wind'?"</p><p>"No," Professor Weaver replied.</p><p>"Well, you ought to," the woman said. "It's been out six months."</p><p>"Have you read the Divine Comedy?" retorted the professor.</p><p>"No," said the young woman.</p><p>"Well, you ought to," Professor Weaver shot back. "It's been out 600 years."</p><p>But chortling over professorial evangelism was nothing compared with the bitter assault on the core curriculum in the 1960's, when it was pronounced, and denounced, "Eurocentric," "hegemonic" and insulting to many Americans who represented the racial and ethnic diversity of the United States. In this atmosphere, many colleges and universities profoundly reshaped their course offerings and retained classes like CC only as electives.</p><p>Columbia's president, George Rupp, told a story last week about CC's relevance today.</p><p>"Last year, I heard about a young boy denouncing the Somalis after having seen on TV the body of an American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu," he said. "His father, a Columbia graduate, had taken the CC course and recalled that in 'The Iliad,' Achilles dragged the body of Hector through the streets. He was able to explain to his son that such horrors have always taken place in war, and that the Somalis should not be demonized because of it."</p><p>Professor Barzun said updating it was perfectly acceptable "if trade-offs are made in the same category."</p><p>"If you drop from the core a passage by John Calvin and substitute something by Martin Luther King, there's nothing wrong with that," he continued, "but to take away a masterpiece like Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' and substitute an only pretty-fair novel published last year is not a trade-off but a diminution of the idea."</p><p>"There are some who argue that Columbia's core curriculum is a self-enclosed thing which excludes the study of non-Western civilizations," he said. "That's not so. From Western civilization, one learns a great deal about other societies which have interacted with it for centuries."</p><p>Asked how the core curriculum could survive in an academic system that rewards specialization, Professor Barzun drew a deep breath and said wearily, "I don't think there's an institutional solution."</p><p>Then, after a pause, he added: "But in every generation there are a certain number of men and women who perceive the value of general education. They enlist younger people who in turn will enlist still others in the same way that it happened back in the 1920's when we had those animated discussions in the Faculty Club."</p><p>Photo: Prof. Hamid Dabashi presiding over a recent discussion in Columbia College's Contemporary Civilization course.
