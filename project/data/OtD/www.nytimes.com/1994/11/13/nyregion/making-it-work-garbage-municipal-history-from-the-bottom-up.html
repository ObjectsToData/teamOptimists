"The idea of the history of garbage is fun," she said. "Everybody's more or less aware of it, and everybody's more or less irritated about it."</p>                </div>

                    <p>And, as the show demonstrates, they have been for a long, long time. Garbage, it turns out, is one of the pivots on which New York City history and politics turn. Now, it's quality-of-life issues, environmental-impact statements, pesky recycling violations and fights over the Brooklyn Navy Yard incinerator and sludge plants. Then, it was patronage, public health and geography (the island of Manhattan is about 20 percent landfill, of which half is garbage).</p><p>"Garbage!" is divided logically, with time periods and themes overlapping, into four basic segments. For the first, 1840-1920, the walls teem with giant hogs, rats and insects, display cases hold disease maps made by sanitation reformers, and a small tenement is evoked, complete with a soundtrack of children's voices and a linen-hung clothesline. The first of eight "smell boxes" is here, too: a whiff of baking bread. An outhouse stands in a corner, a reminder of the slow arrival of the modern bathroom.</p><p>The other segments (street cleaning and garbage collection, 1860-1994; garbage disposal, 1860-1994; contemporary issues: pollution, technology and social commentary, 1960's-90's) are also carefully drawn, including sanitation uniforms, brushes from a street sweeper, time lines, even a magnified version of a Dump It board game.</p><p>Dr. Fee remembers the gestation of "Garbage!" A professor at the New School for Social Research wanted to have a garbage symposium and proposed an accompanying exhibition. "I don't think the symposium ever came off," she said, but the show won financing from V. Ponte &amp; Sons, a 75-year-old carting company; the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Pinewood Foundation. Still, it was necessary to deal with some unusual problems. For instance, what to call it.</p><p>"Sanitation" was considered, but that was too antiseptic. "We tried some dry academic titles," said Dr. Steven H. Corey, the show's other curator. "And we thought of 'King Garbage,' " he said, referring to the icon that appeared often in turn-of-the-century political cartoons. But to his surprise, he said, "P.R. said, 'Garbage is great.' "</p><p>Then there was what to leave out. Sewage, for instance, had been done, they decided. And organized crime? In some ways, Dr. Corey said, talking about the Mafia could be construed as a slur. After all, he said, "Most of the Italians who were involved in garbage in the 19th century were ragpickers." And, until relatively recently, he noted, most sanitation workers were Italian-Americans.</p><p>Lou Storey, the library's exhibition designer, faced a variety of challenges. One was making appropriate backdrops for the gritty artifacts. "I don't want them to be too artsy," he said. "In every way you can think of, I wanted this show to have a lot of textures." So set-building materials were procured from CBS's soap opera division, including fake tin ceilings and brick and cement block walls. Water-based paint was thrown onto wood paneling; workers carefully made badly plastered walls. The results pleased him. They also prompted inquiries about his availability for interior design from impressionable homeowners.</p><p>And recently, Mr. Storey decided that the oil-spill display was too "polite." So the photographs were enlarged and color photocopied to turn them grainy and were tacked up so their corners curl away from the wall. The word "pollution" was screened across the images in a sickly green.</p><p>"I hate that," observed Jennifer Rotanz, the assistant manager of public relations, accompanying a visitor on a private tour last week.</p><p>"Good, good," responded Mr. Storey.</p><p>Nelson Feliciano, who has worked in the library's maintenance department for 10 years, was doing a little solid-waste management of his own the other day, sweeping up bits of paper, dust, paper clips, a piece of plastic and a few nails and screws from the floor of the exhibit.</p><p>Did he like the show? He gazed at Ms. Ukeles's artwork. Just moments ago, she had described her intention that it be an arch that shamed no one.</p><p>"That's all the working-hard men, and women, too," Mr. Feliciano said. Would such people be surprised that they were the subject of a library exhibition? "You could kinda say that," he said, smiling and leaning back into his broom.</p><p>Photos: Thinking trash: Dr. Steven H. Corey atop 1,300 pounds of recyclable paper.
