Small wonder then that for the next 40 years Mr. Ellison found himself, in virtually every interview, fending off an inevitable question: When will the second novel be finished?   This was a question that Mr. Ellison, who died on Saturday at the age of 80, deflected with a laugh or, annoyed, refused to discuss. The real answer, in recent years, was soon, much sooner than anyone outside Mr. Ellison's close associates suspected.">

The real answer, in recent years, was soon, much sooner than anyone outside Mr. Ellison's close associates suspected.</p><p>Joe Fox, Mr. Ellison's editor at Random House, and close friends of the novelist say that Mr. Ellison has left a manuscript of somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 pages. At the time of his death, he had been working on it every day and was close to completing the work, whose fate now rests with his widow, Fanny. Communication With His Editor</p><p>"I knew he was working on it and he didn't want to talk about it or feel any sense of pressure," said Mr. Fox. "As late as March 7 he told me I would have it very soon. I got the impression that it was virtually finished. I didn't ask any questions, although I would have loved to."</p>                </div>

                    <p>When asked whether Random House planned to publish the novel, Mr. Fox said: "It's too soon to say. I don't even know the title. It's up to his wife." Mrs. Ellison has not been available for interviews.</p><p>Other than Mrs. Ellison, the person closest to the unfinished novel is John F. Callahan, a friend of Mr. Ellison's for the last 16 years and the dean of arts and humanities at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Ore.</p><p>"My own guess is that it's not just going to be a manuscript in a library," said Mr. Callahan. "There's something there." Ellison's 'Ulysses'?</p><p>For readers of "Invisible Man," that "something" is fraught with promise. It holds forth the possibility that a work of fiction to equal, and perhaps surpass, "Invisible Man" looms on the horizon.</p><p>"From what I've, read, if 'Invisible Man' is akin to Joyce's 'Portrait of the Artist,' then the novel in progress may be his 'Ulysses,' " said Mr. Callahan. "It's a weaving together of all kinds of voices, and not simply voices in the black tradition, but white voices, too: all kinds of American voices."</p><p>If Mr. Ellison, as his final creative act, were to top "Invisible Man," it would be a stunning bequest. "Invisible Man," acclaimed as an American classic from the moment it appeared, has never been out of print. It has sold millions of copies worldwide. On college campuses it is required reading in 20th-century American literature courses, and it has been the subject of hundreds of scholarly articles.</p><p>The novel has decisively influenced many writers, among them Toni Morrison, Ernest J. Gaines, James Alan McPherson and Leon Forrest.</p><p>"Few writers in any tradition create a metaphor that accounts for the political condition of a group of people as well as the human condition," said Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard University, speaking of Mr. Ellison's use of invisibility in the first novel. "And he created this truly universal novel by delving deeply, deeper than anybody before him, into the fullest range of African-American culture: music, art, folklore, storytelling traditions, signifying humor. It's an encyclopedia of black culture."</p><p>The success of the novel imposed a burden on Mr. Ellison. It set an almost impossible artistic standard to live up to. Perhaps more troublesome, Mr. Ellison's slow, exacting approach to his craft, his infinite patience, ran counter to the public impatience for a repeat performance. If the questions about the second novel were merely annoying in the years immediately after the publication of "Invisible Man," they became painful after 1966, when more than 350 pages of the manuscript of Mr. Ellison's second novel burned in a fire at his summer home in Massachusetts. Two Essay Collections</p><p>The publication of two collections of his writings on fiction, jazz and politics, "Shadow and Act" (1964) and "Going to the Territory" (1986), seemed only to whet the public's appetite for the slowly gestating work in progress. From time to time, excerpts of the new novel appeared in literary quarterlies.</p><p>"He never complained about it, but my feeling was that it bothered him," Saul Bellow said, referring to the constant inquiries of reporters. "He didn't want to be identified forever with 'Invisible Man.' "</p><p>Mr. Bellow shared a house with Mr. Ellison and his wife in Dutchess County in the late 1950's when the two men taught at Bard College. Mr. Bellow had just completed "The Adventures of Augie March" and was at work on "Henderson the Rain King." Mr. Ellison was working on his second novel.</p><p>"He took a sort of jazz musician's attitude to writing," Mr. Bellow recalled. "He was always very happy when he was blowing a riff on the typewriter. And his feeling for the language was such that there was nothing paradoxical or kinky about the transfer from music to the page and back again."</p><p>Mr. Bellow read large sections of the work in progress and published part of it in his literary review, The Noble Savage.</p>                </div>
