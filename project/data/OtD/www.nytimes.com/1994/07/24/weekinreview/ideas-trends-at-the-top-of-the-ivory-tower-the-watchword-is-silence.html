They called for the reform of American education, proposed safeguards for democracy, sought to defuse the cold war, urged moral standards for scientific research and addressed other important issues of the time.</p><p>Today, almost no college or university president has spoken out significantly about Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea, health care, welfare reform, the attack on the National Endowment for the Arts or dozens of other issues high on the national agenda.</p><p>Many academic leaders are frank about their reticence. Jack Peltason, president of the University of California, said: "When I speak out in behalf of the university, I'm always trying to be careful." Then, he added with a professorial chuckle: "I don't have academic freedom."</p><p>Among the most recently appointed college and university chiefs, George E. Rupp, who became president of Columbia University last October, has become known among some faculty members on the Morningside Heights campus as The Invisible Man.</p>                </div>

                    <p>When interviewed, President Rupp reveals a penchant for euphemism. Asked about his plans to consolidate the Business School with the Economics Department, he replied: "Collaboration is the metaphor, not consolidation. Or, I would call it enhancement -- putting a positive spin on it. The metaphors need not be negative, like downsizing and consolidating."</p><p>Hugo F. Sonnenschein, who became president of the University of Chicago last October, is more famous on the south side of Chicago for having written a thank-you note to a 6-year-old girl who gave him a slightly squished M &amp; M than for any important policy statement.</p><p>An instructive example of the new breed is Gerhard Casper, the suave, German-born legal scholar who succeeded Donald Kennedy in 1992 as president of Stanford University. President Casper came into office after Dr. Kennedy -- often provocative and outspoken -- resigned in the wake of allegations that the university had misspent millions of dollars in Federal research grants.</p><p>The trustees made no secret of their wish that Dr. Kennedy's successor not only restore integrity to the university but keep himself out of the headlines. In his inaugural address, Dr. Casper broadly hinted that he had caught their drift. He declared that a university "must not have a dominant way of thinking," and quoted a First Amendment scholar who had suggested that a high university official could not take a position on a social issue without inhibiting the freedom of dissent.</p><p>It was not long, however, before Dr. Casper ignored his own advice. When asked by a reporter to confirm that he had written a letter supporting President Clinton's nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the Supreme Court, he thought it a fair question to be asked of a former professor of law, and so allowed that he indeed supported the choice.</p><p>"What came out in The New York Times the next day," he recalled with chagrin, "is that the presidents of both Columbia and Stanford supported Ginsburg. As a law professor, I felt I hadn't been completely castrated. But that's the problem. Even when I act personally, it gets taken as something else."</p><p>The result is that Dr. Casper became Mr. Cool. "I feel I must speak out on issues that concern the university," he said, "but I was not appointed to speak out on a whole range of social issues because when I do there will be those who disagree."</p><p>Yet he has proved extremely circumspect even when discussing university issues. For example, when a faculty groundswell indicated that Stanford might become one of the first major American universities to extend health insurance and other benefits to the homosexual partners of its faculty and staff, Dr. Casper declined to take a stand on the issue. He explained to a reporter: "If I took a position I would have possibly forced the trustees to choose between backing up their new president or rejecting their new president. I didn't want the trustees to be in that position."</p><p>Woodrow Wilson, who took on alumni, trustees and anyone else who stood in his way to fight the special privilege of the private dining clubs at Princeton University at the turn of the century, would have been appalled.  The same goes for Mr. Hutchins of the University of Chicago, who -- never one to be accused of thinking small -- published a preliminary draft for a world constitution in 1948, or Mr. Conant of Harvard, who lectured the nation on the uses and misuses of science.</p><p>The exceptions to presidential timorousness are not likely to encourage outspokeness. Many academic leaders recall with a wince the ordeal of Kingman Brewster Jr. when president of Yale. In 1970, Yale students went on strike to show support for eight members of the Black Panthers then on trial in New Haven for murder and kidnapping. Mr. Brewster, who insisted that the university shouldn't become embroiled, tried to calm tensions by saying that he too was "skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States."</p><p>His supporters called the comment a political masterstroke that helped to defuse a powderkeg, but his critics -- many of whom were disgruntled alumni whose children had not been admitted to Yale under Mr. Brewster's stringent entrance requirements -- set up a howl that nearly drove him from office.</p><p>More recently, Stanley N. Katz, the president of the American Council of Learned Societies, was dropped as the Clinton Administration's candidate for Archivist of the United States. The reason, Congressional insiders say, is that Senate Republicans and conservative Democrats threatened to fight the nomination in retaliation for Mr. Katz's having challenged the policies of Lynne Cheney when she headed the National Endowment for the Humanities under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. A few academic leaders have lately found the courage to denounce political correctness -- oppression from the left -- and while these remarks are frequently hard-hitting they do not require great daring to deliver, especially in a present-day campus setting.  Rhetorical Tiptoeing</p><p>There are a number of possible explanations for this rhetorical tiptoeing through the tulips. Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown University, who was one of the first academic leaders to speak out against political correctness, said that today he and his colleagues are so preoccupied with fund raising that they fear offending virtually any faction. "It's not natural for me, but I must speak with tact and diplomacy," he said. "I have come to agree with Lord Chesterfield that wisdom is like carrying a watch. Unless asked, you don't have to tell everybody what time it is."</p><p>Mr. Katz said that current academic leaders are silent largely because they are overwhelmed with administrative burdens since universities have exploded in size, complexity and cost. "These institutions require feeding 24 hours a day," he said. "It's the same in industry. Nobody even knows who the head of Chrysler is today. That's because the people who run these organizations are swamped with administrative work."</p><p>"There's another reason, too," Mr. Katz said. "Both institutions and individuals today are looking for the main chance. They want to be rich and they won't let anything distract them from that. It's too bad, but it's an attribute of American life today."</p><p>Photo: George E. Rupp, President of Columbia University, delivering his inauguration speech last October.
