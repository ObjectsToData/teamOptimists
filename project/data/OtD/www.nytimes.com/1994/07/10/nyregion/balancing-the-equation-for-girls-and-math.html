That same woman, however, would probably never confess that try as she might, she just couldn't read a book. If she did, it would be no cause for a joke.   That double standard -- that it is socially acceptable for a woman to be ignorant in math, but not in humanities -- persists today. In an effort to reverse that trend and to encourage girls to pursue the study of math and science, Marymount College is holding its second yearly summer science and math workshop for high school girls.">

The girls not only take courses and work in laboratories but also attend career panels featuring female scientists, mathematicians and professionals in other fields that call for science and math backgrounds.</p><p>"It's very psychologically important for women to get over that business of thinking that it is feminine not to have number sense," said Dr. Maryam Hastings, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the college and director of the program. "What we try to do is go into the high schools and present role models, and get the average student to think about this as a career." The 'Critical Filter'</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Hastings said that research had identified math skills as the "critical filter" for progressing into a higher-paying career and added that in a technological society people lacking in mathematical and scientific training are at a distinct disadvantage when they enter the job market.</p><p>Yet at about the age of 13, when girls are entering puberty, they begin to stop pursuing courses in math and sciences and a gap appears between the number of those classes taken by girls and boys, she said. If they have abilities in those areas, they begin to downplay them. At that age, too, they begin to differentiate between their parents. Boys and girls alike go to their fathers, not their mothers, for help in math.</p><p>Girls also score lower than boys on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests. According to nationwide figures for the last 10 years, girls' average math score on the S.A.T. is about 50 points below that of boys; the average verbal score is about 10 points below (girls lost their edge over boys in the verbal section in 1972).</p><p>Some argue that the lower S.A.T. math scores simply reflect an innate lack of female aptitude for math skills; others, however, believe that it reflects society's tendency to steer girls away from math in the first place.</p><p>"Girls tend not to take as many math classes as boys, so when it comes to S.A.T.'s, we're looking at a population with much less preparation," Dr. Hastings said. "They say that the S.A.T. is blind to courses, but I don't think that's true. I think that on average, the more math you have the better you are going to perform. That's why part of our effort is to keep the girls in the math and science classrooms."</p><p>The summer program at Marymount differs from other intensive math and science courses in that it is not specifically directed to academically gifted and talented girls but to motivated but average students who might not otherwise have considered these fields for careers. Hands-On Experiments</p><p>The girls in the workshop spend their mornings in the science laboratories, then have lunch, followed by either math or computer classes. They are also divided into pairs to work on hands-on experiments that combine creativity with basic math and science skills.</p><p>For instance, each pair builds a model bridge using only toothpicks and glue, an endeavor that fosters some giggles, but also teaches architecture and engineering. At the science fair that concludes the workshop, the bridges are tested for endurance to see which can withstand the most weight.</p><p>Each pair also has to make a car that moves using only rubber bands to propel the vehicle. Another experiment involves making hot air balloons from tissue paper. Both projects teach basic principles of physics.</p><p>Math skills are challenged by using tessellation -- repeating mosaic patterns to fill a surface using the correct number of repetitions, which requires a good understanding of basic math calculations while stressing the creative aspects of mathematics. Field Trips and Pizza</p><p>Dr. Hastings also arranges career panels for the afternoons and organizes field trips. The girls have visited the genetics laboratory at New York Medical College, where they met with a husband-and-wife team working to isolate the gene that causes breast cancer.</p><p>Their two weeks also include a trip to the Maritime Center in Norwalk a visit to the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, and a trip to the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan, where a math teacher will use art to show how patterns developed historically.</p><p>The program, which also includes the occasional movie and pizza party, is free to participants, with the exception of a $100 lab fee. The workshop is sponsored by the Coca-Cola Company, Texaco, the General Electric Foundation, the Pfizer Foundation, CIBA Corporation and the Marymount Institute for the Education of Women and Girls in cooperation with the Westchester School-Business Partnership.</p><p>Photos: Melissa Tirado, above, and Sauday Saleem, begin to make rubber-band-powered cars at a summer science-and-math workshop for high school girls.; Monique Leveille, above right, gets help from Joanne Quinn, a physics teacher; Gretchen Teifer, program's assistant director, gives Patricia Fotakos a hand.
