A safer school environment. More hands-on instruction. More relevance in lessons, and teachers who were not afraid to try new and different methods of instruction. They wanted their children to learn about cultural and racial diversity, not from books, but from traveling around Brooklyn and visiting its institutions, seeing firsthand the richness that is New York.</p><p>Finding that the city's existing middle schools, often large and impersonal, lacked some or all of these qualities, these parents embarked on a journey of a most extraordinary kind. They simply created their own public school from scratch.</p><p>The process took them through six years of fits, starts and deflating stops. The most formidable obstacles were resistance, even resentment, from the city's unforgiving and often unbending school bureaucracy, and especially from other middle schools in the area. There were also neighborhood worries about traffic and other congestion, and, in an era of fiscal distress, constant fears that the parents might not be able to finance their dream.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But in the words of one parent, Janet Brand, they "kept at it, kept at it, kept at it," and in the end, in a remarkable case of educational good timing, their persistence coalesced with a citywide movement toward smaller, innovative schools. Which is how, on Sept. 12, Sara Brown, Jonathan Huegel, Delroy Danvers, Tia Hampton and the 70 or so other sixth and seventh graders walked into the Brooklyn School for Global Studies, 10 classrooms in the basement of another middle school, the Nathan Hale Middle School in Cobble Hill.</p><p>"If we aren't advocates for our children, who will be?" explained Ms. Brand, who works in the Board of Education's technical support office and helped organize the school so her 8-year-old son, Jeremy Yuan, can enroll in three years. "As adults, many of our dreams are hammered into the dirt by the bureaucracy. But it's really important for adults to teach our children to pursue their dreams."</p><p>Or as Larry Abrams, the new school's director, put it: "This is a classic study of parental involvement.  These parents built a Taj Mahal of education."</p><p>Along the bumpy path to that Taj Mahal, the Brooklyn school represents the fruits of a growing wave of parental activism in New York and beyond demanding more and better choices in middle schools.</p><p>Until recently, the middle grades had been a pedagogical nether world that too often did too little to nurture or guide students at a turbulent and critical juncture in life. Not only, as research shows, did the stepchild status of the middle grades plant the first seeds of a continuing and troubling high school dropout problem, it drove away many middle-class parents who had been willing to try the public elementary schools.</p><p>But the middle schools have been receiving new attention in recent years, as the children of baby boomers moved into sixth, seventh and eighth grades and as the notion that smaller is better took hold. In New York, the small-schools movement got a big boost from the former Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, and that support has continued under Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines; already, more than 50 small, new schools -- mostly high schools, but also middle and primary schools -- have blossomed in neighborhoods across the city. And last month, the Annenberg Foundation announced a $50 million gift to New York City public schools, with a chunk for small, experimental schools.</p><p>At Janet Brand's dream school on Baltic Street last week, early reviews from any school's harshest critics -- the students -- came pouring in.</p><p>"Teachers make school interesting," said Ebonei McCoy, a 12-year-old seventh grader. "I feel safe here." 'Not in the Status Quo'</p><p>Heather Lewis remembers the beginning, six years ago. As their elementary-school children moved closer to the middle grades, she and other parents shared their concerns about District 15's five intermediate schools. They worried about the large enrollments, about impersonality, about the threat of violence.</p><p>"Parents were looking for a small school, and that was not in the status quo," said Ms. Lewis, a nurse who became an educator because of her zeal for public schools. "We were looking for a school that had more hands-on learning and was integrated. We were looking for a school where our children, their teachers and parents had more power over their learning."</p><p>Ms. Lewis had experience in creating schools from nothing; several years before, she had helped plan an alternative elementary school, and she wanted her children to continue their education in a nurturing environment. Now, she was among the first to step forward to organize a parents' committee to create a new middle school.</p><p>The school they envisioned would be smaller and safer and stuffed with all that makes a school a rich repository of knowledge. But almost immediately, the plan struck a sour chord in District 15, a multi ethnic swath of Brooklyn that runs from the working-class neighborhoods of Sunset Park and Red Hook to the more prosperous brownstone enclaves of Cobble Hill, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.</p>                </div>
