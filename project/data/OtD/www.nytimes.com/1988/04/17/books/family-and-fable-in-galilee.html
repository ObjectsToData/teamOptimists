                    <p>ARABESQUES  By Anton Shammas. Translated by Vivian Eden. 263 pp. New York: Harper &amp; Row. $16.95.</p><p>THIS book is a history of its author's youth, although its immediacy reaches farther back in time than the life it is rendering, and becomes the memoir of a family and a fabled region - Galilee. ''Arabesques'' is a search for origins, and there are secrets, but I shall keep those secrets and allow the text to reach them in its own way. The path of its plot, like the layers and loops named by its punning title, winds through a maze of characters, times, motives and meanings, as Anton Shammas hunts for Anton Shammas in one of the more confused and confusing regions of the world. Despite its autobiographical qualities, it calls itself a fiction, perhaps because it tumbles chronology about and suddenly shifts its point of view, adapting to its purposes methods of narration more frequently found in fiction; perhaps because it might have seemed presumptuous in one still so young, to compose a life; but I prefer to believe the real aim of this impressively beautiful piece of prose is the discovery and definition, even the creation, of a self, not merely an account of a self already made.</p><p>''Who am I?'' is a question that has many answers, depending on what self is sought. Is it the legal self who hopes for an inheritance? Is it the tribal self whose finger will follow every vein that carries the family colors? Is it the psychological self, hoping for a harmony among its conflicting skills and feelings? Is it the cultural self, the native of a language, the exiled self who simply needs a passport and a port of entry? Or is it the self who is searching for a fresh essence, the ambitious self, the self of a better future, who shall eventually be described by his accomplishments the way Sir Walter Scott is now said to be the author of ''Waverley''?</p><p>There are those, of course, for whom the question is never a question, who arrive in the world at a comfortable station and whose identity papers are made unnecessary by their wealth, their breeding, the games they play, their accents and their clothes; and there are those, at the other extreme, who are told they are untouchable, that they are slaves, Jews, below the salt and beyond the pale.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Similarly, there are things that fit so firmly in their genres that there can never be any doubt about what they are, such as Abyssinian cats and Hasselblads, such as ''War and Peace,'' a novel if there ever was one, a novel in the grand upper-class sense; or, turning to the great unwashed, there are thousands of the trashy kind, the cheap sort Joyce's Molly Bloom read, which are equally unmistakable, such as alley cats and box cameras. ''Arabesques,'' however, is in the same questionable condition as its author and narrator, an Arab from the Haifa region of Israel - a place which has lost its definition. Anton Shammas is a</p><p>Christian Arab who speaks and writes Hebrew and considers himself an Israeli. As if this weren't contradiction enough, he grew up in a modest village, rooted in the earth and in local customs, surrounded by fanaticism and superstition and familiar with the pleasures and pains of peasant life and peasant tastes - a situation he renders beautifully in the first part of this book. Yet he is now an accomplished student and speaker of English, a literary editor and television producer, someone who has sojourned in Paris and attended the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa in Iowa City; a writer, moreover, who sets down his Palestinian thoughts in lyrical Hebrew prose and employs with ease and skill the most sophisticated contemporary techniques. By working closely with his translator, Vivian Eden (even this name enters the symbolic swirl of the text), he has given us a work in eloquent English to ponder and enjoy. THE book is divided into ''Tale'' and ''Teller,'' two voices that are given alternate, if not equal, opportunities. The Tale concerns itself with origins, with ''who I was,'' and recreates the village life of the author's family, sorting out aunts, uncles, brothers and cousins like clothes to be washed, and evoking the odors of bread and earth, the colors of sky and walls. Like many conquered and crisscrossed countries, the Holy Land is an active producer of orphans and the hunt here for a heritage among doubles and substitutes rivals anything in Dickens, who also specialized in displaced persons. The Teller (who has several points of view but only one voice) returns to the Tale the way Mr. Shammas himself returns from Iowa and Paris to the splintered Palestine of his past. The Teller and the Tale are one, an epigraph from John Barth intimates, but the division of the narrative into the Teller's now, and the Tale's then suggests a sundering which the search is attempting to heal. How is the ''what I am'' to be reconciled with ''what I was''?</p><p>In one sense, this is accomplished by shaking the family tree until the fruit falls; but in another, profounder sense, it is reached simply by rendering, recreating, celebrating ''what is'' and ''what was'' together, like camel and car on the same road. We might call it being faithful to the phenomenological facts. Readers will be reminded of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magical Macondo more than once, not only because, for us, this novel's local color is equally exotic, but because the mythological, the primitive, the superstitious are weighed in the same tray with the scientifically real. The commonplace life of the village of Fassuta is suffused with the supernatural. Here, the uncommon is common, too. Divine coincidence is one strand of the fabric of existence. People foresee the future as often as they misplace the past. Anton Shammas does not allow the magical to move beyond metaphor into myth, however, the way Mr. Garcia Marquez does. He is a reconciler, not an exploiter. He does not, that is to say, ''poetize'' these peasant peculiarities for the pleasure of big city tourists. One scene can stand for many that function in a similar way. A 9-year-old girl (whose lineage is immediately and painstakingly traced, just as everyone else's is, as if it scissored their silhouettes) has the ability to read the mandal, a saucer of water on the surface of which a slick of olive oil is spread; in its slightly iridescent clouds certain gifted eyes can see things frequently far away in place and time. At the behest of her brother, a delegation from a local monastery observes the girl and writes an account of her powers, among them an ability to describe entire shelves of books in the monastery library. (This report, itself, eats its way through the text like a worm at home.) She does not tell the delegation all she sees, however. Some things she can scarcely tell herself; she hides them away, like every future, in the past, and refuses to think of them again till they arrive like a fist on the door or a shot in the street: ''She didn't dare allow them across the threshold of her lips or even the threshold of her heart. . . . Until she was about seventeen, she did not even allow herself to think about them. And when she finally did, she could not grasp their meaning. She would see images alternately rising and sinking into the oil slick that writhed and flickered on the surface of the saucer. She once saw a child dying. The child is her own son and also the son of another woman who is her kin, who comes to find out whether all is well with him. He changes shape and grows within her, a dead child grows within her, a corpse twines inside and passions try to root it out until they concede, placated.''</p>                </div>
