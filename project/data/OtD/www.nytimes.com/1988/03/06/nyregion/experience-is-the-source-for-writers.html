                    <p>A PRESTON woman described the difficult birth of her son in a car, when the baby was deprived of oxygen for several minutes. A man from Old Lyme wrote of his boyhood summers by the shore, when his family slept in a large tent and ''had a porcelain flush toilet in its own little tent.''</p><p>Those are among the descriptions of experiences both harrowing and joyous in a series of life-writing workshops at libraries in southeastern Connecticut. In the workshops, writing teachers of writing help the participants write about themselves, journals, essays and short stories about broken marriages and serious illnesses, funny pets and lively children, horsedrawn carriages and beef-and-kidney pies that have figured in their lives.</p><p>The Southeastern Connecticut Library Association sponsors the series. Geared to a dozen or so participants each, they have proved so popular that the association has turned people away.</p><p>''It's part of the human condition to want to tell your story,'' the program coordinator of the association in Groton, Ginnie Gonci, said. ''Every program has been oversubscribed.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The workshops are part of a year-long program on biography, ''The Examined Life: Intimate Histories of 20th-Century Americans.'' The State Humanities Council finances the series.</p><p>The program includes nearly 40 free discussions on biographies and autobiographies led by scholars at 11 libraries.</p><p>''Since people will be reading biographies, we thought maybe they would like to write their own,'' said Ms. Gonci.</p><p>Published writers are scheduled to to describe how they had used material from their lives. Last fall, the director of the Writing Center at Connecticut College in New London, Theresa Ammirati, conducted the first series of life-writing workshops at the Waterford Public Library.</p><p>''I think very interesting writing came from it,'' she said. ''I saw some real talent.''</p><p>Mrs. Ammirati is now leading workshops at the Groton Public Library.</p><p>The head of the English department at the United States Coast Guard Academy, Jordon Pecile, is leading workshops at the Otis Library in Norwich, the Phoebe Griffin Noyes Library in Old Lyme and the Mystic-Noank Library.</p><p>Each series has five or six sessions and is scheduled for evenings or mornings. Applicants are asked to describe projects in autobiograhpical writing they were working on or would like to explore and to explain the their personal or artistic importance.</p><p>As the Norwich series began, Mr. Pecile spoke to 11 women and a man on couches or the floor in the library basement.</p><p>''This is a writing workshop,'' he said. ''We're going to write and we're going to talk about writing, and that's all we're going to do.''</p><p>He added that self-expression, not publication, would be the main goal of most participants. He also noted that it was important for the participants to get to know one another and invited them all to describe just what life experiences they wanted to put on paper.</p><p>One woman spoke of a divorce, after 27 years of marriage, and of the health problems of a daughter.</p><p>''I think if I could write about these things, I'd know where I am,'' she said, '</p><p>Another woman spoke of wanting to share with her six children a world they would never know, a Norwegian neighborhood, now gone, where she grew up.</p><p>Another woman chuckled as she told how she wanted to write about her pets. ''It's a form of autobiography, really,'' she said.</p><p>The woman whose son entered the world with such difficulty said people often asked her about what happened. The man discussed his growing up with ''a hard-living, hard-drinking father.''</p><p>Mr. Pecile offered suggestions about the material. To the woman who gave birth in a car, he suggested changing her first-person account into a short story. To another woman, he said, ''I think you want to write a personal essay about something you have on your mind.''</p><p>''We all have a lot of unfinished stories,'' he said.</p><p>Mr. Pecile noted later that interesting accounts were emerging from the Old Lyme workshops. Many participants in that morning series, he said were retired, and they had many years of memories. One man described spending wonderful boyhood summers in the tent. A woman described moving to New London as a child and how she and her family traveled from the train station to their new home in a horsedrawn carriage and found dinner, beef-and-kidney pie, prepared by a servant who had moved with them.</p><p>Mrs. Ammirati also noted the rich variety of material. One man, she said, described his experiences as a prisoner of war.</p><p>Another wrote of growing up and going through school with undiagnosed dyslexia. He wrote, she added, to make people more aware of such disabilities.</p><p>Mrs. Ammirati and Mr. Pecile urge the participants to write regularly and to bring their work to class for discussion.</p><p>''I think people are coming to learn about writing effectvely and to be in a situation that encourages writing and gives them some feedback,'' said Mrs. Ammirati. She added that libraries were excellent settings, because workshop participants found them accessible and comfortable.</p><p>Ms. Gonci said the associa tion was planning a program on world literature next year and hoped to include writing sessions.</p><p>''This is the first time the Humanities Council has funded a writing program,'' she said. ''We're sort of an experiment, and I think it's turning out well.''</p>                </div>
