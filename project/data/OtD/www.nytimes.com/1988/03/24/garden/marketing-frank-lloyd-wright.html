                    <p>Frank Lloyd Wright, a legend during most of his long life, has emerged as a growth industry in the last five years. A commercial, artistic and academic habitat of conferences, exhibitions, books and objects has recently grown up around the architect - a habitat that is expanding rapidly in unusual ways.</p><p>Today, the National Center for the Study of Frank Lloyd Wright opens at the corporate headquarters of Domino's Pizza in Ann Arbor, Mich., with a three-day symposium on the architect, who espoused an architecture organically related to the landscape.</p><p>That the museum, which owns about 300 pieces of decorative art by Wright, is housed in a pizza-chain headquarters dramatically marks the architect's passage from the domain of high art into mass culture, from the hands of taste makers and professional curators to people who simply love Wright's work, happen to own some and want to show it.</p><p>''I'd like to expose as many people as possible to Wright,'' said Thomas Monaghan, the president and founder of Domino's Pizza, who in less than four years has amassed the largest collection of Wright furniture and artifacts outside the Taliesin Fellowship, the architect's foundation in Arizona and Wisconsin. But do art and pizza mix?  Wright himself, who affected a porkpie hat and a cape, designed himself and his life to be a lightning rod of attention. A variety of forces have conspired over the last decade, however, to carry him and his work into realms he could hardly have anticipated.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The explosion of interest in design over the last decade, the popularity of historic preservation, the Reagan-era emphasis on Americana, the astronomical prices paid at auction for 20th-century furniture and the renewed interest in decoration in architecture have all spurred interest in Wright's legacy. Furniture, fabrics, stained-glass windows and decorative sculpture were all an integral part of his architecture.</p><p>Two recent events account in a direct way for the surge of interest in Wright. Since the death in 1985 of the architect's widow, Olgivanna, who tightly controlled access to his drawings and archives, there has been a greater openness on the part of the Taliesin Fellowship. And it has normalized relations with other institutions.</p><p>For example, the foundation has permitted the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif., to duplicate for its library almost all the 22,000 drawings in the Taliesin archives; and it has released 100 original drawings for sale at the Max Protetch Gallery in New York.</p><p>''The drawings now available at the Getty are a revelation, like treasures just discovered in a tomb,'' said Kathryn Smith, a Wright scholar in Los Angeles. The drawings have become the basis for a 12-volume collection published by A.D.A. Edita, a Japanese publishing house.</p><p>The second event is a recent legal settlement that has been perceived as opening up the reproduction of Wright's designs. The Taliesin Fellowship, which has licensed certain companies to produce many Wright plates, carpets and furniture, cannot prevent other companies from making Wright-inspired products, as long as they don't violate copyrights.</p><p>The popular interest in Wright, the demand for objects designed by him, and the possibility that they can now be reproduced and sold has meant that Wright's work is of increasing cultural and commercial interest.</p><p>On the one hand, more than 70 books on the architect are now in print; a new traveling show recently opened in Dallas, and the Frank Lloyd Wright house and studio in Oak Park, Ill., were restored last year. On the other hand, there are T-shirts, brooches, earrings, scarves, baseball hats and needlepoint kits imprinted with Frank Lloyd Wright patterns.</p><p>To raise money for the restoration of a Wright house in Los Angeles, the University of Southern California is selling, for $300 apiece, concrete blocks newly cast from the original forms Wright used in making the house.</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious intersection of high and popular culture is in the entry wing of Domino's headquarters, where signs indicate that the Wright museum is upstairs, next to the company's pizza archives and the Detroit Tigers archives (Mr. Monaghan owns the team). A collection of classic cars is to the left.</p><p>Mr. Monaghan plans to develop the surrounding acreage into a kind of theme park, with a grouping of expensive homes, a 35-story conference tower, a golf course and, eventually, a freestanding Wright museum. The headquarters, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, a Michigan architect, is a Wright-inspired design with roofs reminiscent of the Oak Park period; more than a quarter mile of the half-mile-long building is finished.</p><p>Mr. Monaghan dates his interest in Wright to his disovery as a 12-year-old of a book on the architect. Now a boyish-looking 50, he has pursued Wright since, from trailer trips through the Midwest in search of Wright houses to New York auctions.</p><p>''It's a personal collection,'' he said recently, sitting in his Wright-inspired office, sharing slices of his favorite combination pizza - pepperoni, sausage, bacon and onion -while deftly managing the strings of cheese. ''But I want to collect all the important periods and buildings, and cover the whole range of Wright's work.''</p><p>David Hanks, a scholar whose 1977 Smithsonian show focused attention on Wright's decorative arts, has advised Mr. Monaghan on the collection.</p><p>Last September, Mr. Monaghan spent a record $1.6 million for the solid-oak Husser House dining table of 1899, with its high-back chairs -roughly the cost of 160,000 16-inch cheese-and-mushroom pizzas.</p><p>The bidding wars at auction for Wright pieces, however, has caused concern among many preservationists: Wright buildings that have survived the threat of demolition through rising land values now are threatened from within. Lead-glass windows, for example, often command more on the architectural antiques market than an entire house. Yet the windows do not keep their meaning outside the spaces for which they were designed as organic parts, even though they can stand on their own.</p><p>''Prices were going up before I started buying,'' Mr. Monaghan said. He noted that many windows in his collection come from demolished houses: a suite of 34 lead-glass windows from the Avery Coonley Playhouse of 1912 in Riverside, Ill., has been in storage 30 years. His study center is also giving annual matching grants to restore Wright houses.</p><p>As books, conferences, exhibitions, articles and objects on Wright proliferate, they have come to affect each other directly and indirectly, as in an ecological system. Shows of his furniture have inspired auctions, which have brought both attention and threat to Wright houses, which has encouraged homeowners to organize meetings on preservation. All of this, in turn, has fed interest in the sale of artifacts.</p><p>During his life, Wright believed that there was no limit to the attention his genius deserved, but he might not be amused by Wright T-shirts, earrings and baseball hats. Often he railed against what he called ''mobocracy'' and the leveling effect of mass taste.</p><p>But at Domino's Farms, despite the Detroit Tigers and the pizza archives next door, and the Wright items in the gift shop downstairs, the lasting impression is the architect's work itself: the oak chairs that resemble small buildings; the tall dressers designed as architectural columns, and the lead-glass windows with bright balloons, confetti and flags that recall a day at a parade.</p><p>Photos of Frank Lloyd Wright; a t-shirt, plate and rug designed by Wright; a reproduction of Wright's high-back Robie Chair (pg. C1); Thomas Monaghan; lead glass window; drafting studio in Wright's house (NYT/Fred R. Conrad); drawing of the Richard Bock Studio House (pg.
