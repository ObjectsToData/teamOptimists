                    <p>SURROUNDED BY COMPUT-er gear, Federal personnel directories, and the requisite framed, signed photograph of himself with Ronald Reagan, Louis J. Cordia describes his predicament. ''I've probably got a hundred people in the Administration calling me,'' he complains. ''They're telling me, 'I'm looking to move into the private sector, and I understand you have that kind of operation.' I say to them again and again, 'We'll keep you in mind when a vacancy opens.' ''</p><p>As the Reagan Administration winds down, Cordia's job as director of the executive branch liaison for the Heritage Foundation - Washington's leading conservative think tank -has been transformed. Once his mission at Heritage was straightforward: to help groom a new generation of conservatives for public service and to place them in Government. ''Our job is to tap policy experts here and push them into power in the Administration,'' Cordia told The New Republic in 1985.</p><p>At the time, Cordia was known around Washington as the head of the New Right's personnel office. Through a network of conservatives already in the on job vacancies, sometimes even before the White House personnel office. In 1985 alone he claimed to have helped place about 250 conservatives in Administration jobs. His efforts were part of Heritage's declared ambition to create a ''conservative infrastructure'' within the Government, a new elite whose influence would be felt long after Reagan passed from power.</p><p>It hasn't happened. Today, conservatives in good standing are still waiting on hold to get through to Cordia's office. But most are seeking his help in leaving the Government, and Heritage has adjusted its strategy accordingly. Of the 20,000 jobs Cordia now tracks with his Compaq computer, more than three-quarters are in the private sector.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Cordia takes comfort in the thought that many of the conservatives he once helped place in Government jobs will at least remain in Washington as lobbyists. ''The great number of former Reagan appointees are still in government-relations jobs,'' he says, ''forming their own consulting businesses in town, or working in the private sector as government-relation liaisons.'' But Cordia, along with most other conservatives, concedes that they have largely failed to penetrate what they call ''the permanent government'' - the vast network of career bureaucrats, Federal judges, and Washington insiders who retain powerful positions, often for life.</p><p>Ronald Reagan will leave behind a generation of conservatives who have direct experience in government, and who will be available to serve again should one of their own recapture the White House. But few are interested in government service as a career, and those who are have by and large moderated their hard-core views.</p><p>''The real right wingers who used to be around aren't visible any more,'' says Andrew Feinstein, staff director and chief counsel of the House Subcommittee on Civil Service. Ray Kline, president of the National Academy of Public Administration, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization chartered by Congress to study Federal personnel issues, agrees. ''If you look across the board at all the many different cultures of the Federal government, you just have to say that there has been no deep penetration. If that is what conservatives intended, it just hasn't happened.''</p><p>WHEN ASKED WHAT SURPRISED her most about coming to work for the White House, Laura A. Ingraham, 24, replies: ''What a big office they gave me!'' Accustomed to working out of a cubicle at the Department of Education, Miss Ingraham suddenly found herself - as a confidential assistant to Gary Bauer, the White House Domestic Policy adviser - occupying ''an office the size most chief executive officers have in the private sector.''</p><p>In the Old Executive Office Building is Dinesh D'Souza, 26, a senior policy analyst for Bauer. A native of India, D'Souza is formal, intense and still speaks with a slight accent. Along with Miss Ingraham and White House speech writer Peter M. Robinson, D'Souza is among the most prominent members of the so-called ''Dartmouth mafia'' - an informal network of young conservatives, most of whom met in the early 1980's while working for the highly controversial right-wing campus newspaper, The Dartmouth Review.</p><p>D'Souza was the Review's second editor-in-chief; Miss Ingraham later assumed his mantle. Since its founding in 1980, the paper has repeatedly made national news by publishing satires and diatribes that provoked blacks, homosexuals, American Indians and other minorities, as well as the Dartmouth faculty. The most notorious article was the so-called ''jive column,'' an Op-Ed piece against affirmative action written as a parody of Black English. Today, D'Souza stresses that he was only a teen-ager at the time, but has no apologies. ''We realized something the left realized, that there's an importance in being exhibitionist and in being lively, and in being anti-establishment, which The Review has been since day one.''</p><p>The conservative movement has invested heavily in nurturing young conservatives like Miss Ingraham and D'Souza. As undergraduates, they managed to obtain funding for The Dartmouth Review from the John M. Olin Foundation and the Institute for Educational Affairs, which funds several dozen other conservative campus papers around the country. And they have both participated in, and spoken before, the Third Generation Project, a network of young conservatives, sponsored by Heritage, who meet every two weeks to hear lectures and trade job information. The Heritage Foundation directly boosted D'Souza's career by naming him managing editor of its journal, Policy Review, when D'Souza was only 24. There, he attracted the attention of Gary Bauer, who took the risk of bringing both D'Souza and Miss Ingraham with him to the White House to work on politically sensitive issues like abortion and school prayer.</p>                </div>
