                    <p>A veteran administrator of the City University system was chosen yesterday to become president of Hunter College, one of the most academically prestigious branches of the City University of New York. And in a second, surprising appointment, a Harvard scholar and internationally known explorer was named the new president of Medgar Evers College, a small and troubled community college in central Brooklyn.</p><p>The City University's board of trustees made the appointments at its last meeting of the academic year. '86 Expedition</p><p>Acting on the recommendation of the university's chancellor, Dr. Joseph S. Murphy, the board named Dr. S. Allen Counter, a 43-year-old Harvard University neurophysiologist and the director of the Harvard Foundation, to become the third president of Medgar Evers. He won wide public attention in 1986 for finding, in northern Greenland, the 80-year-old sons of Robert E. Peary and Matthew A. Henson, the two men who were the first to reach the North Pole.</p><p>The board also named Dr. Paul LeClerc, the 47-year-old provost of Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University, to succeed Dr. Donna E. Shalala, becoming the 12th president of Hunter. Dr. LeClerc is a member of the doctoral faculty of the Graduate Center of the City University and has written extensively on Voltaire and the Enlightenment.

                    <p>The 17-member board also voted to make the novelist Philip Roth a visiting distinguished professor at Hunter College for the 1988-89 academic year.</p><p>City University officials and faculty members at Medgar Evers were stunned that someone of Dr. Counter's background would agree to assume the post. Both previous presidents were beset with a host of administrative problems and were forced from office by faculty and student protests.</p><p>''He's just an ideal choice,'' said Dr. Nolan A. Thaxton, the chairman of the faculty panel that participated in the search process. ''I just hope he can provide the kind of leadership and enthusiasm to put this school back on its feet.''</p><p>Dr. Counter was in Sweden yesterday and unavailable for comment. But those who have spoken with him say Dr. Counter had told them that having spent his academic career at elite institutions, he now wanted to make some a meaningful contribution to the education of minority students.</p><p>Medgar Evers College, in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, was established in 1971 as a four-year liberal arts school but, for budgetary reasons, was made a two-year community college during the city's fiscal crisis in 1976.</p><p>Its 2,600 students are mostly black, female and poor. Three years ago, the college was caught up in a financial aid scandal in which it was discovered that a substantial number of students had been illegallly receiving Federal grants despite failing academic records. Rain Forest Dwellers</p><p>Dr. Counter received his doctorate from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He holds faculty positions at both Harvard College and Harvard Medical School in addition to being an associate neurophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. The Harvard Foundation, of which he is the director, presents academic and cultural programs for students who are members of minority groups.</p><p>In addition to his finding the descendants of Commodore Peary and Mr. Henson, Dr. Counter also is noted for his discovery in 1971 of a group of rain forest dwellers in northern Brazil, Surinam and French Guiana who were descendants of African slaves who escaped from slave ships.</p><p>The selection of Dr. LeClerc for the Hunter presidency is expected to disappoint a vocal segment of the Hunter College faculty, which had been lobbying heavily on behalf of Dr. Thomas F. George, a distinguished physical chemist who is currently dean of natural sciences and mathematics at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 'Everything Going for It'</p><p>But CUNY officials say Dr. Murphy leaned toward Dr. LeClerc because of his wider administrative experience and also because his academic background was more in keeping with Hunter's traditional strengths in the humanities.</p><p>''Hunter is simply not a big science school,'' one official explained.</p><p>Dr. LeClerc, who has earned wide respect as provost and vice president for academic affairs since going to Baruch in 1984, earned a doctorate in French from Columbia University and previously served as university dean of academic affairs and as acting vice chancellor for academic affairs of the City University.</p><p>Reached yesterday by telephone, Dr. LeClerc said he had applied for the job because the ''Hunter presidency is one of the great academic jobs nationally. This is a school that has everything going for it.''</p><p>Dr. LeClerc said he would take the next few months to ''talk to a lot of faculty members, students and alumni to see what our common agenda should be.''</p><p>Hunter College was established in 1870 and is the oldest branch of the City University after the City College of New York and was originally a women's school. Hunter is the largest branch of the university, with an enrollment of 19,000 students.</p><p>Both Dr. Counter and Dr. LeClerc are expected to take up their new posts Sept. 1. Their salaries will be $111,000 a year.</p><p>photos of Dr. S. Allen Counter (AP); Paul LeClerc (Robert Glick) (pg. B5)</p>                </div>
