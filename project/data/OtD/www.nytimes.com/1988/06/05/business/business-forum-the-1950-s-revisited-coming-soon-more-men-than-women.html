                    <p>AN important demographic trend is pointing to the resurgence of traditional family life with wide implications for the economy and business. The trend is the changing sex ratio among eligible males and females. Some of the immediate consequences of this change will be an increase in birth rates in the 1990's, and a resurgence of the conventional family by the year 2000 (father working, mother at home with the children) from today's 28 percent of all households, to the 1960's level of 44 percent.</p><p>The sex ratio compares the number of males in a population to the number of females. Among marriageable Americans over 20 years of age, there has been a scarcity of males and an abundance of females. Without enough men to go around there has been a ''marriage squeeze'' for females.</p><p>But the sex ratio among Americans in their 20's is now reversing. From now through the 21st century, there will be a surplus of males and an undersupply of females. The marriage and family markets are about to heat up.</p><p>For two decades there has been a shortage of eligible males largely due to the baby boom - the 75 million Americans born between 1947 and 1964. The reason is that first- time bridegrooms tend to marry women who are two to three years younger. This trend has remained constant for decades. And since each year of the baby boom until 1957 saw a larger number of births than the previous year, each age group of older males sought partners among a younger and larger group of females. This meant that the number of older men was too small for the larger group of younger women. But once the largest group of baby boomers passed through its 20's - which happened in 1987 - then the younger, remaining baby boom males had to begin looking for their female companions from among a smaller group of females from the post 1957 ''baby bust'' generation. For these men, finding wives two to three years younger will not be as easy as it was in the past.</p>                </div>

                    <p>When men outnumber women, life in America is likely to be quite different. When eligible men are comparatively rare, there is a tendency for them to exploit the situation. In such a society, according to University of Houston social scientists Marcia Guttentag and Paul Secord, men have multiple relationships with women and become less willing to commit themselves to one woman in marriage. But when young males are more numerous than females, the situation turns around and men are more eager to pursue marriage.</p><p>Professors Guttentag and Secord examined several societies with a preponderance of males and concluded that when women are scarce and men readily available, a protective morality develops that favors monogamy for women, limits their interactions with men, and shapes female roles in traditional domestic directions. This is the pattern in most of the third world, especially in the Muslim countries, where men outnumber women. When men compete for a smaller number of women, the average age at first marriage is driven down. Marriage and birth rates climb. Homemaking becomes a primary activity at the expense of female participation in the labor force.</p><p>The study by Professors Guttentag and Secord was published in 1983, right after the sex ratio for people in their 20's had passed the point of parity - 100 males for every 100 females. But the number of males must rise somewhat above parity, they wrote, before there are discernible social effects - and that is precisely what is beginning to happen.</p><p>Are there any signs that the transformation is beginning? Indeed there are. For the past three years the average age at first marriage for women has been dropping, a signal that their relative undersupply is being felt. Between 1986 and 1987, for the first time in 20 years, the number of family households grew faster than the number of non-family households. And in 1987, a rise in the birth rate resulted in the largest number of births since 1964. At the same time, the divorce rate fell to its lowest level in 12 years.</p><p>In the decade to come, marriage and birth rates are likely to rise for several years before any change in the female labor force participation rate is observed. But a preponderance of males over females is likely to have an effect not unlike what happened shortly after World War II, when women in large numbers left the work force to start families.</p><p>Should changes occur as forecasted, a large number of industries will be affected. Romance and courtship will be back in favor, so sales of cut flowers are sure to rise.</p><p>After 20 years of declining sales, companies that cater to the baby-care market will see strong demand for their products. Infant food, toys, clothing and furniture will be soon become growth industries.</p><p>IN this scenario, the picture is not quite so rosy for the housing industry, however. A rise in family formations means a decline in the number of households, since fewer people will be living alone (currently about one fourth of all households are single-person). Not only will there be reduced demand for new units, but there will also be pressure for less costly housing if fewer women are bringing home a paycheck.</p><p>The new marrieds will be allocating dollars for the improvement of their homebound leisure activities. Systems that get movies into living rooms by one means or another will do well, and so will subscription magazines and recreational equipment for families with children.</p><p>Vacations will involve travel to sites of family recreation. The national parks are going to be even more heavily used, and Disneyland will find others trying to move in on its expanding market. The travel will be done in mid-sized vehicles; the family van is the wave of the future.</p><p>The food industry in the 1990's will have to base its prosperity on whether or not the women of America are working. Initially the fast food outlets will do very well, but a return to homemaking will mean a rise in supermarket sales. Finally, all these new families will have to be protected - the insurance industry can only thrive under these conditions.</p><p>A new traditionalism, centered on family life, is in the offing as the sex ratios change and men outnumber women. Those businesses that prepare themselves for this will fare the best in the 1990's and beyond.</p><p>Graph of ratio of men to women, 1973-2000 (Source: Census Bureau)</p>                </div>
