                    <p>''It just shows you,'' he said, ''that as a teacher you often never really know the tremendous impact you can have on your students.'' Group of 35 Seniors</p><p>The occasion for the two days of receptions, seminars, and remembrances that ended today was Cornell's Presidential Scholars award ceremony, held to recognize the high grades and extracurricular achievements of a select group of 35 of the university's 2,800 graduating seniors.</p><p>The five-year-old program has always identified those Cornell faculty members the students said most inspired them.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, Cornell administrators asked the students to identify their most inspiring high-school teachers as well.</p><p>The university, at its expense, invited the teachers to the campus as part of weeklong festivities that are to culminate Sunday in its commencement. Invitation Arrives by Messenger</p><p>Twenty-five of the teachers, whose subjects range from physical education to calculus, came to the scenic, hilly campus from as far away as California, Oklahoma, Indiana and Maryland.</p><p>''I am just thrilled to be here,'' said Beverly Griffith, a mathematics teachers from Glendora (Calif.) High School.</p><p>She had come at the invitation of Randall Verhoef, a chemical-engineering major who next fall will be in graduate school closer to home, at the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>Mrs. Griffith, who has taught for 32 years, said with delight that the special invitation from Cornell had been delivered to her classroom by messenger, and news of it, once she informed her principal, had spread quickly among her colleagues, the city school board, and the local news organizations.</p><p>''It caused a great reaction,'' she said. ''Everyone thought it was a great honor.''</p><p>Mr. Verhoef, in a comment that reflected the views of his classmates, said the honor for Mrs. Griffith was long overdue.</p><p>''She had so much enthusiasm in class, she made learning so interesting; we had fun learning calculus,'' he said, recalling that Mrs. Griffith had a decidely pixieish personality that she used to charm and inspire students.</p><p>He said her teaching technique included such innovations as ''classroom coupons,'' which were earned for excellent work. They gave students the privilege of leaving class early or being late to class without penalty or, the utlimate, their favorite candy bar.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Verhoef spoke of Mrs. Griffith's ''absolute dedication and discipline'' in teaching mathematics. ''There was no doubt that you were in her class to learn,'' he said.</p><p>Not surprisingly, that combination of discipline, intellectual rigor and concern for the student's personal well-being was a common theme when students spoke of why the teachers were so important to them. 'A Good Friend'</p><p>''She's always been a good friend, always been available,'' said Debora Wood, an art major, of Laurie Kenney Franzese, her humanities teacher from Bishop McGuiness High School in Oklahoma City, whose class she first took as a high-school freshman.</p><p>''She emphasized taking the broad view, not just of literature, but of all of American culture,'' Ms. Wood said, ''and I've continued that approach at Cornell.''</p><p>In recent years a number of colleges, including Georgetown University and Williams College, have begun honoring secondary-school teachers at graduation or other universitywide exercises.</p><p>Educators at Cornell and elsewhere said that Cornell's effort apparently was the largest of those in terms of the number of teachers honored at one time.</p><p>Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said such programs are ''a deliberate effort by the colleges to say they benefit from having well-prepared students.''</p><p>''They've taken this for granted in the past,'' he continued, ''and now they're publicly acknowledging that's been an oversight.''</p><p>Theodore Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, said such efforts also stemmed from the interest many colleges now have in establishing collaborative educational programs with public school systems.</p><p>Frank H. T. Rhodes, Cornell's president, alluded to those considerations in saying today that one purpose of the awards was ''to emphasize the continuity of teaching, not just in the conveyance of knowledge, but in the inspiration of students as well.''</p><p>''Teachers have been getting beat up lately,'' he continued, referring to numerous reports that public school teachers as a group are held in low esteem by the general public. ''We wanted to point out that many are worthy of praise, and say that we value what they're doing and respect what they've done for our students.''</p><p>Cornell awarded the teachers Certificates of Distinction, not honorary degrees as some colleges have done, because Cornell does not award honorary degrees.</p><p>''Many of us do sense that the profession is undervalued, that people think we don't do much all day,'' said Arlene Lackenauer, a guidance counselor at Edison (N.J.) High School who was invited by an architecture major.</p><p>''So, this does mean a great deal,'' Mrs. Lackenauer said of the Cornell award. ''Cornell is saying to us that because of us, it's getting some of its best students. My colleagues couldn't believe a university would do something like this.''</p><p>Photo of Randall Verhoef and Beverly Griffith (NYT/Tim McKinney)</p>                </div>
