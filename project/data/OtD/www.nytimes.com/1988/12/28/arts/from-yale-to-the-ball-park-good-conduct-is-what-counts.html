Bartlett Giamatti, one of the country's leading authorities on Dante, Spenser's ''Faerie Queene'' and the nuances of baseball's balk rule, is the author of a new book called ''A Free and Ordered Space: The Real World of the University.'' Its wide-ranging ideas prove that even after trading the campus for the diamond he's still a Renaissance man.</p><p>The former president of Yale, now president of the National League and beginning next season the commissioner of baseball, sat in his Park Avenue office the other day and talked about education, literature, theater, movies and, of course, baseball.</p><p>''I used to be able to sit in the dugout during the Yale games,'' he said. ''I thought of it as my franchise, and they still let me do so.''</p><p>''But I obviously can't sit with one of the big league ball clubs or it would look like favoritism,'' he said wistfully, sounding like a closet Boston Red Sox fan. Although the most frequently consulted volume on his desk these days is the Official Rules of Baseball, he continues to keep his hand in as a scholar.

                    <p>A word that keeps coming up in his conversation and his book is civility. He's for it - on and off the playing field. But he also holds strong views about the need for the freedom of conflicting ideas in the university.</p><p>Mr. Giamatti believes that William J. Bennett, the former Secretary of Education, and Allan Bloom, the University of Chicago philosophy professor who wrote the best seller ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' have both been wrongheaded in their warnings against the state of American universities and the lack of emphasis on teaching the basic subjects necessary for a well-rounded education.</p><p>''Bill Bennett has been flailing the colleges for the last few years, and the tone of Professor Bloom's book is mean-spirited,'' Mr. Giamatti said. ''I don't think information and education are the same; that's a notion that Bennett has exploited. He's on a mission to reform our souls. I don't have any problems with reformation, but these neo-Puritans make me very nervous. Bloom has been traumatized by the 60's. Everyone was, but it's 20 years later now. He has this kind of supply-side, trickle-down theory of education. The notion that American higher education has let down American democracy strikes me as bizarre.'' And Mr. Giamatti's Book</p><p>Did he consider his book a counterweight to Messrs. Bennett and Bloom?</p><p>''Yes, but without necessarily taking them on on their own ground,'' said Mr. Giamatti, who is 50 years old and lives in New Haven. ''Mine is another perspective. If you read Allan Bloom, you'd never think that the American university had any life outside the philosophy department. His view of the classics and mine are not the same. I don't limit a classic education to a particular list of books or subjects. The whole point of education is to have a variety of competing voices, not a single chorus. To mix a yeasty feisty debate and exchange ideas, the universities have to speak up or there will only be these other sounds.''</p><p>Mr. Giamatti's book, which was published by W. W. Norton, has three parts: the nature and purpose of a university, which he believes has not been explained adequately by university officials; the goals and principles of a liberal education (he is strongly in favor of the humanities instead of emphasizing vocationalism), and the affiliation of the university and government, private industry and other institutions (he says the university should follow ''an independent path for the nation's good''). All the Free and Ordered Spaces</p><p>As an expert on the Renaissance, what did he think the classics had to do with the free and ordered space of the university world today?</p><p>''The Renaissance drew upon the ancient view that the purpose of education is to create a good citizen,'' Mr. Giammati said. ''That is not a theme any less vital now than it was 500 years ago. The purpose was intellectual training for civil goals and a broadly educated mind - almost to toughen the mind as a muscle. This would prepare you for the problems that the world would confront you with.</p><p>''Even the act of creating a work of literature had an ethical purpose for Dante, Spenser, Milton and Shakespeare. It isn't necessary to accept Dante's doctrinal religious framework, but there is a moral perspective to his writing. I've always found it immensely satisfying that literature has an ethical impulse.''</p><p>Mr. Giamatti said he did not find a great difference between running Yale and the National League. In both cases, people try to fulfill their gifts in ''a free and ordered space.''</p><p>''The university world is a marketplace of ideas essential to the welfare of society,'' he said. ''The ball park is a creative place where people come to take their pleasure by watching players doing their utmost. Wherever, you have to have a sense of order for individual freedom to exist. What always intrigued me about baseball is the relationship of the individual to the group. It's very much an individual sport that you play as a team member, but it isn't a team sport the way football is, where 11 men move on a prearranged signal. Baseball has a random serendipitous nature.''</p><p>Mr. Giamatti reached for the baseball rule book and flipped the pages until he found what he was looking for.</p><p>''There's a wonderful phrase here about the role of the umpire,'' he said. ''It says that his job is to maintain 'the good conduct of the game.' It's almost a Renaissance phrase. I spend a lot of time talking with the umpires because they are the extension of the league on the field. I was just as worried about 'the good conduct of the game' at Yale as here. Allowing people the freedom to behave to their potential is what you would call the glory of the game.'' Baseball Books and Movies</p><p>Mr. Giamatti has read and seen some of the baseball novels and movies. His favorite is Mark Harris's ''Bang the Drum Slowly.'' He found the movie ''Bull Durham'' fun because it captured the flavor of the minor leagues. He liked the movie version of Bernard Malamud's ''Natural''; he thought the novel was remarkable but found its mythology puzzling.</p><p>''There are marvelous histories of baseball that are really social histories of the country,'' he said. ''More and more I see citations used from baseball archives. The baseball records are sitting there and are a wonderful source for historians. Baseball is one of the free-standing institutions that has survived without radical changes since before the Civil War. It's one of the things that keeps the country together - a kind of lingua franca.''</p><p>Photo of A. Bartlett Giamatti (DOT/Brad Trent)</p>                </div>
