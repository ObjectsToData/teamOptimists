                    <p>''The humanities may not receive as much attention as politics but they are alive and well in Washington,'' Hermione de Almeida said from her study in the Smithsonian Institution's red sandstone castle on the Mall.</p><p>In addition to artifacts, the Smithsonian collects minds, and Ms. de Almeida's is one of them. She is a Keats scholar, at work on a book on the connection of dreams to the early 19th-century Romantic art of Keats and his circle. She is also one of 70 writers, academics and men and women of public affairs currently in residence as Fellows of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p><p>Since its establishment 20 years ago by Congress as a memorial to the scholar-President Woodrow Wilson, more than 1,200 Wilson fellows have spent periods of four months to two years in the serenity of the Wilson Center.</p><p>Washington is often regarded as a city of ''how-to'' political thinkers rather than intellectuals. But the Wilson scholar is not in the business of marketing another answer to the crisis of the day, according to Charles Blitzer, the center's director. Pressures in Capital</p>                </div>

                    <p>''The pressures are very great in Washington to be policy oriented,'' said Mr. Blitzer, who served as assistant secretary for history and art at the Smithsonian from 1968 to 1983. He went to the Wilson Center four months ago, replacing James H. Billington, who left to become the Librarian of Congress.</p><p>''There is a well-known saying that Washington is a city in which what is urgent takes precedence over what is important,'' he observed, ''but one of the hallmarks of the center is that it takes a somewhat longer view of issues than some other institutions. It has a historical perspective and doesn't try to respond to today's headlines or try to anticipate tomorrow's.''</p><p>That could hardly be disputed. Adimado Messan Aduayom from the Republic of Togo, for example, is analyzing the Atlantic trade and cultural mutation on the slave coast in the 16th to 19th centuries. Feodor M. Burlatsky, of Moscow's Academy of Social Sciences, is exploring the mutual perceptions and misunderstandings of John F. Kennedy and Nikita S. Khrushchev.</p><p>Hugo Hiriart, a Mexican writer, is working on a novel on the conquest of Mexico. Knud Haakonssen of Australia is tracing the evolution of ''natural law to the rights of man.'' And Hua Qingzhao, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, is focusing on the dynamics of Harry S. Truman's diplomacy. Moynihan's Long View</p><p>In helping to write the proposal for the center many years ago, according to Mr. Blitzer, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, envisioned it as an institution that the 22d century would judge as having had a beneficent influence on the 21st. The legislation specifically called for a center that would strengthen the relationship between the world of learning and the world of public affairs.</p><p>To that end, members of Congress, Cabinet officers and Administration officials are regularly invited to participate in the center's evening dialogues, noon discussions and conferences on such subjects as ''Lessons from the Fall and Rise of Nations'' and ''The Psychology of Terrorism.''</p><p>''It is as if there is a permanent kind of graduate school going on in Washington for any member of Congress who might like to take advantage of it,'' said Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford.</p><p>Never before, Mr. Bradley noted, has Washington been thought of as a stopping-off point for intellectuals. ''I think the center creates a balance in Washington that goes beyond government and the political,'' he added. ''Their programs and their presence remind people that it is important to get it right and think before you act -that rigorous thought is the best insurance of good policy. It gives context for the policy maker.'' Unexpected Result</p><p>Judge Robert H. Bork, a former member of the center's board, was a recent participant in a conference on constitutional law and history. On another occasion this summer a paper presented by Shai Feldman on David Ben Gurion's strategic vision for Israel was brought to the attention of Secretary of State George P. Shultz by a State Department official who had sat in on the conference.</p><p>''The next thing we know, we get a call from Secretary Shultz asking Feldman to come over for lunch,'' said Mr. Blitzer. ''It is just a capsule of another kind of thing that happens here - nobody planned that. I expect if we had put that paper in an envelope and addressed it to The Honorable George P. Shultz it would never have been seen again.''</p><p>More than half the current scholars come from abroad and they represent a variety of disciplines. The center's program areas include history, culture and society; American society and politics; international security studies and studies focusing on Latin America, Asia and Eastern and Western Europe. The 1989 Federal appropriation of $4.2 million for the center represents 45 percent of the center's budget, with the balance coming from grants, donations and income from the center's publications.</p><p>Sherry hours are held twice a week before lunch in the common dining room. Each fellow is expected to present work at a weekly conference for comment and criticism. The center is also home for the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies, developed by George F. Kennan, a former fellow who is an expert on the Soviet Union. 'We Create a Community'</p><p>''We give them peace and quiet to pursue their research,'' observed Mr. Blitzer, ''but the very heart of this place is that we create a community. One of the fascinating things about coming to these open forums is not only hearing a variety of points of view but you never know exactly how it is going to come out. We have all shades of opinion.''</p><p>Since 1976 the center has published The Wilson Quarterly, a national review of ideas and information that draws upon the work of both current and former fellows. The center has also just published its 13th volume in a series of guides to the bibliographic, archival, museum, art, academic and organization resources of the capital.</p><p>''There is an unbelievable wealth of material in this city,'' said Mr. Blitzer. ''We want to let people know what is available here and we want to pay particular attention to linking these institutions. There are many things we could do together.''</p><p>Mr. Blitzer is also eager to give the center a higher profile with a building of its own as originally called for. The legislation is quite precise, calling for the inclusion of ''an exterior classic frieze memorial to Woodrow Wilson.''</p><p>Mr. Blitzer and the center's Presidentially appointed board have been exploring a number of sites but the most serious possibility, he said, is the proposed United States International Cultural and Trade Center at the Federal Triangle, a 2.5 million-square-foot Federal complex that will complete the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>''It is a very complicated enterprise,'' said Mr. Blitzer. ''I've been in touch with boards and committees and commission and councils and whatnot, and we have received a uniformly warm and welcoming response from them all. But it remains to be seen if the architect who is given the job responds to our view of the particular needs of this institution as a Presidential memorial. We are utterly unenthusiastic about the notion that we would once again become the west end of the third floor of some other building.''</p><p>photo of Charles Blitzer and Hermione de Almeida (NYT/Jose R.
