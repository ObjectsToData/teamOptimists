    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Television can do interesting things when it has to; public television can do some of the most interesting things of all. As it happens, public television is having a very interesting season, although, as is often the case in public television, our attention is deflected by other things. ''The Africans'' attracts attention because it is denounced by the National Endowment for the Humanities. A literacy campaign on public television attracts attention through its own self-promotion. At the same time, observers note, public television has no smashing new dramatic series. Where is this season's ''Jewel in the Crown''? Public television seems to be off to an abysmal year.   In fact, this is not so; the season would be a success if it offered nothing more than ''The Story of English.'' The nine-part series is public television at its best, a reflection of the original reasons the system was conceived. In 1967, the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television issued the report that led to the establishment of public broadcasting as we now know it. In those early days, confidence was unbounded; the future had no limit. The commission had declared that television should, and easily could, be enlisted in the service of all good things. Public television, the commission declared, ''will be, in short, a civilized voice in a civilized community.''">

                    Television can do interesting things when it has to; public television can do some of the most interesting things of all. As it happens, public television is having a very interesting season, although, as is often the case in public television, our attention is deflected by other things. ''The Africans'' attracts attention because it is denounced by the National Endowment for the Humanities. A literacy campaign on public television attracts attention through its own self-promotion. At the same time, observers note, public television has no smashing new dramatic series. Where is this season's ''Jewel in the Crown''? Public television seems to be off to an abysmal year.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In fact, this is not so; the season would be a success if it offered nothing more than ''The Story of English.'' The nine-part series is public television at its best, a reflection of the original reasons the system was conceived. In 1967, the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television issued the report that led to the establishment of public broadcasting as we now know it. In those early days, confidence was unbounded; the future had no limit. The commission had declared that television should, and easily could, be enlisted in the service of all good things. Public television, the commission declared, ''will be, in short, a civilized voice in a civilized community.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The experience of almost 20 years suggests that the commission report was roseate. In real life, one person's civilized voice is another's ranting. At the same time, there is no final consensus on what makes up a civilized community, although there are some generally agreed-upon definitions, and most people know a civilized voice when they hear one. As the Carnegie Commission also said, a civilized voice on public television will give us a ''fuller awareness of the wonder and variety of the arts, the sciences, scholarship and craftsmanship, and of the many roads along which the products of man's mind and man's hands can be encountered.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Grant that the commission was being a little windy there; its heart was in the right place. Civilized television has civilized values, and this season public television has found them. Tomorrow night in consecutive hours, for example, Channel 13 offers ''The Story of English'' and ''The West of the Imagination.'' On Tuesday night, it continues with ''Managing Our Miracles: Health Care in America.'' All three series are civilized; all three series are new. Each in its way is what public television is supposed to be all about. It is unlikely that anything like them would ever appear on a major commercial network.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The Story of English'' has been a delight to the eye and the ear since it started, even though its topic - the growth and dissemination of the English language - is the stuff of which dry, dusty seminars can be made. Tomorrow night's episode, ''Black on White,'' traces the evolution of black American English from the West Coast of Africa 300 years ago to our cities today. It visits, among other places, the Sea Islands of Georgia, where Gullah is spoken. Gullah is the form of English - or the ''variety'' of English, as the series calls it - that first was spoken by African slaves.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The program's special mark of distinction here is that it does not treat either Gullah or the people who speak it as especially quaint or anachronistic. Gullah has a logic, syntax and history of its own. Later, the program visits Philadelphia, the home, says Robert MacNeil, the host and co-author of the series, of some ''ghetto Homers.'' He is talking here about rap, a form of musicalized speech that I have always thought of as deficient in the merits of either music or speech. The program persuades me I was wrong. Rap has something to offer. ''The Story of English'' fulfills the Carnegie Commission's old mandate about giving us a ''fuller awareness of the wonder and vitality of the arts'' and leading us down new roads. The series is a triumph.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The West of the Imagination'' is not in the same league as ''The Story of English,'' but that's not because it's not trying. It is ambitious, imaginative and often visually beautiful. It traces the myth of the American West -cowboys, Indians, noble deeds, terrible outrages -through the artists who shaped it. The artists in tomorrow night's program, Frederic Remington and Charley Russell, are seen in re-enacted episodes (Remington, for example, muses about his art; Russell, who looks like Will Rogers, sits in saloons and sketches), along with examples of their work.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The series does take itself too seriously at times; it's not absolutely necessary to have the discussion between the host, James Whitmore, and William H. Goetzmann, the historian who first thought of the series, at the end of each program. On the other hand, the discussions are brief, and ''The West of the Imagination'' does not treat the artists like icons. In tomorrow night's episode, Jerome Dempsey, who plays the overweight Remington, huffs and puffs across Yellowstone Park; a nervous Owen Wister stumbles along in his wake. As art history this may not be absolutely accurate, but it does make art history easy to take.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    And finally there is ''Managing Our Miracles: Health Care in America,'' a 10-part series that examines great questions of life and death. If this is not important, it is hard to think of what is. Experts join in panel discussions, guided by feisty moderators. Panel discussions do not attract huge numbers of viewers, but they are still one of television's most useful formats. Voices are heard; points of view are expressed. ''Managing our Miracles'' - Channel 13 was involved in its production; it was also involved in ''The Story of English'' - is an entirely provocative series. Who said the season is not a success?        </p>
