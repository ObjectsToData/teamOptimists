    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  There is a story about Leopold von Ranke, the 19th-century German historian regarded as the father of modern ''professional'' history writing - that at the age of 91 he lay down on his pine bed and gently chided his amanuensis, Theodor Wiedemann, for having fallen asleep at his pen the night before. Ranke had been trying to finish dictating the eighth volume of his sweeping ''Universal History,'' which he had begun writing at the age of 82. But the eyes would not stay open and the ''Universal History'' would never be finished.   ''If your strength had only held out last night,'' the mummy-like Ranke told poor Wiedemann, ''we could have finished our work; it's spread out before me in panorama; but it is too late; I am weary.'' And the great Ranke soon died, taking his panorama with him into what he once imagined would be the great archives of heaven.   This happened in 1886, and because of the roundness of that anniversary -and also because Ranke's private library of more than 20,000 volumes ended up at Syracuse University - an international conference of scholars gathered here recently to talk about Ranke's place in the history of history.">

                    <strong>SYRACUSE, N.Y.&mdash; </strong>
                    There is a story about Leopold von Ranke, the 19th-century German historian regarded as the father of modern ''professional'' history writing - that at the age of 91 he lay down on his pine bed and gently chided his amanuensis, Theodor Wiedemann, for having fallen asleep at his pen the night before. Ranke had been trying to finish dictating the eighth volume of his sweeping ''Universal History,'' which he had begun writing at the age of 82. But the eyes would not stay open and the ''Universal History'' would never be finished.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''If your strength had only held out last night,'' the mummy-like Ranke told poor Wiedemann, ''we could have finished our work; it's spread out before me in panorama; but it is too late; I am weary.'' And the great Ranke soon died, taking his panorama with him into what he once imagined would be the great archives of heaven.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This happened in 1886, and because of the roundness of that anniversary -and also because Ranke's private library of more than 20,000 volumes ended up at Syracuse University - an international conference of scholars gathered here recently to talk about Ranke's place in the history of history.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    History as Science        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Some participants in the conference insisted, as people do at such events, that Ranke's spirit and beneficent influence were still very much alive. His name did not ring the great bells rung by Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and other thinkers and writers in German over the last century or so; and indeed Ranke is ''a name normally unknown in this world,'' one elderly German-born scholar confessed.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Yet in his field Ranke left a deep impression and became known to historians as ''the Master.'' For it was Ranke, in half a century's tenure at the University of Berlin, who spread the word through 54 volumes and many lectures and many students that history must be based on documents, that history is science as well as literature. The proper historian, in his view, is an academic trained and judged by other academics all dedicated to the collective enterprise of reconstructing ''what actually happened,'' as one of Ranke's famous dictums put it.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The gathering was also notable, however, for the doubts and cautions it raised. Peter Burke of Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge argued that the great Ranke was an influential reactionary rather than a creator of new intellectual forms.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He was reacting, said Mr. Burke, against the historians of the 18th century, who had experimented in social and economic history of a sort that has become popular again only in the latter half of the 20th century. The 18th century not only was characterized by the vast philosophical speculations of brilliant gentlemen-historians such as Voltaire and Gibbon, but also was curious about the Orient, about manners and morals, about international trade and other matters that are intellectually fashionable again two centuries later. (In 1779, in fact, the historian William Alexander published a ''History of Women.'') 'Cut Off in Their Prime'        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Burke said all these 18th-century developments ''were cut off in their prime'' by the narrower, if more methodical, focus of men like Ranke, who saw historiography mainly in terms of official government documents, elite politics, matters of state and foreign affairs.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The two distinguished Italian historians at the conference, Gino Benzoni and Ugo Tucci, both from Venice, suggested that Ranke's favorite documentary sources - the relazioni of the Venetian ambassadors, reports to the Venetian Senate after returning home from Europe's various capitals - were not objective contemporary records, as Ranke tended to assume, but highly stylized reflections of what the Venetian Senate wanted to hear. Moreover, the Venetian manuscripts Ranke purchased were scarcely a scientific sample spanning the centuries; they were samples, rather, from the libraries of those Venetian families that chose to sell off their patrimony to pay their bills.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Ranke was also partly responsible for the modern academic industry that produces huge numbers of historical monographs and doctoral dissertations that are so specialized they are rarely read and that are so piecemeal they give a would-be reader of history a sense of extreme fragmentation. True, Ranke himself was a literary stylist who kept his eye on the big picture as well as on the details. 'Becoming Modish Once Again'        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But it was his stress on evidence and the slow accumulation of minute details that made him venerated in the new university-based discipline of history. It was no accident, moreover, that Ranke became the first honorary member of the American Historical Association.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Alas, several scholars added between the three-day meeting's lectures, Ranke's immensely diligent histories of France, England, Germany and the Popes are rarely read today even by professional historians. They are sufficiently outdated that there is no professional need to read them.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Several scholars also noted that, for all his objectivity, Ranke was politically quite conservative. He saw monarchy as Europe's destiny and had no sympathy for the lower strata of society. The ''neo-Rankean'' German historians who followed him, said Wolfgang J. Mommsen, director of the German Historical Institute in London, used Ranke's ideas to justify the authoritarian policies of Bismarck. And, most recently in West Germany, Professor Mommsen said, ''Ranke and neo-Rankeans are becoming modish once again, and there are neo-neo-Rankeans.'' One sign of this revival is a new interest in such matters as foreign policy, the balance of power and the importance of the state. And What of China?  Prof. Zhang Zhilian of the University of Peking, regarded as China's leading specialist in European history, stood up in the audience toward the end of one session and asked, ''How much of Chinese history is included in Ranke's 'Universal History'?'' Was Ranke -who wrote that the East lay in a ''state of nature'' and ''eternal repose,'' and that the Chinese ''have chronology but no real history'' - merely a great Eurocentric? Professor Zhang said he could forgive an ignorance of the Chinese language and of Chinese historiography, but he agreed with Mr. Burke that the ''scientific'' Ranke seemed archaic compared with his ''philosophic'' predecessor, Voltaire, who took China quite seriously.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Professor Zhang's comment was followed by laughter and applause from the audience of about 100 scholars. Even here, the venerable Ranke was something less than a sacred cow.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    It was clear, though, that Ranke cut a figure of some bulk on the intellectual horizon of the past two centuries.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He represented one major strain - a relatively scientific strain - of 19th century thought; yet he also reserved for his distinctive historical world of scholarship large portions of art and sympathy, and the study of history has remained closer to the humanities than to the social sciences. An Impossible Modern Dream        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Ranke, who insisted that he saw God's work in the spirit and details of every historical period and even each historic event, may have inspired an impossible modern dream of factual objectivity in our own very different age, when the archives themselves have become a standard of truth. Mere loyalty to document has sometimes seemed a stifling, dusty standard, and it has not prevented the rise of more comprehensive and troublesome theories of history, including nationalistic, racial, Marxist, Freudian, anthropological, zoological and other theories. Yet, according to John Barker, a historian from Trent University in Canada, ''The question of what actually happened remains as relevant now as it was in Ranke's day.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Even more practically, the conference's organizer, Prof. James M. Powell of the University of Syracuse, argued that the intelligent discussion of politics owed so much to the study of history that Ranke might be said to have created a language of political discourse for modern democratic societies.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The University of Syracuse eyed Ranke's gigantic private library for a full decade before the historian died. It was finally purchased from his estate in 1887 for $25,000. Ranke's family had always assumed that the Prussian Government would buy the great scholar's books; but Prussia's attention was distracted in the late 1880's by the possibility of a European war, and it failed to act.        </p>

''If your strength had only held out last night,'' the mummy-like Ranke told poor Wiedemann, ''we could have finished our work; it's spread out before me in panorama; but it is too late; I am weary.'' And the great Ranke soon died, taking his panorama with him into what he once imagined would be the great archives of heaven.   This happened in 1886, and because of the roundness of that anniversary -and also because Ranke's private library of more than 20,000 volumes ended up at Syracuse University - an international conference of scholars gathered here recently to talk about Ranke's place in the history of history."></div>
