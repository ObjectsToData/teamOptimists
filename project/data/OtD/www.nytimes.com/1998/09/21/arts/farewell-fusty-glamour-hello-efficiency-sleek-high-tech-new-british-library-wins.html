''We are starting from scratch.''    What Miss Fletcher and others who hold the sought-after reader's passes to the new library's reading rooms have been pondering since their surprisingly emotional move across town is this: how do you weigh history against efficiency? What is better, fading glamour (and the ghosts of Karl Marx and Virginia Woolf) or modernistic beauty and a fighting chance of getting the book you need in an hour, instead of three days?   ">

''We are starting from scratch.''</p><p>What Miss Fletcher and others who hold the sought-after reader's passes to the new library's reading rooms have been pondering since their surprisingly emotional move across town is this: how do you weigh history against efficiency? What is better, fading glamour (and the ghosts of Karl Marx and Virginia Woolf) or modernistic beauty and a fighting chance of getting the book you need in an hour, instead of three days?</p><p>''Tradition and history might be helpful,'' said Andrew Wyllie, who uses the library to study gender in postwar British theater. ''But to have the space to work and easy access to the papers and books you need is infinitely better.''</p><p>Mr. Wyllie (pronounced WHY-lee) was full of trepidation about the move, which has been taking place in stages since last fall. He loved the atmosphere at the old library, which occupied a number of rooms in the British Museum. He loved the majestic dome in the Round Reading Room, where he did most of his research and where Dickens, Thackeray and George Bernard Shaw did much of their research, too.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I thought it was a great shame to abandon a purpose-built library like the one in Bloomsbury,'' he said the other day as he left the Humanities Reading Room, the replacement for the old Round Reading Room, in the new library. ''This could have turned into a disaster. But it's infinitely better. It's light. It's comfortable. It's cool. And most importantly, it takes an average of an hour between ordering and getting a book.''</p><p>Mr. Wyllie and the library's thousands of other readers were understandably worried about the new building, which during the 36 years and $843 million from conception to completion often seemed on its way to becoming one of the biggest white elephants London had ever seen.</p><p>The library had been buffeted over the years by changing public tastes, cost overruns, horrendous delays and a cacophony of complaints, including Prince Charles's sneering dismissal several years ago when he asked: ''How can you tell it is a library? It has no character to suggest it is a great public building.'' But the project has undergone an almost complete reversal of fortune in the last couple of years, and it opened to glorious reviews. (Parts of the library opened last fall, others in the spring; the official opening was in the summer.)</p><p>''The library is, quite simply, awesome; a great public building that graces its surroundings, provides us with a unique resource and even offers a new rendezvous for lovers in London,'' wrote the usually skeptical author Will Self in The Times of London in May. He said it made him feel young again. ''Trust me -- say to her/him: 'Meet me at the British Library in King's Cross.' And everything will go swimmingly.''</p><p>Mostly Praise, For the Interior</p><p>Visitors have embraced the much-maligned architecture, although the consensus still seems to be that the red-brick exterior fails to do justice to the building's glorious interior. ''There's no real denying that the outside of the building looks like a Tesco,'' said the writer Alain de Botton, referring to one of Britain's largest supermarket chains.</p><p>Still, the architect, Colin St. John Wilson, feels more than vindicated by the positive response. Prince Charles took a private tour of the library and was very encouraging (although he failed to publicly air his compliments, an omission that most likely irritated Mr. Wilson, who attributed his decision last year to close his design company to the public criticism he had endured over the library).</p><p>''I think the building is beginning to speak for itself,'' said Mr. Wilson, caught by chance the other day as he took some friends on a tour of his building. ''I never had a doubt, but all the same, it was a bit like someone coming and spitting in your face. What has been most gratifying is the way people come up to me and say they loved the old library and dreaded coming here, and now this is better.</p><p>''My sense of history tells me that the British always do this to architects,'' he said. ''Wren was put on half pay and sacked before he finished St. Paul's,'' he said, speaking of Sir Christopher Wren. ''And that also took 36 years.''</p><p>Nearly everyone has been impressed by the imagination and attention to detail within the building. ''It's a wonderful space, devoted entirely to a library,'' said the author Lady Antonia Fraser. ''I think if a library works as a library, that's the important thing. You don't necessarily have to sit there thinking, 'I'm part of a great tradition.' You would do better to think about your own work.''</p><p>One quality that the new library has in spades is space. The public spaces are enormous, rising up over several levels with surprising turns and features on each one. Of the four reading rooms (divided into 11 discrete ''reading areas''), the most spectacular is the Humanities Reading Room, built on three levels and lighted, as much of the rest of the building is, by daylight filtered through the ceiling.</p>                </div>
