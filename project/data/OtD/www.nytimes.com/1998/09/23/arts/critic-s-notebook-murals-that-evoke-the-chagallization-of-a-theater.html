    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Among the major works of 20th-century art, none have traveled more widely in the 1990's than the panoramic murals that were painted by Marc Chagall in January 1920 for the new Jewish Theater in Moscow. Like that theater  itself, and like many of those who had worked for it, they had been proscribed, suppressed and quite possibly destroyed in the Soviet Union. If Stalin could order the murder of Salomon Mikhoels, the Jewish Theater's greatest actor, what hope was there for the paintings?    The decorations -- the largest of which was about 13 feet high and 39 feet wide -- had, in fact, been taken away, rolled on big drums and kept in a secret place at the Tretyakov Museum in Moscow. In 1973, Chagall  went back to Russia after years of absence and was allowed to see them under supervision. In 1985, when the policies of glasnost prevailed, work began on their restoration.   ">

                    <p>Among the major works of 20th-century art, none have traveled more widely in the 1990's than the panoramic murals that were painted by Marc Chagall in January 1920 for the new Jewish Theater in Moscow. Like that theater  itself, and like many of those who had worked for it, they had been proscribed, suppressed and quite possibly destroyed in the Soviet Union. If Stalin could order the murder of Salomon Mikhoels, the Jewish Theater's greatest actor, what hope was there for the paintings?</p><p>The decorations -- the largest of which was about 13 feet high and 39 feet wide -- had, in fact, been taken away, rolled on big drums and kept in a secret place at the Tretyakov Museum in Moscow. In 1973, Chagall  went back to Russia after years of absence and was allowed to see them under supervision. In 1985, when the policies of glasnost prevailed, work began on their restoration.</p><p>Since 1991, the murals have been shown at the Gianadda Foundation in Martigny, Switzerland (which had helped substantially toward their restoration); at the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt, the Guggenheim Museum downtown in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.</p><p>Invariably, the effect they made was of irresistible jubilation, not unmixed with mischief. This was in large part because of the enormous painting called ''Introduction to the Jewish Theater,'' which is both an encyclopedia of traditional Yiddish motifs and a fast-forward autobiography by Chagall himself. (Scholars have disentangled no fewer than 54 separate motifs in its wonderfully fanciful and yet always incisive intimations.)</p>                </div>

                    <p>The murals also include four tall, commanding panels titled ''Drama,'' ''Music,'' ''Dance'' and ''Literature''; an immensely long and narrow frieze called ''The Wedding Feast'' and a large square painting, ''Love on the Stage.'' At once a delight for the eye and an education in the humanities, they were completed by Chagall in a remarkably short time.</p><p>There was much to celebrate when those murals were first seen in Moscow in 1920. In 1883 the Czar had imposed a total ban upon the Yiddish-language theater, which, thereafter, led at best a clandestine life. There appeared to be more promising  times in 1919, when the new regime took cognizance of the fact that 97 percent of Russia's Jewish population spoke Yiddish and should no longer be subjected to deprival.</p><p>Yet it may be that only now, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where the murals are on view until Oct. 4 in the exhibition ''Chagall: Love and the Stage,'' do visitors experience their original impact. To achieve this, the viewers need to feel that they are in an enclosed and quite small space.</p><p>At the Royal Academy that need is met. In the unornamented upstairs spaces of the academy's Sackler Gallery, there is no distraction. Plain ideas about installation are worked out on plain white walls. There is plenty of auxiliary material, and much of it is very telling, but it never strays from the point. Even those visitors who long ago gave up on later Chagall smile in bemusement.</p><p>Nearby, but separately, are drawings and sketches that show with what an instantaneous fidelity Chagall could note down whatever would suit him for future work. A prime instance of this is ''The Jewish Wedding,'' a drawing done with gouache and India ink, pen and brush, mounted on cardboard, on loan from a private collection in St. Petersburg, Russia. For energy, vivacity and sharp observation it would be hard to beat.</p><p>Chagall said in his memoirs: ''This was to be a real Yiddish theater, a temple of joyous creation, where prayers are chanted in the Yiddish language. We were building a world theater in which only the language separated us from other theaters. How would it be? What gods should we worship? We could not yet answer these questions. We didn't yet know our goals. To search for them was our main object.''</p><p>The theater in question had a tiny auditorium, with no more than 90 seats; it was originally part of a large private house. Chagall was determined that in this theater painting should take precedence. The theater should be a picture gallery as much as an auditorium, and the audience should have had an all-enveloping theatrical experience before the play had even begun. Chagall himself was to be preacher and poet, storyteller and dramatist. The theatergoers could watch the actors, if they liked. But he, Chagall, was ready to occupy their whole attention.</p><p>During the four weeks it took him to complete his work, he allowed no one else to enter the theater. Food was passed to him through a crack in the door. If anyone spoke to him of rehearsals onstage, he groaned. (''If only we didn't have to have people around,'' he said.) When he saw how members of the audience might have to back into the walls to let others pass, he feared that some damage might occur to his paintings.</p><p>Above all, he wanted every one of the actors to be ''Chagallized.'' They were to leave the ''real'' world at the stage door. There was to be nothing of the naturalistic theater that Stanislavsky and the Moscow Art Theater had brought to perfection. To help his actors avoid that, Chagall wanted them, in effect, to merge with his murals.</p><p>To that end, he covered every inch of their costumes with paint. He would fall upon them almost at curtain time, with brushes and palette in hand. Frock coats and peaked caps were transformed at breakneck speed. Tiny houses with tiny gardens appeared on their trousers. Birds and little pigs appeared on their hats.  Anything that smacked of realism  was outlawed, and even their faces were not exempt from transformation just before (or after) curtain time.</p><p>Even Salomon Mikhoels, whom Chagall worshiped as an actor, could not escape. Chagall would hold him back even when he was late on cue and the audience was calling out for him. ''If only I could tear out your right eye, what a wonderful mask I could make for you,'' the artist once said to the actor.</p><p>When the murals were first seen,  they did their work almost too well. The audience was so fascinated by them that it refused to let the play begin until someone came onstage and explained what the murals were about. But before long, the love affair between Chagall and the Jewish Theater curdled, and Aleksei Granovsky, the theater's director, decided that there must be limits to ''Chagallization.'' Chagall had taken over the auditorium, but he simply could not  be allowed to take over the stage.</p><p>In the words of Chagall's friend and champion, Amos Efron: ''We had to fight for our right to perform theater over Chagall's dead body, almost. Everything that we did to try and make theater upset him. He even accused the stagehands of deliberately scratching the scenery that he had painted himself.''</p><p>Chagall was bound to look for a larger audience for his murals, and in February 1921 he wrote to the management of the Jewish Theater:  ''I can find no inner peace until the 'masses' can see my work. At present it can be seen, at best, by one hundred Jews at close quarters.''</p><p>He added, ''I like the Jews very much, and have proved it many times over, but I also like the Russians, and people of many other nationalities, and I have been used to painting serious things for all of them.'' He therefore asked the theater to show his murals for two hours a day during which anyone who wished could see them.</p><p>In the end, Marc Chagall has had his way. His murals are welcome the world over, and nowhere more so than in the limpid spaces of the Sackler Gallery at the Royal Academy of Arts in London at this moment.</p><p>Photo: A work from the show ''Chagall: Love and the Stage,'' in London.
