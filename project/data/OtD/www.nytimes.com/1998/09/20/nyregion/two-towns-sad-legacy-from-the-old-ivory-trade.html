Today that industry would provoke screams of rage from human rights and animal rights activists for the dead bodies, thousands upon thousands of them, human and animal, that the industry left in its wake.     The towns are Deep River and Essex and the industry was ivory, the importing of elephant tusks from Africa and the cutting of them into combs and knife handles and ornaments but particularly into piano keys at a time in America when every family had a piano, or wanted one.

                    <p>IN the last half of the 19th century and the first half of this century, two towns near the mouth of the Connecticut River were famed for an industry that brought them great prosperity. Today that industry would provoke screams of rage from human rights and animal rights activists for the dead bodies, thousands upon thousands of them, human and animal, that the industry left in its wake.</p><p>The towns are Deep River and Essex and the industry was ivory, the importing of elephant tusks from Africa and the cutting of them into combs and knife handles and ornaments but particularly into piano keys at a time in America when every family had a piano, or wanted one.</p><p>In both communities, the sight of elephant tusks being hauled off the decks of steamships at river landings, or being transported to factories in horse-drawn wagons, was once so commonplace that no one turned a head.</p><p>The two companies that shaped the towns for generation after generation were Pratt, Read &amp; Company in Deep River and Comstock, Cheney &amp; Company in Essex. Now they are memories, but their buildings remain -- Pratt, Read's now a condominium complex known, appropriately, as The Piano Works and Comstock, Cheney's now mostly occupied by other businesses. Starting on next Sunday, half a century after the ivory business finally collapsed with the advent of plastics, the two river towns will jointly offer a series of free programs and exhibits on the ivory trade. Entitled ''The Towns That Elephants Built,'' the series is the brainchild of Robbi Storms, librarian in the Ivoryton section of Essex. A couple of years ago, Mrs. Storms says, she opened a letter from the Connecticut Humanities Council advising that grant money was available. A former high school English teacher, she had never written a grant proposal but did have an idea, and the grant was won.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Her idea was to explain the economic and social impact of ivory on Essex and Deep River as Pratt, Read and Comstock, Cheney became so economically powerful that at the turn of this century they dominated the ivory trade between Africa and America. And, of course, they also dominated their towns simply by being the major employers. People in Deep River worked for Pratt, Read. People in Essex, particularly those in Ivoryton, worked for Comstock, Cheney.</p><p>Ivoryton was, and because so much of it remains intact, still is, a model of a company town. Virtually everything of importance was connected to Comstock, Cheney.</p><p>The Ivoryton Library was put up by Comstock, Cheney for its workers. The company also built the Ivoryton Playhouse, diagonally across Main Street from the library, as a place where the workers could go for meetings and entertainment. It provided a company store and an Episcopal church, All Saints. It constructed a dormitory for unmarried male workers, houses for married workers and bigger homes for its executives, all within walking  distance of work. The old dormitory, which eventually became the Ivoryton Inn, is now shuttered but still standing, as are the homes built for the factory workers and now owned privately. The playhouse is enjoying an extended life as a summer theater.</p><p>The library, now supported by the town, is a structure of wooden walls and high ceilings, so ornately Victorian that a visitor almost expects the librarian to wear a hoop skirt. The only major alteration to the building from the 1890's, when it was new, is a central heating system, a modern-day substitution for the building's seven fireplaces.</p><p>But despite all the reminders of the earlier, and fascinating, age all about them, Mrs. Storms says, many people in Ivoryton today, even some who live in former factory-built homes, know little about the history of the area and the ivory trade.</p><p>''I want people to know the history of this library and the town, and ivory,'' she says. ''Ivoryton has a new population of people who live in big houses on big lots going up all around us and they know nothing about the history here.''</p><p>She realizes that the history includes a somber downside in Africa, where the number of animals slaughtered and the number of enslaved Africans who died in the hunt for ivory is a  horror story. But it is part of the overall story that should also be told, she feels. And that is where Richard Conniff comes in.</p><p>Mr. Conniff, recruited by Mrs. Storms for her project, is a writer whose work appears in National Geographic Magazine and other publications and who lives in Old Lyme. He is also, sort of by happenstance, very well versed in the ivory trade.</p><p>In the mid 1980's, Mr. Conniff was living in an old ship captain's house in Deep River and stumbled upon a facet of the town that particularly interested him. It was the link to the African ivory trade and he started to investigate it.</p><p>The result was a long article in Audubon Magazine in 1987, entitled ''When the Music in Our Parlors Brought Death to Darkest Africa.''</p><p>The article detailed the start of the ivory industry along the Connecticut River in 1798 when a Yankee artisan named Phineas Pratt invented a saw, using wind or water power, to cut ivory.</p>                </div>
