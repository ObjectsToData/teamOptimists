                    <p>''I'm primarily thinking of the D.O.D. in terms of its significance,'' he said, and added that Federal financing for the arts was vital to the country's ''internal defense.''</p><p>On the day after last month's House vote, which the arts world hailed as a major turning point, Mr. Ivey met with old and new friends of the arts in Congress and sorted through congratulatory messages, including one from his predecessor, the New York actress Jane Alexander, who spent most of her five-year tenure at the agency in survival mode. Later in the day he gave a little reception in his office for a giddy bunch of arts lobbyists talking about the ''new environment.'' And when he told them to celebrate by grabbing some extra cookies on their way out, most did.</p><p>''We don't usually serve them cookies, but they deserve it,'' said the N.E.A.'s longtime spokeswoman, Cherie Simon, a veteran of battles that seem to have left her half-afraid that some critic might mount an objection to the endowment's runaway brownie budget.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, even some of the conservatives who tried hardest to kill the arts agency now seem at least open to Mr. Ivey. The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, recently praised the new chairman's ties to country music, saying, ''That's got to make him a good man, doesn't it?'' Another Republican, Senator Jesse Helms, wished Mr. Ivey every success after a meeting in which they chatted about the country singer Randy Travis, who is from North Carolina, Mr. Helms's home state.</p><p>Mr. Ivey, 53, is not a native Southerner, having grown up in a small town in Michigan. But he is not a New Yorker, either, and that seems to be a selling point to those critics who have seen the agency mostly as a source of financing for East Village graffiti artists, despite the N.E.A.'s considerable efforts to play up its grants to Midwestern basket weavers and regional theater.</p><p>''Of course it helped that he's from somewhere else,'' Ms. Alexander said in a telephone interview.</p><p>As John Brademas, chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, put it, ''He's thoughtful, intelligent, sophisticated,'' and, with his Middle American pedigree and country music background, ''no one can charge him with being a wild man.''</p><p>It has been three years since Republican partisans of the Gingrich revolution, in a rage over several late-1980's N.E.A. grants that supported such controversial works as a photograph of a crucifix in a container of urine, vowed to end Federal financing for the arts. A number of factors appear to have influenced the recent turnaround, among them a Supreme Court decision in June that upheld Congressionally imposed decency standards for the endowment.</p><p>In addition, many conservatives had already been mollified by a 40 percent cut in financing for the agency two years ago. And several lawmakers say the personal pull of Representative Sidney R. Yates, an Illinois Democrat and longtime arts advocate who is retiring after this year, was a consideration. Many of his colleagues did not want his career to end on such a down note.</p><p>Another force at work was the moderating effect of the coming Congressional elections and the lobbying of constituencies back home. Grass-roots supporters of the endowment, who had become less inclined to fight among themselves while it was under attack, pressured their representatives in Congress, often with the backing of Republican business leaders who serve on the boards of arts institutions.</p><p>Last fall, as promised, the House voted no money for the endowment in this fiscal year. But the Senate decided on $98 million for it. When the moderates prevailed in a conference committee and pushed the Senate version through, much of the credit went to lobbyists back home, especially in Washington State, where a group of Boeing executives had been able to convert Senator Slade Gorton, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the agency.</p><p>After that, Ms. Alexander said, ''We pretty much knew we were home free.''</p><p>In this summer's battle for financing, Mr. Ivey is credited with closing the deal for a number of last-minute converts in the House by putting Republicans at ease, particularly with his support for the recent Supreme Court decision. Still, the margin of victory when the House voted by 253 to 173 last month to retain the current level of financing next year stunned even the N.E.A.'s most optimistic supporters. The Senate will now vote, and the agency expects a modest increase in the final bill.</p><p>In September, as part of its effort to mend fences with Congress by making sure grants go to all 50 states, the endowment will announce the first round of grants to states that have received the fewest in the past. Other big projects in the works are a preservation program for outdoor sculpture and a program that will take composers to communities across the country, where they will live for a time and write music inspired by the area: ''a very cool project,'' Mr. Ivey promised.</p><p>Meanwhile, it is impossible not to notice that Mr. Ivey is having fun in a job that could never have been described that way when Ms. Alexander held it. (''I'm peachy!'' he sang when asked how he was while shaking hands with a reporter.) He says his success is a tribute to what can happen when a person pursues a passion without worrying too much about pursuing any certain job. After growing up on the jazz that his father, a trumpet player, and his mother, a pianist, courted to in the 1930's, he fell in love with the folk music of the Kingston Trio in high school. He took up the guitar, then studied folklore in college and ethnomusicology in graduate school before joining the Country Music Foundation.</p><p>''Country was kind of unfashionable in intellectual circles and seen as a hayseed art form,'' said Bruce Dobie, a friend of Mr. Ivey's who is the editor of The Nashville Scene, an alternative newspaper. ''Bill was able to communicate its importance to the media, academics and people whose art form might be considered a little more adventuresome or modern.'' Now he wants to do the same for the often-reviled endowment.</p><p>When the call about the chairmanship came from the Clinton Administration this spring, Mr. Ivey sold his Nashville home in 72 hours and assumed the post without even token opposition: Senate confirmation hearings were deemed unnecessary.</p><p>''A little part of me was disappointed that I didn't get to sit there and tell my story,'' he said. ''But everyone I tell that says, 'Oh, it's better without a hearing.' ''</p><p>Photo: Just two months after William J. Ivey took over as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, there is talk of a ''new environment.''
