    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="VIRGINIA VALIAN, a professor of psychology and linguistics at Hunter College in New York, normally studies how  children learn language, but years ago she came across an academic monograph that practically left her speechless. The report demonstrated how the same professional credentials are evaluated differently depending on whether they are possessed by a man or a woman -- with the woman being the loser.    Since then, Dr. Valian has analyzed many hundreds of studies on the status of women in the professions, science and academia. She has now pulled the vast and ragged literature together into a compelling book called ''Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women,'' published by the M.I.T. Press. On a recent summer afternoon, as construction workers clattered and hammered outside her office door, Dr. Valian, a sturdy, dynamic woman with thick white hair and thick dark eyebrows, talked about women's professional progress, and what might help pick up the pace.">

The report demonstrated how the same professional credentials are evaluated differently depending on whether they are possessed by a man or a woman -- with the woman being the loser.</p><p>Since then, Dr. Valian has analyzed many hundreds of studies on the status of women in the professions, science and academia. She has now pulled the vast and ragged literature together into a compelling book called ''Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women,'' published by the M.I.T. Press. On a recent summer afternoon, as construction workers clattered and hammered outside her office door, Dr. Valian, a sturdy, dynamic woman with thick white hair and thick dark eyebrows, talked about women's professional progress, and what might help pick up the pace.</p><p>Q. Your book is about the progress of women in academia, in science and other professions, and its very title, ''Why So Slow?'' starts with the assumption that women are not getting ahead at the rate they should. Are women really going so slowly? What is the evidence?</p><p>A. The cleanest and most thorough data we have on the course of women's careers is for women in academia, but a similar pattern holds for lawyers and business people. Several agencies have tracked the progress of male and female Ph.D.'s in the sciences and the humanities and looked at how they fare on the professorial track. What seems to happen is that men and women start out on roughly equal footing. They get almost the same salaries, and they begin at the same rank, assistant professor. But if you look several years down the line, the differences in their career paths become apparent. The men are earning more, and they are being promoted at a faster rate than the women are. There's one very good study in which researchers looked at a subset of Ph.D. scientists who had won prestigious postdoctoral fellowships. Their question: In this group of people with outstanding early promise, will the men and women advance equally in academia? Even here, the answer was no. After 10 to 12 years, the men were almost a full rank ahead of the women.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Q. Why are the men pulling ahead?</p><p>A. One factor that people often raise in explaining the discrepancy is, men in academia publish more than women do, and publications, as we all know, are essential to academic success. Yet there are two points to be made about publication rates. First, even when you control for productivity, men still advance more rapidly than women do. Second, although men publish comparatively more papers, women's papers have a higher citation rate -- that is, they're referred to more often by other scientists. So women publish less, but if you take citation rate as a measure of quality, women publish better work. Unfortunately, university boards don't often explicitly consider publication quality when making decisions on promotion and tenure.</p><p>Q. Why do women emphasize quality over quantity in publishing?</p><p>A. Women may fear or suspect that their work will not be evaluated in same way a man's is, so they need more documentation to back up what they are saying. Men may be more willing to take a flier, to come up with some intriguing hypothesis for which they have relatively meager data and just put it out there to be proven true or false. Women may believe, perhaps correctly, that they are less likely to be given the benefit of the doubt, and that their off-the-cuff ideas will be dismissed as foolish. We associate risk-taking behavior with men, and we may be less tolerant of intellectual risk-taking in women.</p><p>Q. A core thesis of your book is that we all have ideas of how men and women generally behave, and that these gender schemas can work against women's professional advancement. Why not just call these schemas stereotypes?</p><p>A. I prefer the term schema to stereotype because stereotype has such negative connotations, as though we shouldn't have these things in the first place. But we can't get along in the world without some conceptual framework, some generalizations about social groups and events. We need a way to predict what will happen, and to know how to behave appropriately in various situations. If you're a college student, you need a schema of what a professor is. A professor is supposed to show up for every class, be there on time, stay the whole period, be competent in the material, grade people fairly, and so forth. A student knows that you don't bribe your professor, that's not how things work.</p><p>When we get to male and female schemas, well, then, we're all self-styled experts. You can take a person at random and list a bunch of adjectives -- ''assertive,'' ''has high leadership ability,'' ''is kind to children'' -- and the person would have no trouble matching them up with one sex or the other.</p><p>Q. If gender schemas are not necessarily bad, how do they hurt women?</p>                </div>
