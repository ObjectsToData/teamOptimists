                    <p>OVERLOOKING a picturesque riverbank in Rhode Island sits a modest two-story clapboard building with high, narrow windows. Like many houses and shops in Warren, which was a whaling town when many of its oldest maples and birch trees were not yet pollen on the wind, this former general store exudes a palpable sense of an era when time seemed more likely to take its time.</p><p>Much of that same sense is evoked by the best-selling illustrator and author, David A. Macaulay, who for the last 10 years has toiled in this place he calls his studio. Mr. Macaulay, best known for a series of books and CD-ROM's that reveal, with whimsy and wit, how common technologies work, is not wedded to late-20th-century gadgetry and know-how.</p><p>Mr. Macaulay uses pen and ink to create his signature illustrations in books like ''The Way Things Work: From Levers to Lasers, Cars to Computers -- a Visual Guide to the World of Machines'' and ''Underground'' (both published by Houghton Mifflin). They reveal, in often startling clarity, the inner workings of everything from a computer's mouse to subway systems (sans the mice). But Mr. Macaulay does not consider himself a high-tech guy.</p><p>Instead, he said, he sees himself as a perpetual student in love with learning how things -- whether gears, pistons or microprocessors -- are designed and work. Once he understands their mysteries, Mr. Macaulay said, he becomes the impassioned teacher, rendering the seemingly complex accessible.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A large part of making technologies seem less threatening is understanding how they work and how they came to be, said Mr. Macaulay, who was born in Britain but has lived in the United States since he was 11.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr. Macaulay, who is 51, is very selective about the technologies he embraces. He favors telephones and fax machines over E-mail, and he trusts his $25 Lamy fountain pens more than expensive computer graphics programs like  Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Trained as an architect at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he occasionally teaches, Mr. Macaulay said he could not imagine living in a modern house. ''I find it reassuring to be connected, to feel connected, to sort of a continuum of time,'' he said, and for him, that means living in a house where the trees have grown up around it.</p><p>Mr. Macaulay lives in a handsome old house behind his studio with his third wife, Ruthie; his daughter Charlotte, 16, and the couple's 8-month-old, Julia Hope. His 23-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, a graduate student, is away at Boston College.</p><p>Mr. Macaulay said that by May, he would be moving with his family into a 150-year-old house he has longed for in neighboring Bristol, R.I. He is also moving to a rented studio where sails were once made near the new home.</p><p>Even though he was in the middle of moving, he was wrestling with the deadline for the long-awaited revision of ''The Way Things Work.''</p><p>For weeks, Mr. Macaulay has been at the new house, tearing out its walls and gutting its kitchen and bathrooms with a sledgehammer and his gloved hands. ''I like the physical work,'' he said.</p><p>''I work in the world of low tech, but it helps me to understand the world of high tech,'' he said in a recent interview in his studio, site of  a cheery clutter of art and reference books, toys, art objects, collectibles (like toy soldiers), a pet rabbit and even a real human skeleton. He said he enjoyed peeling back the skin of the Bristol house and looking into its secrets, its soul.</p><p>It is his fascination for what lies beneath the surface of things, Mr. Macaulay said, that makes his work entertaining and engaging.</p><p>''I think what David has been able to do through his illustrations and stories is to take what historically has been boring to most young people and convert it to something easy to read and easy to understand,'' said John Ray Hoke Jr., a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.</p><p>An American Institute of Architects medal hangs in Mr. Macaulay's studio along with a National Endowment for the Humanities prize he received last year at the White House.</p><p>An electronic postal scale, its innards laid bare for illustrations scheduled for the revision, was in pieces on a table.</p><p>''I'm not afraid to attack any subject or any level of technology,'' Mr. Macaulay said.</p><p>''Being an explainer is really a nice job,'' he said as he looked over a series of drawings for the revision. ''You get to be a student forever.''</p><p>MR. MACAULAY is also preparing to work on a five-part television series on engineering that will take him to the sites of some of humankind's greatest engineering feats, ancient and modern. And Dorling Kindersley, the British publishers of his popular CD-ROM's, is creating a CD-ROM inspired by his quirky take on technology; Mr. Macaulay is a consultant on the project. The CD-ROM is a learning game in which users must demonstrate their understanding of the parts and principles of a virtual pinball machine before it can be played.</p><p>All of his projects keep Mr. Macaulay busy and under pressure. But  while he works on his house, rides his bicycle, plays with his baby daughter  and even sleeps, he said, the wheels of his mind are ''still grinding.'' He explained: ''If I had X amount of time, I would take 90 to 95 percent of it to just think. You can call it procrastination, but in fact, it's not.''</p><p>Mr. Macaulay's work habits apparently work, said Jim Gomes, 36, a stonemason in nearby Scituate, R.I.</p><p>''I'm just fascinated in how this man knows what he knows,'' said Mr. Gomes, who recently stopped by Mr. Macaulay's studio to meet him.</p><p>Mr. Gomes said he had been especially impressed by Mr. Macaulay's first book, ''Cathedral,'' published in 1973. ''It was just absolutely amazing how they did things,'' Mr. Gomes said of the stonemasonry methods he learned about in the book. It inspired him to continue building miniature masonry art pieces, he said.</p><p>After a cordial visit with Mr. Macaulay, Mr. Gomes held up a miniature fireplace he had in his truck as the illustrator drove off to lunch.</p><p>''The whole thing,'' Mr. Macaulay said as he drove away, summing up his mission, ''is to get people to enter that world of technology with a smile, or at least a slight smirk.''</p><p>Photos: Even though he explains technologies in ''The Way Things Work,'' also in CD-ROM, above, David A. Macaulay draws with pen and ink. (Evan Richman for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
