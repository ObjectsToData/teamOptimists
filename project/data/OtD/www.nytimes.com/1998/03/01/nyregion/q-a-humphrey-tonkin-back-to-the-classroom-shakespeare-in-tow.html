Academic programs also have broadened, and a $5 million deficit, due largely to the recession of the early 1990's, has all but disappeared.</p><p>During an interview in his office, Mr. Tonkin, who is also chairman of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, spoke of the role of higher education in society, the changing role of the teacher and technology in the classroom, and the constant popularity of Shakespeare. Following are excerpts from that conversation.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Q. The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges has lobbyists at the General Assembly. What relationship do private colleges have with the state?</p><p>A. Higher education is a public good. Students should have opportunities to attend any of the various institutions in the state -- be they public, be they independent.</p><p>And from the point of view of the taxpayer, independent higher education is an extremely good bargain. We give, for example, almost half of the four-year degrees that are given in the state. We give two-thirds of the graduate degrees. So we are a very big factor in the economy.</p><p>The reality is that if you simply subsidize a piece of the system, you may in fact not improve the system overall; you may simply move students from one place to another.</p><p>So what you really have to do is look comprehensively at the whole system, provide it with the kind of support that allows it to function well, and if you do that effectively then we'll end up keeping more of our students in Connecticut so that they don't wander off to other places, and also attracting good students into the state, who can then occupy some of those jobs for which industry has so much demand.</p><p>Q. What direction do you see higher education heading in general, and in the state?</p><p>A. I think we have a highly unstable economy in higher education.  Independent institutions are getting more and more expensive for the people who attend them. And public institutions are absorbing more and more public money. We may have overextended ourselves in the provisions of resources to higher education generally.</p><p>Independent higher education could easily price itself out of the market, and public higher education could easily become so expensive that the states can't afford it.</p><p>We need to come up with something more rational. If you look at the state, specifically, if we spend money on the public sector, and we don't look after the independent sector, the result will be a weakening of the independent sector without a parallel strengthening of the public sector. The one will, in effect, simply draw resources from the other. So we need to be looking at a comprehensive public policy approach to higher education generally.</p><p>Q. Is that happening?</p><p>A. Not to the extent that it needs to be.</p><p>Q. Why are leaving your post as president of the University of Hartford?</p><p>A. Well, I've been president at one place or another now for 15 years, over a third of my professional life, and I think you reach a certain age where you say to yourself, is what I'm doing now the only thing I've ever wanted to do? So I reached the conclusion that it probably made sense for me to turn myself back into a faculty member.</p><p>The other thing is, I think that being a college president is something that one should do for a piece of time but not do forever, because in some sense a part of the job description is that the president be overworked. Go like crazy, and push really, really hard, but in the process of doing that you get tired. Having done 15 years of college presidencies, it's about the outer limit of one person should be able to stand.</p><p>Q. What is it about the classroom that excites you?</p><p>A. There are two things really. One is the simple give and take. At the end of the day, you feel as though you've done something that will have a long-term effect on people of a positive kind. The second, actually, has to do with the particular point in history that we've reached. I've been assisting other people to make use of new technology. I want to use the new technology, to see what it will do for me and the teaching process.</p><p>So there's both the notion that you're actually dealing with one-on-one with somebody on whom who you can actually have a positive effect, and also the very simple fact that the 90's are a terrific and exciting time to be involved in teaching. I'm watching other people do it and I find myself saying, ''I want to get in there and do that too'.''</p><p>Q. Would you say that with new technology in the classroom, the teacher's role is changing?</p>                </div>
