    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="''I have a soft spot for Webb's car,'' Bill Ivey said as he peered wistfully over at the silver-dollar-studded 1962 Pontiac convertible with tooled leather seats, pistols for door handles, horseshoes for pedals, and huge steer horns mounted on the front bumper. It was owned by the honky-tonk singer Webb Pierce, and ''he was still driving it around when I first came to town,'' Mr. Ivey said.    It is probably safe to assume that Mr. Ivey, the director of the Country Music Foundation, who was nominated by President Clinton last month as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, would be the first person in the job quite so conversant with bits of Americana like Pierce's ''Webbmobile''; Elvis Presley's 1960 Cadillac, with its 40 coats of 24-karat gold paint, or the other artifacts on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum here. Mr. Ivey has run the museum since 1971.  ">

                    <p>''Bill Ivey's genius is that he has been able to speak a variety of different languages,'' said Bruce Feiler, author of ''Dreaming Out Loud: Garth Brooks, Wynonna Judd, Wade Hayes and the Changing Face of Nashville''. ''He speaks politics, he speaks money, he speaks art, and he speaks academics, and those are all skills he's going to need in Washington. He's a liberal-minded intellectual who has managed to thrive in a conservative culture, all of which makes him an ideal person to come to the N.E.A. today.''</p><p>It does not take much of a cynic to assume that there were both political and artistic considerations in the choice of Mr. Ivey to manage an agency long reviled by conservatives and accused of catering to artistic elitists.</p><p>''I'm sure that it set off alarms in some quarters to have the National Endowment for the Arts and the Country Music Foundation connected,'' he said.</p><p>But those who know him say that he is eminently qualified to run the agency and that if his populist cultural credentials help politically, so much the better.</p><p>''It's a savvy political choice, but no one should underestimate either Bill Ivey or the Country Music Foundation,'' said Jane Alexander, who resigned last year as the endowment's chairwoman, lamenting conservative assaults on the agency. ''But if it's political, well, why not? We're dealing with people who've used the N.E.A. as a political football, so why not make a political choice and end that game?''</p><p>Whether the game is likely to end is a big question. But few who know him doubt Mr. Ivey's ability to play it.</p><p>Mr. Ivey came to Nashville in 1971 out of graduate school at Indiana University, where he was pursuing a doctorate in ethnomusicology. He was hired to head the library at the Country Music Foundation and within a few months ended up as its director.</p><p>Unlike the Country Music Association, the trade organization promoting country music, the Country Music Foundation is a research and educational organization that has come to be viewed as an unmatched model for preserving, studying and celebrating a musical form. It now oversees a museum for which a new $35 million home is being built in downtown Nashville, a journal and a library and musical archive containing more than a million performances on everything from antique cylinders to CD's.</p><p>Marty Stuart, a popular country singer who is the current foundation president, said Mr. Ivey had spoken to the best parts of the country tradition, even trying unsuccessfully to extend the museum's reach to the rural blues of black artists like Muddy Waters. One of Mr. Ivey's recent projects is ''From Where I Stand: The Black Experience in Country Music,'' an ambitious three-CD project produced by the foundation and released by Warner Brothers Records.</p><p>''He's a guy with a very broad cultural view who has eloquently represented the artists and the best traditions of country music,'' Mr. Stuart said.</p><p>Mr. Ivey, 53, is no country music cliche. He drives a BMW rather than a pickup. His silver hair, blue oxford shirt and tan sweater vest give him an air that says academia more than Dew Drop Inn. He has been involved with national endowment panels for years and is enough of a national cultural insider that he was Hillary Rodham Clinton's escort last year when she was nominated for a Grammy for the spoken version of her book, ''It Takes a Village.''</p><p>In his office, he keeps the music videos of Country Music Television on with the sound off, turning up the volume if there is one he wants to hear. But at home he is more likely to listen to classic jazz by Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker or Charlie Parker than to Garth Brooks. A guitarist who has also taken up the piano, he is also partial to jazz and classical guitarists, singer-songwriters like John Hiatt, Guy Clark and Joe Ely or country acts with real connections to the music's roots like Alison Krauss or Alan Jackson.</p><p>What draws him to country is what draws him to other cultural experiences as well.</p>                </div>
