''X represents years, and y represents money.''</p><p>Mr. Harris, 18, a senior at the school, on the East Side of Manhattan, was trying to convince a committee of five that investing $5,000 in Nike and Xerox stocks and $5,000 in mutual funds would be a sound idea.</p><p>But for Mr. Harris, the stakes were higher than a mere $10,000. His high school diploma was on the line. As part of requirements for graduation, students at the School of the Future, as well as at 20 other small alternative public schools in New York City, must pass four such ''exhibitions'' in their last four years there. For an exhibition, students write and present a research paper in science and math and two in humanities.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Topics have ranged from the Vietnam War to Israel, slavery to racism, immigration to New York City tenements.</p><p>Kasia Kedzia, 18, a junior, presented her first humanities exhibition last year on The Relationship Between Love and Death in Poetry.  After months of analyzing sonnets, she concluded that the focus of her own poems was not broad enough.</p><p>''My poems had the same plot: You like this guy, and then it doesn't work out,'' Ms. Kedzia said. ''And then the you-are-miserable-at-the-end type of poem. The exhibition forced me not to be narrow. I can use symbolism now. I can write about grass, things that I never thought about before.''</p><p>The school, which has 525 students from grades 6 through 12, focuses on technology, with an emphasis on computer science. It models itself on the theories of Theodore Sizer, the school reformer and author who emphasizes an interdisciplinary curriculum and  small class sizes where students can actively engage in their own learning. Forty New York City schools are members of the Center for Collaborative Education, the local affiliate of Dr. Sizer's national Coalition of Essential Schools. At least half of the Collaborative Education schools require exhibitions from their high school students.</p><p>The schools currently operate under a five-year waiver that exempts them from administering the state's standardized tests. No graduates have received a Regents diploma, given to students who pass advanced state tests, but almost all have gone on to college, said Kathy Pelles, the principal of the School of the Future, whose third class is graduating this week.</p><p>While students at the School of the Future receive traditional grades for course work, the exhibitions provide another way to gauge  progress. They are evaluated by four categories: mastery with distinction, mastery, satisfactory and needs improvement.</p><p>For her presentation, Caryle Ann Francis, 17, analyzed why black male characters in Toni Morrison's ''Beloved'' and ''The Bluest Eye'' struggled with issues of intimacy. She had written five drafts -- now dogeared and stuffed into a folder decorated with an enlarged passport photo of herself as a tot. She had recited her paper three times in front of the mirror in the girls' restroom, and even tacked a huge sheet of paper with her outline on the wall she would be facing when presenting.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ms. Francis was given only a mastery. She plans to appeal for a higher evaluation. Although she is one of the school's top students, she may have had a harder time because she stocked her committee with literature teachers and students. Presenters can select their own panelists, as long as there are at least two teachers. Students tend to take the task seriously.</p><p>Jermaine Harris sat on the committee of his friend, Shangari Meleschi, in March, and Mr. Meleschi sat on his.</p><p>''I wasn't going to let him off easy,'' said Mr. Meleschi, who had also researched the stock market for his exhibition, as did Jermaine's twin brother, Tremaine. ''But I wasn't going to fail him, either. I know how hard he works.''</p><p>Jermaine's presentation, which lasted more than an hour, was full of graphs and statistics, and in his grilling he was asked to rethink a number of equations.</p><p>''Does x always represent years and y represent money?'' one teacher asked.</p><p>Mr. Harris coughed nervously.</p><p>The teacher rephrased the question: ''Is time dependent on money, or is money dependent on time?''</p><p>He looked for a hint in the teacher's face but couldn't find it, and though he had done well on other questions, in the end, he was awarded a mastery.</p><p>Photos: Tremaine Harris, who researched the workings of the stock market for his exhibition, argues his case before Shawn McLean, a fellow student, left; Nadine Laguardia, center, and Anne Brownstein, teachers.
