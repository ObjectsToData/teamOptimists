                    <p>''Interesting -- if true'' is a skeptical phrase that has imprinted itself permanently on my consciousness. A platoon of fact checkers might attest to the accuracy of individual statements, but what of facts that have been ''selected out,'' what of a writer's bias, or blindness, or determination to discover ''the figure in the carpet,'' as Leon Edel, the distinguished biographer of Henry James, recommended? That is, what of the hidden story of the subject's life, known only to the astute biographer?</p><p>No matter that the subject's life might not have conformed to a pattern or a story, the task is to find it. What biographer will admit that his subject lacks narrative shapeliness? Between an honest but dull book and a not entirely honest but lively one, how many biographers would hesitate?</p><p>In any case, language by its nature tends to distort experience. With the best of intentions, in recalling the past we are already altering -- one might say violating -- the original experience, even if it is just the previous night's dream, which may have been wordless and was certainly improvised.</p><p>Contemporary biographies and memoirs that purport to replicate conversations and nuances of behavior across decades are clearly fictional in technique, if not in essence. (Yet, thinks the skeptic, why not in essence, too? Can any true statement be composed of a succession of false syllables?)</p><p>Putative eyewitnesses in criminal cases are notoriously unreliable, yet juries are powerfully persuaded by their testimonies; people will adamantly swear to the truth of something that didn't in fact happen, and will refuse to change their minds even when their mistakes are pointed out to them.</p><p>It would be the rare memoirist who could transcend the limitations of our error-prone species and also resist the commercial lures of ''faction'' (fact plus fiction), the ''rounding of corners to make a better narrative'' (the euphemism John Berendt has used to describe his technique in his best-seller ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'').</p><p>Writing is an art, and art means artifice, the artificial. That we are keenly aware of this today testifies to our higher standard of truth no less than to our diminished expectation of encountering it. The contemporary predilection for ''nonfiction'' in the form of that most notional of all genres, ''memoir,'' testifies, perhaps, to our desperate wish that some truth of the spirit be presented to us, though we know it's probably invented. We want to believe! We are the species that clamors to be lied to.</p><p>The truth of one era becomes, as if by an artist's sleight of hand, the mythology of subsequent eras. What was sacred becomes secular. Our impassioned ancestors must have intended books like the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament to be historical documents, bearing the literal truth, not the metaphorical truth they embody today.</p><p>In Puritan New England, Cotton Mather's massive ''Magnalia Christi Americana'' (''The Great American Works of Christ'') was read as divinely inspired history, but can be read today only as an epic encyclopedia of early New England from the perspective of the most revered and intolerant of Puritan ministers.</p><p>It was a Puritan conviction that history was the biography of saints -- Puritan saints. And the earliest American memoirs are exclusively religious, confessions of faith offered as qualification for church membership. One would hardly expect any measure of objectivity from these documents, yet in their time they were presumably models of the newly evolving genre of ''life-writing.''</p><p>In theory, a diary or a journal may be a fairly accurate record of a person's life, but any memoir or autobiography that is artfully shaped, didactically intended, divided into sections and narrated with retrospective omniscience is a text, and therefore an artifact. It may contain elements of truth, but its very organization belies the messiness and myopia of real life.</p><p>Slave narratives tended to follow formal patterns of narration, often consisting of a ''before'' and ''after'' (the escape from slavery). So do tales of religious conversion or of a repudiation of a vice like alcoholism.</p><p>Such American classics as Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography,'' Henry David Thoreau's ''Walden'' and Henry Adams's ''Education'' seem highly calculated literary inventions in which ideas are principles of organization and much of ''real'' life is omitted. Thoreau's prose in particular was painstakingly rewritten, a mosaic of meticulously observed nature vignettes conjoined with an impassioned polemic. Both were imposed on a single year at Walden Pond -- although Thoreau lived in his cabin there for two years, and lived a historic life very different from the idealized, rather bodiless and monastic life he presents in his book.</p><p>Thoreau, who disapproved of fiction, preferring ''one world at a time,'' was as masterly a creator of his own mythic image as Mark Twain, Jack London, Ernest Hemingway would be of theirs in subsequent generations.</p><p>Yet who would wish ''Walden'' and other classics altered in the interest of factual ''truth''?</p><p>In ''Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol,'' the historian Nell Irvin Painter discusses the ''resistance'' she encountered when she presented a respectfully revisionist portrait of the ex-slave and abolitionist preacher who, along with Harriet Tubman, was one of the two most famous African-American women of the 19th century.</p><p>Far from welcoming Ms. Painter's discoveries, audiences who heard her speak were disgruntled; even fellow historians slighted her findings, preferring the earlier, ''mythic'' Truth to the complex, flawed and very human woman whom Ms. Painter movingly presents in her biography.</p><p>Yet, in the concluding chapter, Ms. Painter seems to reassess her subject and, by extension, the process of creating history itself. ''Sojourner Truth belongs to a company of 'invented Greats,' '' she writes. ''The symbol of Sojourner Truth is stronger and more essential in our culture than the complicated person.'' She adds, ''The symbol we require in our public life still triumphs over scholarship.''</p><p>Not all historians or readers will agree with Ms. Painter that ''symbol'' is more valuable than history or truth. But it's illuminating to see this intellectual problem, which is also a moral problem, discussed so cogently. When myth and truth contend, when the ''rounding of corners to make a better narrative'' is at odds with the facts, we must learn to make our way as skeptics. The books our society publishes must be the books we deserve, suited to the moral ambiguity of our species.</p><p>Illustration.
