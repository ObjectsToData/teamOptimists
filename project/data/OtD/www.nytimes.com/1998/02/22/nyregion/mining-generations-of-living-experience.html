Baldwin Center in Stratford on a recent morning.    It was the first meeting of a book discussion series entitled ''Good Age, Good Medicine'' -- an exploration of the role of older people as healers in traditional cultures. David Shuldiner, humanist in residence for the elderly services division of the Connecticut State Department of Social Services, had driven down from Hartford to lead the discussion of the day's selection: ''Bless Me, Ultima'' a novel by Rudolfo Anaya set in a New Mexican village. Within minutes of his introduction the participants took over, commenting on the different cultures described in the book; the coexistence of folk beliefs and traditional religion; the acceptance of magic and the power of suggestion in healing.

Baldwin Center in Stratford on a recent morning.</p><p>It was the first meeting of a book discussion series entitled ''Good Age, Good Medicine'' -- an exploration of the role of older people as healers in traditional cultures. David Shuldiner, humanist in residence for the elderly services division of the Connecticut State Department of Social Services, had driven down from Hartford to lead the discussion of the day's selection: ''Bless Me, Ultima'' a novel by Rudolfo Anaya set in a New Mexican village. Within minutes of his introduction the participants took over, commenting on the different cultures described in the book; the coexistence of folk beliefs and traditional religion; the acceptance of magic and the power of suggestion in healing.</p><p>In selecting the theme, said Mr. Shuldiner, he was guided by his own interest in traditional or alternative medicine. It was soon evident that the small, lively group around the table was well acquainted with the topic and identified strongly with the character of Ultima, the aged healer who understands the relationship between past and present and hands down her insights to the young protagonist.</p><p>The conversation flowed smoothly back and forth, from the book's setting to the participants' own experience with their grandparents, and then with grandchildren of their own.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I like to test new programs in Stratford,'' said Mr. Shuldiner after the discussion, ''because this group is one that enjoys challenges. I consider them my best guinea pigs.''</p><p>He ought to know. As humanist in residence he is familiar with the state's senior centers, nursing homes, housing facilities and all locations where older residents gather.  He has held workshops for social workers, therapists, family counselors and nursing home personnel interested in cultural opportunities for  those they serve.</p><p>Born and educated in Southern California, Mr. Shuldiner arrived in Connecticut in 1984 in response to an announcement of a 10-month position with the state's Department on Aging (now the Elderly Services Division of the Department of Social Services), a post newly created and funded by the Connecticut Humanities Council.</p><p>''I had recently completed my doctoral degree in folklore at the University of Southern California,'' said Mr. Shuldiner, a tall, rangy man in his late 40's, ''and I had written my dissertation about a group of elderly Jewish immigrants who had been active in labor and political movements in Europe and the United States.''</p><p>''I grew to appreciate not only the great privilege of sitting at the feet of these repositories of living history,'' he continued, ''but also the importance of providing an opportunity for those with whom I met to share the stories of their lives with me.''</p><p>The new position seemed made to order for someone with his training and outlook, enabling him, he has written, ''to make ample use of the tools of the folklorist's trade,'' like the ability to elicit reminiscences and stimulate dialogue on a wide variety of subjects, including local history, immigration and ethnicity, and traditional arts and music. Such programming, he believes, enables elders to assert their sense of self and community belonging.</p><p>He worked under the supervision of the Director of Community Services and his marching orders, as he calls them, were to develop and implement cultural programs for older adults throughout the state. What programs and how to take them about was up to him, as it still is.  When the 10-month grant was up, the department took over the funding and made the position permanent.</p><p>Mr. Shuldiner calls it ''the story of a successful collaboration between two public institutions not usually involved in each other's affairs'' and says he knows of no other position like it in any other state agency in the country. The fact that he has no full-time staff or program budget does not disturb him.</p><p>''I have gotten very creative piggy-backing off other projects,'' he explained. ''Working together, we find the support. So here I am, nestled within the bureaucracy, not bothered with caseloads or paperwork. I can be as creative as I like.''</p><p>Professionals in the aging field welcome his participation.</p><p>''The humanist in residence position is a tremendous resource for us,'' said Marie Guman, the outreach coordinator for Stratford Senior Services, ''and David has the capacity to relate to people from all walks of life, to let them know their input is important. Most of us have so many other responsibilities,'' she continued, ''so many pressing services to deliver. Without him we would not be able to offer these programs that are enriching to the mind and spirit.''</p><p>Mr. Shuldiner started, 14 years ago, by visiting sites where innovative programs were already in place, and then traveled throughout the state talking to older residents to get a sense of what interested them, what subjects they wanted to learn more about.</p>                </div>
