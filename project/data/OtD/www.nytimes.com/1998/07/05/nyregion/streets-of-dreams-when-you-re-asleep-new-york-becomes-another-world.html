In real life, elevators plunge into watery basements, office and apartment towers soar skyward and there is a feast of characters and symbols to feed on. Streets steam surreally, their surfaces sometimes cracking and opening into craters large enough to swallow a car or a human.</p><p>It is a city that often appears to be influenced by the jumpy logic of dreams, where from one block to the next continuity is lost and a neighborhood's mood shifts. And it continually mingles surprise with familiarity. Rumbling beneath it all is a network of tunnels and trains, a mirror, perhaps, of the unconscious.</p><p>''If you live in the city long enough,'' said Steven Marcus, a humanities professor and historian of psychoanalysis at Columbia University, ''the city itself becomes a character.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>As interviews with some 50 New Yorkers revealed, it is a character with many levels, starting with the subterranean. ''I was in the subway,'' many people say, as they begin recounting a dream. Some never emerge from their underground world, where normal rules of navigation are suspended. Some emerge to an unexpected destination, like Paris.</p><p>The city also stretches into the sky. Frederic Tuten, a novelist who lives in the East Village, described a recurring dream in which he is in a bunker on the 95th floor of the Empire State Building. And a media development executive, Carlton Roberts, says he often dreams that he is floating over Central Park, like a toy airplane.</p><p>Movies have always capitalized on New York's dreamy and nightmarish qualities. In ''Ghost,'' Patrick Swayze, who plays an investment banker killed in lower Manhattan, rides a subway endlessly. ''After Hours'' is the tale of an uptown yuppie's long nightmare when he is stranded in an alien part of the city. ''Escape From New York'' presents the city as one of the circles of hell, while Woody Allen's movies often rhapsodize about the city, turning its streets and architecture into a jazz poem.</p><p>Sigmund Freud called dreams ''the royal road to the unconscious'' and theorized that they reflected highly individual unconscious wishes. His student Carl Jung, who later broke with him, thought the recurring use of enduring symbols in dreams, like mazes, mirrors and snakes, reflected something more collective and universal.</p><p>''New York is such a fabulous place,'' said Michael Vannoy Adams, a psychoanalyst in the Jungian tradition who has written about race and the unconscious, and offers dream workshops at the New York Open Center on Spring Street. ''It offers a rich possibility for representing psychic complexity.''</p><p>You might expect that dreamers in this often hard-edged city would conjure up a host of paranoid fantasies in the same way that many movies and television shows highlight the noirish aspects of New York. But there are those whose urban dreams are surprisingly pastoral, who report a placid sense of well-being amid what others see as chaos, whose dreams are, in effect, sweeter.</p><p>''The psyche seems to be saying that the city is not cut off from nature, but presents it as almost an ideal place to be,'' said James Hillman, a psychologist, Jungian therapist and the author of some 20 books including ''The Soul's Code.'' He went on: ''Why do we build cities if we don't love them? Humankind likes being in cities.''</p><p>Is the city's highly touted drop in crime finding its way into people's subconscious? A spokesman for the American Psychoanalytic Association, Dr. Leon Hoffman, speculated that ''it may be that as a manifest symbol the city is a safer symbol than it used to be.''</p><p>Some New Yorkers' dreams reflect what seem to be universal fears and aspirations, from being lost to discovering new places to flying. ''These are all themes that you see in dreams outside of the city,'' said Robert Bosnak, a Jungian psychoanalyst who has written a few books about dreams. ''But in the city, they take on a different dress. It's as if the city becomes the clothing for the dream.''</p><p>Action-Packed And Not Always Pretty</p><p>With noise and brownouts, rusty water coming out of faucets, aggressive panhandling and aggressive policing, quality of life in New York is the subject of constant debate. It also turned up in the dreams of several people interviewed.</p><p>I dreamed that the F.D.R. ran through my living room. Instead of the southern wall of exposed bricks and windows, there were pillars like those supporting the overhang of the F.D.R., north of 34th Street. Beyond the pillars lay the East River, lapping at the radiators. Cars dashed from one end of the room to the other, on their way from Wall Street to the U.N. The noise was deafening. The kitchen had turned into the Holland Tunnel. The cabinets of pale, whitewashed maple had been scrapped, and the walls were lined with white tiles gleaming in an orangey light. The apartment wasn't a home anymore, secluded from the outside world, it was beat up by the winds. Trashed. Ripped open. Vulnerable. But it was alive with the pulse of the city.</p><p>Catherine Texier, author, East Village</p>                </div>
