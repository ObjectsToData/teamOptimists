    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="OVER the last five months, a one-acre plot of land nestled in the Staten Island Botanical Garden has been slowly transformed into an outpost of China. About 40 Chinese craftsmen have toiled nonstop to build the Chinese Scholar's Garden, an exquisite collection of pavilions, bridges and ponds. They used traditional tools or just their hands as they put into place thick cedar columns, latticed door frames and hand-finished granite panels. A tablet over the entrance declares in red and gold Chinese characters, ''The Garden Where One Experiences Many Beautiful Things.''    Yesterday it became the Garden Where Craftsmen Experience Excitement and Nervousness. I. M. Pei, the architect famous for structures like the pyramid-shaped addition to the Louvre, was standing at the garden entrance inspecting their handiwork. His interest was in architecture and ancestry, since Mr. Pei's family is known for having an impressive garden of its own back in Suzhou, China, a city famous for its scholars' gardens.  ">

I. M. Pei, the architect famous for structures like the pyramid-shaped addition to the Louvre, was standing at the garden entrance inspecting their handiwork. His interest was in architecture and ancestry, since Mr. Pei's family is known for having an impressive garden of its own back in Suzhou, China, a city famous for its scholars' gardens.</p><p>The craftsmen had traded rumpled work clothes and wooden tools for jackets and cameras, and were chatting with Mr. Pei as he strolled the grounds. His verdict was evident as he spoke to them in Chinese, punctuating his words with smiles and laughs. The noon sun cast a glow on the garden's white walls matched only by the pride on the craftsmen's faces.</p><p>''Today is a wonderful day for shapes and shadows,'' Mr. Pei said. ''I think the workmanship is excellent, and I'm impressed. Of course, you can't expect it to be like I'm used to seeing in Suzhou, but it comes quite close. I'm very impressed.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Pei had come to the garden at the invitation of his stepmother, Aileen Pei, who was vital in helping raise part of the $10 million needed for the project. This week she made a few trips to Staten Island (with cookies and cake for the workers) to show off to friends and donors the progress of the garden, which has occupied much of her attention. The landscaping will be done early next year.</p><p>She got her first glimpse of the project two years ago, when Frances Huber, president of the Staten Island Botanical Garden, showed her a model during an afternoon tea. The model was sort of bulky, so Mrs. Huber kept it in the trunk of her car when showing it off. Its surroundings notwithstanding, Mrs. Pei was impressed. Mrs. Huber was ecstatic, since she knew that Mrs. Pei's support brought a measure of artistic integrity to the garden as well as a wealth of contacts.</p><p>''There are a lot of connections that are very personal and go back and forth with the old southern China crowd,'' Mrs. Huber said. ''Many of them left right before the Second World War, and they were in finance and banking. They came to New York and maintained those friendships. This is kind of the old society crowd. They still exist. And she's the doyenne of it. A friend of hers called her the Brooke Astor of the Park Avenue Chinese.''</p><p>Mrs. Pei reached out to friends, even showing a videotaped piece on the garden to dinner guests at her Park Avenue home. She said she was lucky with the first foundation she approached, the Luce Foundation. ''To do anything in New York, it takes a lot of people,'' Mrs. Pei said. ''I know Hank Luce very well. When he gave money, the rest was easier, you know.''</p><p>ONE question that potential donors asked was: Why Staten Island? Why not spread the wealth, both cultural and financial? There is a certain appropriateness to the location, since the garden is at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, once a home for merchant seamen, some of whom no doubt saw the real thing during their travels to the East.</p><p>Which raises another question: why scholars' garden? Yangming Chu, the curator, explained that tests in the humanities were given to recruits for Government service in imperial China. Naturally, scholars scored best.</p><p>''When they retired, they wanted to create a natural garden inside the city,'' Mr. Chu said. ''When you close the door, you're in nature. It's to get away from the city's chaos and to look for beauty. How do you do that, but with a garden with trees and ponds where you can write poetry, have parties and entertain friends?''</p><p>That tradition still makes sense to today's civil servants. How many police officers have moved to Staten Island in search of solitude after a day on the beat? But no backyard could ever compete with the tea house at the scholars' garden. After his tour, Mr. Pei and his party sat down for a meal. He looked down the table and spotted a relative.</p><p>''Have you ever been to Suzhou?'' he asked the girl, who shook her head. ''You must. That's where your family comes from.''</p><p>Considering the fine example re-created in New York City, she doesn't have to hop a slow boat anywhere. The Staten Island Ferry is faster. And free.</p><p>Photo: At the Chinese Scholar's Garden in the Staten Island Botanical Garden, the architect I.M. Pei, left, discussed details of paving with Li Fugen, a craftsman.
