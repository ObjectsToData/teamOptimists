    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="If ever an academic department was hot, it was the English department at Duke University in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.    The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its flamboyant chairman in those days; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once called ''the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve Kosovsky Sedgwick, the co-founder of the growing academic field of ''queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.    But over the past year, the department has appeared to be self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the department ''without anything we would be disposed to describe as an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''    Now the university has placed the department in something resembling receivership, supervised  by an executive committee (led by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new department chairman and the first of perhaps half a dozen new professors to replace the ones who have left.    ''If the department can come up with three to six excellent hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,'' said Mr. Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke in December to become a dean at the University of Illinois in Chicago.    ''If we blow it -- and I don't know why we would, but if we were to blow it -- then after about a year or two another word will settle in. And this will be the word that, 'Well, that was nice while it lasted but it's over.' ''    It is too early to say whether the discord in the department will have any effect on enrollment.    The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of an academic department, one in which a complex mixture of ideological, generational and personality differences among its 40 members led to explosive skirmishes over hiring and tenure, graduate-student admissions and the distribution of departmental tasks and perks.    As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took root because celebrated outsiders failed to become fully integrated into departmental life.    But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English departments nationwide at a time when many have been struggling to redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent decades.    ''In the post-modern world, some of those working within literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and English professor at Duke. ''I think the problem of our department was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''    Now, five full professors, including Mr. Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Mr. Lentricchia has switched departments; another English professor has become a vice provost. Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and opportunities elsewhere.    ''I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ''I would say two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for the department I was in.''    In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from other major research universities spent several days meeting with members of the department, who, said Cathy N. Davidson, a Duke English professor, used the occasion ''almost as a confessional and went in and just sort of evacuated.''    In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department was ''in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale was ''desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna Torgovnick, a protegee of Mr. Fish, was pervasive; some professors wanted her term cut short ''at whatever emotional and professional cost.''    ''This is not to say that the department lacks excellent faculty,'' the report said. ''But the current department, except by virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered top-ranked.''    Back in the early 1980's, the Duke department was a traditional sort of place. Its members were mostly men, mostly white, mostly getting on in years: interpreters of literary figures, writers on esthetic themes, relatively untouched by the intellectual trends transforming their field. The department seemed in danger of becoming an old boys' club.    Hoping to raise Duke's profile, the university administration decided to build up the English department. In 1984 it lured Mr. Lentricchia away from Rice University. At his suggestion, it recruited Mr. Fish from Johns Hopkins to head the English department and Fredric Jameson, the Marxist critic and literary theorist, to run the Program in Literature.    They in turn recruited more stars: Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who was about to become president of the Modern Language Association; Janice Radway, who had recently studied the romance-novel genre; then Ms. Davidson, Ms. Sedgwick and Mr. Gates, along with Lee Patterson and his wife, Annabel Patterson, both now at Yale. Ms. Sedgwick is a pioneer in ''queer theory,'' an approach to literature that delves into the study of sexuality and refuses to divide the world neatly into homosexual and heterosexual.    Suddenly, the department was seen as a hotbed of literary theory. In the area of gender and literature, U.S. News and World Report would eventually rank the graduate program first in the country. Graduate student applications increased four-fold between 1985 and 1991. The department vaulted upward in the National Research Council rankings, from 27th in the country to 5th. (And certain attributes of Mr. Fish found their way into the work of his friend, David Lodge, the author of several novels satirizing academic life.)    In 1992, an external review team reported with admiration: ''We were struck by the chorus of testimony we heard from faculty outside the department that English has become a kind of engine or life-pump for the humanities at Duke, a supplier of intellectual energy and stimulation for the university at large. It is not easy to produce changes of this sort.''    Credit is widely given to Mr. Fish. In six years as chairman, Mr. Fish kept the university's resources focused on the department, acquired for it prime office space in the Gothic building that houses the president's office, and presided over what one administrator called ''a high-maintenance bunch of people, let me tell you'' with such apparent impartiality that even potential enemies came to believe he had the department's best interests at heart.    His style was not, however, notably democratic. He is said to have abolished the department's bylaws. (As he tells it, there were no bylaws when he arrived; he simply swept away rules that were making people unhappy.) His preferred leadership method was working the halls. Asked when he was going to hold a meeting, he answered, ''When there are no more issues.''    There were always more issues.    ''It was in some ways a classical pitched field of post-modern versus more traditional types of scholars and critics,'' said Reynolds Price, the novelist and a member of the department since 1958. ''The general good will that Stanley inspired made those differences seem a good deal less important than they turned out to be when Stanley wasn't there.''    The strain became increasingly apparent in the years after Mr. Fish stepped down as chairman in 1992. Camps and cliques took shape. The various factions were shifting and difficult to define, but many believe they were determined, at least in part, by degrees of enthusiasm, or lack of it, for such areas of study as gender and sexuality, African-American studies and theory.    To some, like Mr. Lentricchia, the department had become dominated by ideologues who measured the quality of one's scholarship by whether it was ideologically correct. To others, there appeared to be, as Ms. Sedgwick put it, ''a whole group of faculty who really felt that the department was too theoretical, too queer, too African-American.''    Open warfare broke out over such things as hiring, promotions, graduate student admissions and issues like which faculty members had money to bring in outside speakers. There were also longer-term resentments about disparities in teaching loads and a perception that some stars bore little of the administrative burden.    The antagonisms became especially bitter after Ms. Torgovnick took over in 1996 and, her critics say, adopted Mr. Fish's authoritarian style without his charm. They accuse her of having favored her friends, manipulated meetings, even doctored minutes -- all charges she denies. People in every camp ended up feeling like members of an embattled minority.    ''I don't think that all the problems are solely the result of her mismanagement,'' said Michael Valdez Moses, a 41-year-old associate professor who describes his field of specialization as Anglophone post-colonial literatures. ''But it's certainly the case that she made what would be by any stretch of the imagination a difficult situation into an impossible, particularly ugly one.''    What kind of department will emerge is unclear. The curriculum may become somewhat more structured than in the past. But many in the department are skeptical that the curriculum is really a problem, since the Duke department is more successful than most in landing graduate students in scarce academic jobs.    Many are equally dubious about the review committee's complaint that they lack an ''overarching departmental mission,'' a vision of what the department wants to achieve.     ''If there is an English, French or literature department in the country that has found the new sense of mission and given it a good formulation, it has a very marketable product because lots of other departments would want to buy the kit,'' Mr. Fish said. ''But I don't myself know of any. So the lack of clear mission is a feature, I believe, now of the profession and not just this department.''  ">

	data-description="If ever an academic department was hot, it was the English department at Duke University in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.    The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its flamboyant chairman in those days; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once called ''the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve Kosovsky Sedgwick, the co-founder of the growing academic field of ''queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.    But over the past year, the department has appeared to be self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the department ''without anything we would be disposed to describe as an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''    Now the university has placed the department in something resembling receivership, supervised  by an executive committee (led by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new department chairman and the first of perhaps half a dozen new professors to replace the ones who have left.    ''If the department can come up with three to six excellent hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,'' said Mr. Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke in December to become a dean at the University of Illinois in Chicago.    ''If we blow it -- and I don't know why we would, but if we were to blow it -- then after about a year or two another word will settle in. And this will be the word that, 'Well, that was nice while it lasted but it's over.' ''    It is too early to say whether the discord in the department will have any effect on enrollment.    The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of an academic department, one in which a complex mixture of ideological, generational and personality differences among its 40 members led to explosive skirmishes over hiring and tenure, graduate-student admissions and the distribution of departmental tasks and perks.    As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took root because celebrated outsiders failed to become fully integrated into departmental life.    But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English departments nationwide at a time when many have been struggling to redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent decades.    ''In the post-modern world, some of those working within literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and English professor at Duke. ''I think the problem of our department was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''    Now, five full professors, including Mr. Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Mr. Lentricchia has switched departments; another English professor has become a vice provost. Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and opportunities elsewhere.    ''I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ''I would say two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for the department I was in.''    In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from other major research universities spent several days meeting with members of the department, who, said Cathy N. Davidson, a Duke English professor, used the occasion ''almost as a confessional and went in and just sort of evacuated.''    In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department was ''in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale was ''desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna Torgovnick, a protegee of Mr. Fish, was pervasive; some professors wanted her term cut short ''at whatever emotional and professional cost.''    ''This is not to say that the department lacks excellent faculty,'' the report said. ''But the current department, except by virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered top-ranked.''    Back in the early 1980's, the Duke department was a traditional sort of place. Its members were mostly men, mostly white, mostly getting on in years: interpreters of literary figures, writers on esthetic themes, relatively untouched by the intellectual trends transforming their field. The department seemed in danger of becoming an old boys' club.    Hoping to raise Duke's profile, the university administration decided to build up the English department. In 1984 it lured Mr. Lentricchia away from Rice University. At his suggestion, it recruited Mr. Fish from Johns Hopkins to head the English department and Fredric Jameson, the Marxist critic and literary theorist, to run the Program in Literature.    They in turn recruited more stars: Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who was about to become president of the Modern Language Association; Janice Radway, who had recently studied the romance-novel genre; then Ms. Davidson, Ms. Sedgwick and Mr. Gates, along with Lee Patterson and his wife, Annabel Patterson, both now at Yale. Ms. Sedgwick is a pioneer in ''queer theory,'' an approach to literature that delves into the study of sexuality and refuses to divide the world neatly into homosexual and heterosexual.    Suddenly, the department was seen as a hotbed of literary theory. In the area of gender and literature, U.S. News and World Report would eventually rank the graduate program first in the country. Graduate student applications increased four-fold between 1985 and 1991. The department vaulted upward in the National Research Council rankings, from 27th in the country to 5th. (And certain attributes of Mr. Fish found their way into the work of his friend, David Lodge, the author of several novels satirizing academic life.)    In 1992, an external review team reported with admiration: ''We were struck by the chorus of testimony we heard from faculty outside the department that English has become a kind of engine or life-pump for the humanities at Duke, a supplier of intellectual energy and stimulation for the university at large. It is not easy to produce changes of this sort.''    Credit is widely given to Mr. Fish. In six years as chairman, Mr. Fish kept the university's resources focused on the department, acquired for it prime office space in the Gothic building that houses the president's office, and presided over what one administrator called ''a high-maintenance bunch of people, let me tell you'' with such apparent impartiality that even potential enemies came to believe he had the department's best interests at heart.    His style was not, however, notably democratic. He is said to have abolished the department's bylaws. (As he tells it, there were no bylaws when he arrived; he simply swept away rules that were making people unhappy.) His preferred leadership method was working the halls. Asked when he was going to hold a meeting, he answered, ''When there are no more issues.''    There were always more issues.    ''It was in some ways a classical pitched field of post-modern versus more traditional types of scholars and critics,'' said Reynolds Price, the novelist and a member of the department since 1958. ''The general good will that Stanley inspired made those differences seem a good deal less important than they turned out to be when Stanley wasn't there.''    The strain became increasingly apparent in the years after Mr. Fish stepped down as chairman in 1992. Camps and cliques took shape. The various factions were shifting and difficult to define, but many believe they were determined, at least in part, by degrees of enthusiasm, or lack of it, for such areas of study as gender and sexuality, African-American studies and theory.    To some, like Mr. Lentricchia, the department had become dominated by ideologues who measured the quality of one's scholarship by whether it was ideologically correct. To others, there appeared to be, as Ms. Sedgwick put it, ''a whole group of faculty who really felt that the department was too theoretical, too queer, too African-American.''    Open warfare broke out over such things as hiring, promotions, graduate student admissions and issues like which faculty members had money to bring in outside speakers. There were also longer-term resentments about disparities in teaching loads and a perception that some stars bore little of the administrative burden.    The antagonisms became especially bitter after Ms. Torgovnick took over in 1996 and, her critics say, adopted Mr. Fish's authoritarian style without his charm. They accuse her of having favored her friends, manipulated meetings, even doctored minutes -- all charges she denies. People in every camp ended up feeling like members of an embattled minority.    ''I don't think that all the problems are solely the result of her mismanagement,'' said Michael Valdez Moses, a 41-year-old associate professor who describes his field of specialization as Anglophone post-colonial literatures. ''But it's certainly the case that she made what would be by any stretch of the imagination a difficult situation into an impossible, particularly ugly one.''    What kind of department will emerge is unclear. The curriculum may become somewhat more structured than in the past. But many in the department are skeptical that the curriculum is really a problem, since the Duke department is more successful than most in landing graduate students in scarce academic jobs.    Many are equally dubious about the review committee's complaint that they lack an ''overarching departmental mission,'' a vision of what the department wants to achieve.     ''If there is an English, French or literature department in the country that has found the new sense of mission and given it a good formulation, it has a very marketable product because lots of other departments would want to buy the kit,'' Mr. Fish said. ''But I don't myself know of any. So the lack of clear mission is a feature, I believe, now of the profession and not just this department.''  "></div>

                    <p>If ever an academic department was hot, it was the English department at Duke University in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.</p><p>The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its flamboyant chairman in those days; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once called ''the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve Kosovsky Sedgwick, the co-founder of the growing academic field of ''queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.</p><p>But over the past year, the department has appeared to be self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the department ''without anything we would be disposed to describe as an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''</p><p>Now the university has placed the department in something resembling receivership, supervised  by an executive committee (led by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new department chairman and the first of perhaps half a dozen new professors to replace the ones who have left.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''If the department can come up with three to six excellent hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,'' said Mr. Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke in December to become a dean at the University of Illinois in Chicago.</p><p>''If we blow it -- and I don't know why we would, but if we were to blow it -- then after about a year or two another word will settle in. And this will be the word that, 'Well, that was nice while it lasted but it's over.' ''</p><p>It is too early to say whether the discord in the department will have any effect on enrollment.</p><p>The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of an academic department, one in which a complex mixture of ideological, generational and personality differences among its 40 members led to explosive skirmishes over hiring and tenure, graduate-student admissions and the distribution of departmental tasks and perks.</p><p>As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took root because celebrated outsiders failed to become fully integrated into departmental life.</p><p>But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English departments nationwide at a time when many have been struggling to redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent decades.</p><p>''In the post-modern world, some of those working within literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and English professor at Duke. ''I think the problem of our department was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''</p><p>Now, five full professors, including Mr. Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Mr. Lentricchia has switched departments; another English professor has become a vice provost. Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and opportunities elsewhere.</p><p>''I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ''I would say two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for the department I was in.''</p><p>In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from other major research universities spent several days meeting with members of the department, who, said Cathy N. Davidson, a Duke English professor, used the occasion ''almost as a confessional and went in and just sort of evacuated.''</p><p>In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department was ''in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale was ''desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna Torgovnick, a protegee of Mr. Fish, was pervasive; some professors wanted her term cut short ''at whatever emotional and professional cost.''</p><p>''This is not to say that the department lacks excellent faculty,'' the report said. ''But the current department, except by virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered top-ranked.''</p>                </div>
