                    <p>''It really is going to change the whole organization of knowledge,'' said Timothy P. Hoyer, head of technical services at the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley, which has been in on the cutting edge of the changes.</p><p>The numbers involved are huge: The Library of Congress, which has 117 million items in its archives, hopes to have four million items digitized and accessible on the World Wide Web by the turn of the century. The Denver Public Library expects to put 95,000 photographs of the old West on-line. California has linked 35 universities and museums into one on-line archive.</p><p>In the Public Records Office in London, archivists are creating a catalogue of all British public records dating to the Domesday Book of the 11th century.</p><p>With help from experts at New York University, the New York Historical Society is trying to digitize one of the great American history collections.</p><p>No one place is available on-line where Web users can search the finding aids for all these collections. But the Research Libraries Group, an international alliance of 160 institutions, including universities, libraries, archives and museums, has set up an Archival Resources service that is moving toward this.</p><p>''The vision goes back to the Enlightenment,'' said Daniel V. Pitti, project director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia. ''It was the dream of the scholar to go to one place and find out what exists, where it is, and what they need to get access.''</p><p>''It's an illusion to think we'll digitize everything out there -- we're talking about hundreds of millions of items,'' he added.</p><p>Copies of items that have been digitized  have occasionally been more interesting than the originals. A digitized photo of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, for example, can be manipulated to see paintings on the walls of buildings that cannot be seen in the original photograph. A piece of papyrus, enlarged on a computer, does not have to be viewed under a microscope. It was papyrus that led some archivists to think of constructing digitized collections so that valuable, fragile materials would not be harmed.</p><p>''We have 1,500 pieces of papyri dating back to 4,000 B.C.,'' said Steven Hensen, director of planning and project development in the rare book, manuscript and special collections library at Duke University.</p><p>While Duke was photographing and cataloguing its collection, he said, ''the World Wide Web burst upon the scene, and we had this flash: Why make photos? Why not scan them and see if we can put them up on the Web and make them accessible worldwide?''</p><p>Roger Bagnall, professor of classics and history at Columbia University, is heading an effort by Duke, Columbia, the University of Michigan, Berkeley, Yale and Princeton to build a virtual collection of 50,000 pieces of papyri that could eventually be linked to collections in Europe.</p><p>''We are, ultimately, going to have translations for everything that's actually been read,'' Dr. Bagnall said, ''and anything with a Greek text will also have an English text.''</p><p>What has happened in papyrus could happen with other unique collections, said Stephen M. Griffin, head of the division of information and intelligent systems at the National Science Foundation.</p><p>A collection of photographs, maps and texts at a University of Virginia Web site called ''The Valley of the Shadow,'' an archive of two communities, Staunton, Va., and Chambersburg, Pa., on opposite sides of the Mason-Dixon line during the Civil War, has been visited by two million people.</p><p>''I wanted to tell the story of the Civil War on a human level,'' said Edward Ayres, a history professor who first thought of the project. First on a computer and then on the Internet, he and a colleague, William Thomas, tried to see ''if we could put out all the raw materials out of which historians construct the past in ways people who are not historians could explore,'' Professor Ayres said.</p><p>''My dream is that you'll slowly see, in your own mind, a three-dimensional world emerge,'' he said. ''If you read the census entries and see that a soldier is 48 and has left three young children at home, and he's a widower, all of a sudden the lines in his letters have a different meaning.''</p><p>The National Endowment for the Humanities has supported this and other projects throughout the country to make cultural resources available on the Internet.</p><p>''It would gain the country little if we spent millions to preserve materials and no one knew where they were, or if we spent millions to gain access to materials that couldn't be seen because they were too fragile,'' said George Farr, director of the division of preservation and access at the endowment.</p><p>At the Library of Congress, the manuscript division is closed to high school students and most university undergraduates. Even scholars can only look at Presidential manuscripts on microfiche. But at the American Memory site, the Washington letters can be seen in their original form. The site gets 10 million to 12 million visits a month.</p><p>''Suddenly we have clients who couldn't come through our doors,'' said Mr. Hoyer, who helps direct the on-line archive of the California Digital Library.</p><p>Lisa Yesson, manager of the California Heritage project at the Berkeley library, has been helping elementary school teachers use the California Heritage Web site.</p><p>''A fourth-grade class in Oakland did a unit on the gold rush and went to Sutter's Fort,'' she said. ''Then they went to the California Heritage site to see what it looked like back in the gold rush.''</p><p>An unexpected result, she said, was the students' relationship with the university. Once teachers explained what an archive was, the students wanted to come to campus to see the real thing.</p><p>''This is one of the few times that archivists have found themselves leading the parade,'' Mr. Hensen said. ''We're used to sweeping up behind the elephants.''</p><p>Photos: Among the hundreds of documents now available on the Internet is an Egyptian papyrus, left, dating to the second century B.C.
