    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" California's Over  By Louis B. Jones. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.    In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the 1970's, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and inflated sense of destiny. The result is ''a satirical elegy for the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ''The book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County setting.''    My Name Escapes Me: The Diary of a Retiring Actor  By Alec Guinness. Penguin, $12.95.    Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80, the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it all, ''Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ''Sir Alec is an accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''    Bob the Gambler  By Frederick Barthelme.  Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.    This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a family that wagers its comfortable life style on a chance to escape the banality of middle-class existence. ''It is Barthelme's peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A. O. Scott said here last year.    Japan: A Reinterpretation  By Patrick Smith. Vintage, $14.    A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer, Frank Gibney, called this ''a stimulating, provocative book.'' GEISHA, by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California, $17.95), tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to Japan in the mid-1970's to study the female entertainers known as geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been reissued with a new preface, is marked by ''delicate observation and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.    The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness  By Rick Bass. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.    These three novellas cover a lot of ground -- from Canada to Mississippi -- but they share a precise observation of nature that is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ''Reading this book has made me glad . . . that there are still writers who can bring the wilderness back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said here last year.    A Book of Memories  By Peter Nadas. Translated by Ivan Sanders.  Penguin, $14.95.    This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the universe of Communist East Berlin and Budapest. ''The terrain of Eastern European experience . . . gains an amplitude and an illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote here last year. The Land of Green Plums, by Herta Muller, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra Books/Northwestern University, $14.95), is a grim novel about a group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ''Muller's vision . . . reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.    Doo-Dah!  Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture  By Ken Emerson. Da Capo, $16.95.    The creator of ''Oh! Susanna,'' ''Camptown Races'' and other enduring tunes from the 1800's was the first American songwriter to achieve artistic independence from Europe. This is ''a vigorous, thoroughly researched, amiably chatty tour through his life and times,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here last year.    Required Reading: Why Our American Classics Matter Now  By Andrew Delbanco.  Noonday/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $12.    Seeking to give new urgency to the works of Melville, Thoreau and nine other writers, a humanities professor argues that the best American writing reflects political values in line with those of liberal democracy. ''Delbanco's essays are effortlessly erudite and smoothly readable,'' Jonathan Rosen said here last year.    PR! A Social History of Spin  By Stuart Ewen. Basic Books, $17.    In tracing the evolution of public relations, the author shows how the hype machine has persuaded Americans to buy everything from new cars to new wars, and how it has undermined our political discourse. Last year in these pages, Judith Newman called this an ''exhaustive and ambitious study.''    The Wonder Worker  By Susan Howatch. Fawcett Columbine, $14.    A young woman's obsession with the charismatic leader of a London parish sets off a chain of events that includes a possible murder and a suicide. Last year our reviewer, Betsy Groban, said that despite its implausible ending, this is ''an absorbing novel.''   Scott Veale  ">

	data-description=" California's Over  By Louis B. Jones. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.    In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the 1970's, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and inflated sense of destiny. The result is ''a satirical elegy for the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ''The book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County setting.''    My Name Escapes Me: The Diary of a Retiring Actor  By Alec Guinness. Penguin, $12.95.    Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80, the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it all, ''Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ''Sir Alec is an accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''    Bob the Gambler  By Frederick Barthelme.  Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.    This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a family that wagers its comfortable life style on a chance to escape the banality of middle-class existence. ''It is Barthelme's peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A. O. Scott said here last year.    Japan: A Reinterpretation  By Patrick Smith. Vintage, $14.    A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer, Frank Gibney, called this ''a stimulating, provocative book.'' GEISHA, by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California, $17.95), tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to Japan in the mid-1970's to study the female entertainers known as geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been reissued with a new preface, is marked by ''delicate observation and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.    The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness  By Rick Bass. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.    These three novellas cover a lot of ground -- from Canada to Mississippi -- but they share a precise observation of nature that is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ''Reading this book has made me glad . . . that there are still writers who can bring the wilderness back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said here last year.    A Book of Memories  By Peter Nadas. Translated by Ivan Sanders.  Penguin, $14.95.    This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the universe of Communist East Berlin and Budapest. ''The terrain of Eastern European experience . . . gains an amplitude and an illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote here last year. The Land of Green Plums, by Herta Muller, translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra Books/Northwestern University, $14.95), is a grim novel about a group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ''Muller's vision . . . reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.    Doo-Dah!  Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture  By Ken Emerson. Da Capo, $16.95.    The creator of ''Oh! Susanna,'' ''Camptown Races'' and other enduring tunes from the 1800's was the first American songwriter to achieve artistic independence from Europe. This is ''a vigorous, thoroughly researched, amiably chatty tour through his life and times,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here last year.    Required Reading: Why Our American Classics Matter Now  By Andrew Delbanco.  Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12.    Seeking to give new urgency to the works of Melville, Thoreau and nine other writers, a humanities professor argues that the best American writing reflects political values in line with those of liberal democracy. ''Delbanco's essays are effortlessly erudite and smoothly readable,'' Jonathan Rosen said here last year.    PR! A Social History of Spin  By Stuart Ewen. Basic Books, $17.    In tracing the evolution of public relations, the author shows how the hype machine has persuaded Americans to buy everything from new cars to new wars, and how it has undermined our political discourse. Last year in these pages, Judith Newman called this an ''exhaustive and ambitious study.''    The Wonder Worker  By Susan Howatch. Fawcett Columbine, $14.    A young woman's obsession with the charismatic leader of a London parish sets off a chain of events that includes a possible murder and a suicide. Last year our reviewer, Betsy Groban, said that despite its implausible ending, this is ''an absorbing novel.''   Scott Veale  "></div>
