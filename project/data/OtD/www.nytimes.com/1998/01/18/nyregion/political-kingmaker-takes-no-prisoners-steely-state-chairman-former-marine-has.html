Powers, is this: He was a Marine Corps sergeant, and loved it.    In his Albany office, a bumper sticker that reads, ''What part of Marine do you not understand?'' is plastered over Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross's name on a plaque certifying her 1994 election. (Mr. Powers helped engineer her removal from Gov. George E. Pataki's 1998 ticket.) Behind his desk hangs a red-and-gold Marine Corps flag. And in a closet back home on his 100-acre Columbia County farm hangs his crisply pressed Marine Corps uniform, waiting for the next Memorial Day parade.  ">

During the 1993 New York City mayoral race, he used his car to block a busload of people who he claimed were trying to vote twice, and was almost arrested for it.</p><p>After Mr. Pataki's 1994 victory, he orchestrated the ouster of several Republican leaders he viewed as disloyal. And with his patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, he has assembled the most aggressive fund-raising machine in memory, giving the Republicans a huge money advantage over the Democrats.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Now, as the Republicans' statewide officeholders -- Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Pataki and Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco -- prepare to seek re-election, Mr. Powers is steeling himself and his operation for another year of brass-knuckles campaigning.</p><p>Already, his fund-raising phone bank is working seven days a week. Already, he is distributing fliers branding every Democrat in sight a jelly-spined liberal. Already, he has accused Geraldine A. Ferraro, who is running for the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. D'Amato, of profiting from her husband's ''flea-bag hotels and porno palaces.''</p><p>''Powers's attitude is: 'I'm a Marine. I take it, I keep it, and you've got to take it back,' '' said Ed Donnelly, a union organizer who has tangled with the Republican leader for years. ''That was how he said they would run the 1994 campaign: 'No quarter. And when we win, we aren't going to forgive and forget.' And that's how it will be in 1998.''</p><p>Political scientists say Mr. Powers is a throwback to Tammany Hall-style politics in more ways than just his tough-guy exterior. For decades, New York governors have created state political organizations in their own images, handpicking chairmen who follow their every order. But Mr. Powers, who had already rebuilt the state party when Mr. Pataki was still an obscure state senator, played a major role in promoting Mr. Pataki's candidacy, not vice versa.</p><p>''Since World War I, at least, we haven't seen a New York State party leader of this independence and strength in the Governor's party,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist who is associate dean at the State University of New York at New Paltz. ''He is something extremely rare in American politics today.''</p><p>Of course Mr. Powers's strength stems in large part from his patron and former employer, Mr. D'Amato. But Republicans say that Mr. Powers is one of the few people to whom Mr. D'Amato defers on political matters. ''There's real affection, a real confluence of interests between the two,'' said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the party.</p><p>To many Democrats and disaffected Republicans, Mr. Powers harks back to a style of politics best left in the past. They contend that he is bullying and obsessed with patronage; that his fund-raising tactics push the boundaries of the law; that he is a mechanic with no vision or ideals.</p><p>''I once asked Powers what the party's philosophical position was on certain issues,'' said Herbert London, a professor of humanities at New York University who was the Republicans' unsuccessful candidate for state comptroller in 1994. ''He looked at me quizzically and then said, 'I can answer that in one word: winning.' That pretty much embodies the Powers approach.''</p><p>But even his critics admire the organization Mr. Powers has built from the ashes of the calamitous 1990 election, when the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pierre Rinfret, finished a distant second to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and left the party $1.5 million in debt. Unlike the state parties of Mr. Cuomo and former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, which collapsed after their patrons moved on, Mr. Powers may have created an apparatus that could survive the departure of Mr. D'Amato or Mr. Pataki, many Democrats say. And they want their party to do the same.</p><p>''The Republicans realized the importance of an independent state party,'' said Bill Lynch, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''It was a mistake that the Democrats made the party too tied to the Governor, and once he was gone, the party was gone.''</p><p>Broadly built, with bristly brown hair and icy blue eyes, the soft-spoken Mr. Powers can be courtly one minute, then tell rude jokes about someone's personal habits the next. Friends say he is accessible, loyal and even sensitive. He defers often to his wife, Judy, a sculptor with a passion for Native American art who counsels him to ''listen, don't talk.''</p><p>William Dodd Powers was born 56 years ago in Nassau County, where his great-grandfather helped found the Republican organization.</p>                </div>
