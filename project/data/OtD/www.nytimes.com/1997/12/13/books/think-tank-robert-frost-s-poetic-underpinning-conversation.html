    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In an essay in the most recent issue of the quarterly journal Modern Age, Peter J. Stanlis, Distinguished Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, at Rockford College in Illinois, argues that conversation was the critical element in Robert Frost's poetry and was the basis for his theory of language. Rather than conventional literary usage, he contends, Frost was after a ''poetry that talked.'' Here are excerpts from Professor Stanlis's essay.    From around 1913 until Robert Frost's death in January 1963, almost everyone who knew him personally agreed that he was among the most brilliant, provocative, learned, and original conversationalists of the 20th century. There is no doubt that from early manhood until his death, the poet believed that next to poetry itself, the art of conversation with sophisticated literary friends was the great social, esthetic, and intellectual passion of his life.

	data-description="In an essay in the most recent issue of the quarterly journal Modern Age, Peter J. Stanlis, Distinguished Professor of Humanities, Emeritus, at Rockford College in Illinois, argues that conversation was the critical element in Robert Frost's poetry and was the basis for his theory of language. Rather than conventional literary usage, he contends, Frost was after a ''poetry that talked.'' Here are excerpts from Professor Stanlis's essay.    From around 1913 until Robert Frost's death in January 1963, almost everyone who knew him personally agreed that he was among the most brilliant, provocative, learned, and original conversationalists of the 20th century. There is no doubt that from early manhood until his death, the poet believed that next to poetry itself, the art of conversation with sophisticated literary friends was the great social, esthetic, and intellectual passion of his life.

There is no doubt that from early manhood until his death, the poet believed that next to poetry itself, the art of conversation with sophisticated literary friends was the great social, esthetic, and intellectual passion of his life.</p><p>Fortunately, the dramatic moment of epiphany in Frost's life as a poet is provided by him, when he experienced the esthetic revelation of how, in general, his conversation was related to his early poetry.</p><p>Frost's sudden flash of insight and intuitive understanding occurred in 1895, at age 21. It was like a divine revelation to one of God's elect, because it provided him with the essential principle and objective of his whole esthetic theory and future practice as a poet. It is necessary to quote Frost's passage on this event, reported retrospectively, because it reveals how his response led him to test whether his revolutionary perception was valid:</p>                </div>

                    <p>''One day as we talked, [the Reverend William Hayes Ward] said to me that when he read my poems it was just like hearing me talk. I didn't know until then what it was I was after. When he said that to me it all became clear. I was after poetry that talked. If my poems were talking poems -- if to read one of them you hear a voice -- that would be to my liking! So I went to the great poets, from Chaucer and Shakespeare to Coleridge and Wordsworth and looked for this very thing in their lines. I will admit, when I have been quoted on the matter I have been made to speak rather mistily. But one thing must always be kept in mind: whenever I write a line it is because that line has already been spoken clearly by a voice within my mind, an audible voice.</p><p>''I have unconsciously tried to do just what Chaucer did when the language was young and untried and virile. I have sought only those words I had met up with as a boy in New Hampshire, working on farms during the summer vacations. I listened to the men with whom I worked and found that I could make out their conversation as they talked together out of earshot, even when I had not plainly heard the words they spoke. When I started to carry their conversation over into poetry. I could hear their voices, and the sound posture differentiated between one and the other. It was the sense of sound I have been talking about. In some sort of way like this I have been able to write poetry, where characters talk and though not without infinite pains, to make it plain to the reader which character is saying the lines without having to place his name before it, as is done in the drama.''</p><p>Although as Frost himself said, no poet ever wrote in order to fulfill a theory of a writing, it is evident that in the decade or more before he went to England, he was consciously developing his theory of language as a vehicle for ''correspondence'' between a writer or speaker and his audience. His revolutionary conception of language applied not only to his poetry but to all spoken and written prose sentences. As both a poet and a classroom teacher of composition, Frost believed that ''oral reading'' through a close attention to the ''voice posturing'' of speakers and their changes in ''voice tones,'' so natural without inflated literary rhetoric in actual conversation, was the most valid and effective method of conveying meaning in both writing and reading, whether poetry or prose.</p><p>His theory goes to the heart of his entire esthetic philosophy and conception of art and is ultimately a vital part of his great skill and power both as a conversationalist and poet.</p><p>Photo: Robert Frost in the 1920's.
