''There are lies of omission in the media, and this history is needed. We have all these books on Polish, Italian and Afro-American immigration, but nothing on Puerto Rican immigrants. There are just social books looking at the massive problems.''</p><p>Although she acknowledges that there might be people criticizing her for chronicling Puerto Rican history when she is basically an ''outsider,'' Dr. Glasser remains committed to the task.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''For the community itself this is so important, but I want the general public to understand as well,'' she said. ''If you don't know the history of a group, you make an argument of causality when in fact it's more complex. You have to understand the colonial situation in Puerto Rico, and United States domination, and how immigration was encouraged. Some say Puerto Ricans came here because of over-population; others say it was Operation Bootstrap and the displacement of farmers. The whole idea of America as the Promised Land is a myth. There are many people who wouldn't have chosen to come here because they loved their homes.''</p><p>''Aqui Me Quedo,'' published by the Connecticut Humanities Council, is one of only two books that the agency has published. Talks and lectures by Dr. Glasser this fall were also financed by the humanities council, as well as by the Latino Artists Group of Waterbury. Although the book is not currently available in bookstores, copies are available at the council's Middletown offices.</p><p>The path that led Dr. Glasser to document Puerto Rican history was itself somewhat convoluted. ''I went to graduate school inadvertently,'' she explained. ''I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do at Yale. I had studied comparative literature, but I wanted the historical context. I had been a Vista volunteer teaching literacy in North Carolina before that, and that experience changed my life. I knew I wanted to do work with people rather than be an academic.''</p><p>After earning her bachelor's degree in comparative literature from the University of Wisconsin/Madison, and while working on her master's and doctorate in American studies at Yale, Dr. Glasser became involved in organizing an ethnic music festival in Waterbury with another historian, Jeremy Brecher, and Marie Galbraith, director of community programs at the Mattatuck Museum.</p><p>''When I started to work on that project in 1986, I had to bring an interpreter along,'' Dr. Glasser said. ''I spent most of the next summer in Mexico, in total language immersion, and the following summer started historical research in Spanish. I wanted to be able to do my interviews in whatever language people felt comfortable with. It was a process, though. Spanish in Puerto Rico wasn't at all like the Spanish spoken in Mexico. Spanish and writing became like obsessions, and finally becoming fluent in Spanish has opened up world views for me.''</p><p>She went on to work on a project documenting Puerto Rican music in Waterbury for a series on ethnic music on Connecticut Public Radio.  This ignited her interest, and she began work on her first book, ''My Music Is My Flag: Puerto Rican Musicians and Their New York Communities, 1917-1940.'' The book evolved from her doctoral dissertation, and was a rather academic work, Dr. Glasser explained. Two years later, the publication of ''Aqui Me Quedo'' finds her with a different agenda.</p><p>''This was an attempt to be more accessible, to make it simple and well written,'' she said. ''I don't like academic, pretentious jargon. The book is written at a high school level, and could be used for community groups, bilingual education or community college classes.''</p><p>The book is not only accessible, it is written in both English and Spanish, and even the oral histories that supplement each page are translated in both languages. Readers can skip back and forth between both languages, reading the first person account of immigrant experiences, but also capturing the flavor of the language.</p><p>''Non-Latinos have been very positive, especially those who work in school systems and social services,'' Dr. Glasser said. ''My hope is to get the book into schools and have it filter out to communities that way.''</p><p>Her next step, she added, will probably be to write children's books focusing on the Puerto Rican community. Plans also include offering a teachers' workshop and putting together a study guide, music and film for ''Aqui Me Quedo.''</p><p>A third book is in the works, on Puerto Ricans in Waterbury and the impact of urban renewal. ''A lot of physical evidence, that of stores, community groups and neighborhoods, has been razed by bulldozers,'' Dr. Glasser said. ''James Baldwin coined the term 'Negro removal.' This is true of Puerto Ricans as well in terms of urban renewal.''</p><p>As Dr. Glasser explains, ''I would eventually like to see an archive of Puerto Rican and Latino materials, and a program to train oral historians. Not all Latinos are Puerto Rican, and their histories are even more neglected. I'm only one person and I can only do so much. Everyone should go out with a tape recorder and record their histories.''</p><p>As for the stereotypes implying that all Puerto Ricans are gang members or on welfare, she added, ''I won't convert the hard-core bigots, but I can make comparisons between Puerto Rican immigrants and early immigrants. Why is it that the Puerto Ricans received such a poor reception from other immigrants who received a poor reception in the first place?''</p><p>While many immigrants have been assimilated into their American communities, Dr. Glasser said,  people must value the wish of many to retain their language and customs. ''There are many who want to hang onto their culture and this is threatening to other immigrant groups,'' she said. ''Why should they wish that same horrible experience -- not being able to speak their language at all -- on others? Why can't they preserve their language? The attitude seems to be all or nothing, taking pride in being monolingual, yet I think we should all try to be bilingual.''</p><p>The attitude of culturally patriotic Puerto Ricans has caused friction, Dr. Glasser added. ''Some people are in the same boat, but there are big cultural differences. The Puerto Ricans can't necessarily identify with another group. Also, about 31 percent of the Latinos here are from places other than Puerto Rico. The easternmost and westernmost parts of the state are seeing a lot of change.''</p><p>''Aqui Me Quedo,'' she added, is not intended to be a comprehensive look at Puerto Ricans in Connecticut, but rather representative of the communities. ''It is a sampling of the diversity of the Puerto Rican experience, the different classes, races, years of migration, and religious beliefs in many different Connecticut communities. I touch upon the fact that the experience is extremely diverse,'' she said. ''It is an ongoing process. There is very spotty information about the 19th-century immigrants, and there is much more work to be done.''</p><p>Photo: Ruth Glasser, historian, granddaughter of European immigrants, has a passion for writing about Hispanic arrivals.
