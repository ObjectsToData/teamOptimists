                    <p>AT the Pennington-Grimes School in Mount Vernon last month, Principal Thomas Pesce and his young charges were in a joyous frame of mind -- and not only because of the holiday season.</p><p>The principal had just learned that his elementary school, in the heart of the ethnically diverse city, was a high scorer for reading on a state report card issued by the Board of Regents and the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills.</p><p>''Reading is king in our school!'' declared an unabashedly proud Mr. Pesce. The school was rated along with more than 4,000 others throughout New York in a program aimed at making all schools accountable to the public.</p><p>From the modest residential neighborhood where Pennington-Grimes is situated to the tough streets of southwest Yonkers and the rolling hills and estates in the northern suburbs of the county, many Westchester school administrators expressed pleasure with the test scores. The ratings were made known to them last month and officially released to the public on Friday, which is being called New York State School Report Card Day.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But for some educators -- in Westchester's poor cities and its wealthy communities alike -- the report cards came as a harsh wake-up call that their schools were performing poorly.</p><p>The Montessori Humanities and Creative Arts School in Yonkers was a high scorer for the county for third-grade reading along with others like Pound Ridge Elementary School, Greenacres School in Scarsdale and Purchase School in Harrison. The Montessori School was the sixth highest in the state, excluding very small schools, with 74 percent reading at mastery, or advanced-reading, levels. When the scores were adjusted to account for differences in student backgrounds -- as measured by family income -- some surprising schools turned up as low performers. They included the Mamaroneck Avenue School in Mamaroneck and the Edgewood School in Scarsdale as well as some schools in poorer cities like Yonkers and Mount Vernon.</p><p>At the high-performing schools, educators like Mr. Pesce at Pennington-Grimes and Principal Kathleen P. MacSweeney at the Montessori School in Yonkers credited well-honed curriculums for their pupils' success.</p><p>''There's no one single magical key to reading proficiency,'' Mr. Pesce said. ''It's a series of measures that we take.''</p><p>He said that phonics, even though the methodology is not in vogue, is heavily stressed in the early grades at Pennington-Grimes along with remediation as early as kindergarten -- ''before small reading problems get to be big ones.''</p><p>Ms. MacSweeney credited the Montessori method, explaining that the curriculum helps children focus first on concrete examples and then move to abstract concepts. Teachers at her school also work with pupils over a two-year period, providing more consistency in the learning process.</p><p>''We also allow each child to move at his or his own pace,'' she said. ''You can't underestimate the importance of that.''</p><p>At the low-performing schools, educators studied the statistics for clues to poor scores.</p><p>The Mount Vernon Superintendent of Schools, William C. Prattella, observed that Pennington-Grimes, unlike the other elementary schools in the district, is not predominantly black and Hispanic, but he declined to elaborate. Seven other Mount Vernon elementary schools were low performers.</p><p>In Mamaroneck, a predominantly white district, Dr. Sherry P. King, the Superintendent of Schools, also said the racial makeup of the poor-performing elementary school contributed to low reading performance.</p><p>''There are far more minority students at the Mamaroneck Avenue School than at our other schools, and for about half of those students English is not the first language,'' Dr. King said.</p><p>''We assume that Westchester is one kind of community when it's not. Diversity exists even within communities,'' she said. ''But in the final analysis, all that is irrelevant, because all children need to be able to read and write and think.''</p><p>The dialogue sparked by release of the report cards is precisely what Commissioner Mills has been hoping for. ''Communities need to be asking: What can we do to make higher standards come to life? What are the problems? What are the solutions?'' he said recently.</p><p>The Commissioner has described the report cards, which include data from state test results, as catalysts for public discussion. He said they are meant to draw a picture of each school over a three-year period, show comparisons of individual schools with others in the state and document how students are meeting state-set criteria for minimum competency and mastery of subjects.</p><p>Described another way, the report cards are meant to provoke the question, What makes a good school?</p><p>Also being discussed is whether the amount of tax money spent for each pupil by the school district affects performance. What role does the ratio of teachers to students play? Is the racial makeup of a school a critical factor? Do rich homes produce better readers than poor ones?</p><p>Clearly, poverty and limited English proficiency are linked to lower scores. Of 38 high-performing schools for third-grade reading in the county, only 4 listed more than 10 percent of the pupils as eligible for free lunches. In only 2 were more than 10 percent of the student body listed as having limited English proficiency.</p>                </div>
