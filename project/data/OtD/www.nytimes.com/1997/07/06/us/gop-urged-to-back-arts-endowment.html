                    <p>It was probably too late to change Mr. Hill's mind. At his town meeting he said he still believed ''the best solution is to get government out of it.'' He said he believed the public would pay for a new, privately supported version of the endowment.</p><p>But elsewhere across the nation during this week's Congressional recess, there were quieter, private meetings going on with other, less committed representatives, mostly Republicans.</p><p>There were also public appeals for support that included a letter by more than 100 corporate chief executives to Speaker Newt Gingrich and a news conference on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, flanked by other members of Congress and four modern dancers in gold lame leotards. Mr. D'Amato promised to win the fight in the Senate. ''We will win it for our children,'' he said on Tuesday.</p><p>The lobbying effort was peaking because next week the House will vote on the endowment's spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Appropriations Committee recommended only $10 million, down from the current year's $99.6 million and President Clinton's request for $136 million.</p><p>Overturning the $10 million recommendation will be tough for the endowment's supporters. Before they can vote on the merits of the issue, they will probably have to win a procedural vote over the rules for considering the bill.</p><p>A defeat in the House would not end the agency's existence. The Senate is almost sure to support continued spending at this year's level or more, and the issue will be fought out in a House-Senate conference.</p><p>Here Mr. Hill argued that years of controversy over grants made by the endowment had made it more troublesome, as a Federal entity, than it was worth.</p><p>After listening to descriptions of local grants between $500 and $50,000 (Montana got a total of $593,691 this year), he said the comparatively small contribution from the endowment ''could be replaced by a national organization that is privately run.''</p><p>His local critics questioned how that would work, and Jane Alexander, chairwoman of the endowment, scoffed at the idea. ''I think it's very pie in the sky,'' she said in a telephone interview.</p><p>To operate at its current level, she said, the endowment would have to either raise capital of $8 billion and live off the interest, or raise $100 million every year, which would put it in competition with the very groups it now helps. The endowment is currently forbidden by law from accepting private donations.</p><p>The idea that plenty of private money was available was scotched in the letter to Mr. Gingrich from the corporate executives, including Paul A. Allaire of Xerox, Philip M. Condit of Boeing, H. Laurance Fuller of Amoco, Donald Hall of Hallmark and John E. Pepper Jr. of Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>They wrote on Wednesday: ''Our companies have, and will continue to, support the arts and humanities. However, the corporate world is not able to carry the entire burden of the cost of cultural access, awareness and education. As cuts in the budgets of Federal and state government place new burdens on the philanthropic sector, the arts and humanities face increasingly intense competition from social service and other sectors.''</p><p>Christina Martin, Mr. Gingrich's press secretary, said the letter had not been received and declined to comment.</p><p>One argument heard at the Helena town meeting from Arnie Malina, head of Helena Presents, a local arts group, was that in this rural state with few big corporations, national endowment money had reached every county and every small town.</p><p>''Montana is the sort of state, the kind of area, the N.E.A. was originally designed to help,'' he said. ''It really and truly does create access to the arts -- true, democratic and complete access to the arts.''</p><p>In Baton Rouge, La., James Borders, executive director of the Louisiana Arts Council, made a similar case and said Louisiana uses the $443,000 it gets from the endowment ''to help support 34 of our most important local arts agencies.''</p><p>''To not have it would be devastating,'' he said.</p><p>In Deadwood, S.D., Janet Brown, executive director of South Dakotans for the Arts, said she had met twice with that state's new freshman Republican, Representative John Thune, to stress that endowment money reached every school district in the state.</p><p>The emphasis on the endowment's effects on schools was also the message in Illinois, where Alene Valkanis, head of the Illinois Arts Alliance, said her group and others were stressing that about half their grants went to education.</p><p>There have been no major uproars over specific grants in recent years comparable to those that surrounded the 1989 grants to two artists, Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. Mr. Serrano's work included a photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine. Mr. Mapplethorpe's pictures showed unusual homosexual activities.</p><p>But Mr. Hill, echoing conservative Christian groups, insisted: ''It isn't ended. We still hear reports every year about new controversial projects.''</p><p>The opponents' pressure has driven down the appropriations, which reached a high of $180 million in 1992 during the Bush Administration.</p><p>''It's a political issue,'' Ms. Alexander said. She said arguments like those of Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, that government shouldn't be in the arts business were specious.</p><p>''The Government has been in the arts since the very beginning,'' she said.</p><p>Representative Hill was not the only opponent of the endowment at the Helena meeting. A gemstone cutter said, ''We can't afford it,'' and another man who did not identify himself said: ''This is just another social program, and the Depression is over with. We just don't need this. If an artist can't go out and make it on his own, he'd just as well find some other work.''</p><p>But they were plainly in the minority. The audience sided with supporters like Susan Anderson, executive secretary of the Helena Symphony, who explained that its $500 grant generated an additional $3,500 in matching private gifts.</p><p>That was not much in the symphony's budget of $86,000, Mr. Hill said. But it was, she said, because ''we don't have a lot of places to draw on for private funding, and we're doing everything we know how to do.''</p>                </div>
