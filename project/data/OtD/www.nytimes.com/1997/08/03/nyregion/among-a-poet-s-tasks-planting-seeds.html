''Spiritualism is one more opportunity to claim who I really am.''</p><p>The Sunken Garden Poetry Festival at the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington is a draw for crowds eager to hear what's happening in poetry and music, and Ms. Ayala will be there to read from her work on Wednesday evening this week.</p><p>Many Connecticut residents may have encountered her already in her roles as a master teaching artist with the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, working in schools, community centers and prisons; an arts administrator who began the Inner City Cultural Development Project, a joint program of the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and the Institute for Community Research in New Haven. She also founded the New Haven Alliance for the Arts and Culture and helped organize New Haven's first International Festival of Arts and Ideas. As a consultant for the Charter Oak Cultural Center she designed the Words Alive Project, a program taking contemporary authors to Hartford schools.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Not surprisingly, when arts administration came into her life, her writing time dwindled. ''Artists struggle for success,'' she said, ''then it seems like you're struggling to make more and more time. You have to fight success itself.''</p><p>After her book came out in June, she vowed to get to work on new poems and prose. ''Reading and being with people is important; book sales are always linked to authors going out and reading,'' she explained. On the other hand, she said, ''Now I am working on some stories and a second book of poetry, that brings spiritual life, or part of it, into the poems. These are the philosophies I live out in my life. The stories are about the same thing; people who come in touch with their spiritual side in daily life.''</p><p>What might be different for Ms. Ayala is the language of expression. When she arrived in New Haven from Puerto Rico at the age of 15, she vowed to learn to write as well in English as she could in Spanish. Now, at age 33, she feels she has accomplished that. ''My work will be in a new vein, bilingual,'' she explained. ''I've been writing more in Spanish.  I'm getting to know myself all over as a poet in Spanish.''</p><p>Ms. Ayala, who was born in New Haven but whose family returned to Puerto Rico before she was 1, returned when her parents gave her permission to live with an aunt. She  was, she says, obsessed with seeing the city of her birth. Unfortunately, once she saw it she wanted to go home, but her mother couldn't send plane fare. Ms. Ayala waited it out at Lee High School, and began to find some meaning in her life.</p><p>''I had never been in such a mixed environment. There were Africans, African-Americans, Japanese, Chinese,'' she said. ''This was one of the great things about coming here, coming across people from everywhere.''</p><p>She threw herself into her new life,  becoming an activist working to keep the high school open. The next step, college, temporarily dampened her spirits. ''I decided to go to Wheaton,''  she said. ''I encountered a lot of prejudice there and just fell flat. I came back to New Haven after that year and vowed to educate myself. I took lots of odd jobs, in order to have the freedom to write and read.''</p><p>She decided not to return to her parents' home. ''I was the first woman to leave my house who wasn't running off with a man, getting married or already pregnant,'' she said. ''It was my greatest declaration of independence. I felt like a writer because I didn't measure myself by anyone else's standards, but I really became a writer at 18 when I went off by myself.''</p><p>She found mentors in the Hispanic community, continued writing and quickly found herself in demand in schools where children, and teachers, needed help with writing.</p><p>''It is bizarre to go help someone who's been in the system for 25 years,'' she said. ''But I am protecting the rights to a good education. Children get lots of analytical thinking, but no intuitive thinking. Oftentimes, I'm brought in to undo institutional damage. I address children's blocks to learning; this feels like being an activist.''</p><p>With third graders, Ms. Ayala said,  ''I plant a little seed and if they get it, it's a miracle.'' She also feels a strong connection to urban teen-agers. ''I came from where they come from,'' she said. ''It is a hundred times tougher to be an inner-city teen in the United States now. My teen-ness is still very much with me. They need adults to treat them as adults and equals, and then you can build bridges that connect.''</p><p>As she puts it, ''Kids who are lucky enough to have families can't even connect anymore. You're so dependent on family when you're in a foreign country, and if it falls apart, you are in big trouble. Kids often don't see the place where their parents have come from. I like programs that bridge that gap, and give kids some history.''</p>                </div>
