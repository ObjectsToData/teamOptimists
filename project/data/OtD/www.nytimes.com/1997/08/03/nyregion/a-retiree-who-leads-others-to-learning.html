                    <p>Q. Why did you not just retire and go off into the sunset or travel, or the like?</p><p>A. It seemed important to me to do something more. I loved working with children, and when I first retired I worked as a volunteer in the early childhood intervention program, and that was wonderful for me because I was able to use my expertise and stay in touch with things. Then I started to work with WISH, Women in Self Help. But it wasn't enough.</p><p>I and some other retirees had this vision of a retirement institute. I thought it was a wonderful, wonderful idea. And we made it happen. It's important for me to spend my time in ways other than pure self-indulgence. It has always been important for me to think that I make a contribution in some way.</p><p>Q. Can you describe the institute?</p><p>A. It's a membership institute. We're in the academic community of Iona College. We offer study groups and other cultural activities for men and women of retirement age. We are a completely volunteer group, and we differ from other academic institutions in that we offer only daytime activities. We are a community. We become very important to each other.</p><p>Q. Is it important, therefore, that this is only for retirees? Sometimes older people who go back to school like being among a lot of young people and sometimes they do not.</p><p>A. Yes, the idea for us here is that we are only people of retirement age. I think there are probably as many people that find it very important to have that stimulation of the younger generation as there are people who don't want it. I think it's wonderful to have that stimulation but also to have the other option as well.</p><p>Q.  Here you are working with older people when you spent most of your professional life working with children. What is the common ingredient? Are the older people who come to your programs like 3 and 4-yearolds in that they are curious?</p><p>A. That's for sure, that is a very important aspect to the kind of people we have here. They are very curious about so many things. And the wonderful thing about our groups is that it is proof positive that just because one retires one need not, as you said earlier, go off into the sunset. It's a time in life when we can do things that you never did before and learn about new things you never learned about before.</p><p>Q. How many people do you have as members of your organization?</p><p>A. We have grown, and we have close to 200 members from lower Westchester, for the most part.</p><p>Q. How do you decide which courses to offer?</p><p>A. By committee; we have a curriculum committee. And within the committee there are three subcommittees: humanities, science and social studies. Sometimes there is someone who offers to be the instructor.</p><p>Q. Is there a charge to take these courses?</p><p>A. Oh, yes, we charge a membership fee of $150 annually, but it's a bargain because for that one membership fee you may take all of the classes. It runs from Sept. 1 to Aug. 30, and we offer two eight-session semesters and two mini-sessions. For your $150, you can sign up for them all.</p><p>Q. Clearly, this is fun for you. What makes it so much fun?</p><p>A. Doing something you want to do, learning something new, being with people with whom you can exchange ideas in a very civilized fashion, being together and getting to know people and sort of meeting them over and over again at classes, taking a hiatus from them at times and them coming back to remake their acquaintance in another class.</p><p>Q. Do many friendships come out of this?</p><p>A. Yes, the community aspect of it is of vital importance. We have special events, such as, perhaps, a field trip to a wildlife preserve, or it may be one to a museum that very few people have heard of. We may organize a theater party. We have had luncheons. There are a variety of things that we plan, and those are fun. It's the exchanging of ideas that is just so wonderful.</p><p>Q. What is your role at this point? Can you let it run on its own?</p><p>A. Would that it were so. I was the first president. I'm now serving my second term.</p><p>Q. Are you stuck with it for life?</p><p>A. No, I'm not stuck with it for life. I think it's very important that we constantly look for new people, new blood, to run the organization. We are at the age where none of us will be around forever, nor is anyone, but more so at our age.</p><p>Q. How many people are typically in a class?</p><p>A. Oh, it varies. Some of our groups are small with 10 or 15; some are with as many as 40 or more.</p><p>Q. What are the most popular kinds of classes?</p><p>A. That also is hard to say. There is a Natural World summer semester class that draws a lot of people. Anything we do in music is always popular. We have 20th-century music or opera, taught by one of us. We have had philosophy classes that have been attended by 60 people. We have had film festivals that are attended by 30 to 55. One of the great things about our program is you need not commit yourself, and many of us travel, live elsewhere part of the year and may miss two or three sessions or maybe half a semester -- no problem, you can always come back and pick up. We're very relaxed.</p><p>Q. No term papers, no tests?</p><p>A. Absolutely not.</p><p>Q. Where would you like to see this program go from here, or is it there already?</p><p>A. This is our fifth year, and we would love to have a fifth year gala of some sort. We haven't quite finalized those plans. I'd like to see it with a firm membership of 200, so that we can expand and provide more courses.</p><p>Q. Where are courses held?</p><p>A. Friday afternoon courses are at Iona. Others are at the Elks Club in New Rochelle.</p><p>Q. What is your relationship with Iona?</p><p>A. Iona is our host. We are completely self-sufficient. We have even in the past offered a scholarship to attend our courses to someone at Iona's Columba school, which is its college for adults. Columba is different than L.I.R.I.C. because it's a college for the returning adult, for continuing education. It gives academic credits. The students are working at the same time, so their classes are late in the afternoon or evening. I want to mention the generosity of the Iona faculty. We often invite them to do lectures or sessions for us, and they're enormously responsive.</p><p>Photo: Lila R. Ogman, head of Learning in Retirement Institute at Iona College in New Rochelle.
