    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="The Dallas owner, Jerry Jones, was on the practice field late last week, speaking to his players about their blocking schemes and talking with his defense. The 2-1 Cowboys have been lethargic in their last two games, and in an attempt to raise their level of play they have resumed  the two-a-day practices that are employed in training camp.    Double sessions in the middle of the season? Basically, it's unheard of. But the Cowboys never settle for mediocrity and Jones, perhaps the most daring owner in the National Football League, never rests. Still, it was something of a surprise to hear Jones confirm what several owners and high-ranking league executives have been saying privately: Jones has actually been considering coaching the Cowboys himself, either next season or not long after that. If he did, Jones would become the first owner/coach in the N.F.L. since the Chicago Bears' George Halas wore both hats more than 50 years ago.  ">

                    <p>''There are just too many coaches who have the experience to get it done better than I could,'' Jones said. ''But there is something in me that would like to coach. I don't back away from that at all. I don't shy away from that. I consider it sometimes, yes. But first and foremost I want to be successful and not selfish, and the best chance for this organization to win is by having a full-time head coach who is qualified, so that's why I probably won't do it.''</p><p>Still, a league executive who has spoken to Jones on the subject said, ''It could definitely happen.''</p><p>''I'm not sure if it will, but don't laugh it off because he has talked about it increasingly the last few months and even the past few weeks,'' said the executive, who insisted on anonymity. ''He probably won't do it, not because he would not be good at it but because he already has so many things going on.''</p><p>Jones, who played college football at Arkansas and ended up a co-captain, said that had he not gone into the oil and gas exploration business, he would have made coaching his career. In addition, people close to Jones say that Jones looks at the nasty divorce with his former coach, Jimmy Johnson, and at the embarrassment caused when his current coach, Barry Switzer, was found with a handgun at an airport -- an incident that damaged Jones's campaign to clean up the Cowboys' image -- and concludes that he might be able to do the job himself without all of the headaches.</p><p>There has always been a sort of split personality with Jones, who turns 55 next month.</p><p>There is the business side, which tells Jones he has so many other responsibilities that he has no time to coach. ''Owner and general manager in the game today is as far as you can extend yourself,'' Jones said, reinforcing that notion.</p><p>But there is the side of Jones that has always gone against the grain. When he took over the Cowboys, he hired Johnson right out of the University of Miami and immediately drew criticism because Johnson had never coached on the pro level. Defying the critics, Jones and Johnson went on to win two Super Bowls.</p><p>To the chagrin of the league, Jones has also cut his own deals with Nike, theorizing that since he paid several hundred million dollars for the Cowboys he should be able to do what he wants with his team.</p><p>''In general, in life, you have to go for it,'' Jones said. ''You live life to the fullest. But I have to admit it would be extremely self-centered if I did coach the team. Still, the desire is sometimes there.''</p><p>Both sides of Jones, according to people close to the owner, have recently been in a state of battle. The more emotional side of Jones wants to coach but the business side, the intellectual side, knows he would be doing it out of selfishness.</p><p>Still, who knows?</p><p>Jones coaching is ''not really an impossible concept,'' said the same league executive. ''Halas did it. Al Davis coaches every week.'' The executive pointed out that the way the Cowboys are currently managed, it is the assistants who run the team, with Switzer stepping in to make decisions on final personnel cuts or whether to go for it on fourth down.</p><p>''No, I don't rule it out; it would not surprise me if he did it and in my opinion if anyone had a shot at doing it successfully, it would be him,'' said one owner. ''People underestimate how smart he is. But why would you want to do it? For him, it's the challenge. He could be the only man in modern sports to win a Super Bowl as a coach, general manager and owner. That intrigues him.''</p><p>And there are no rules in professional football to prevent such a move by Jones. There is one in major league baseball, and it was tested in May 1977 when Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner, in the middle of a double-digit losing streak, sent Manager Dave Bristol on a 10-day scouting trip and took over his duties. He was eventually ordered out of the dugout by Charles Feeney, then the National League president, who cited a rule that a manager or player may not own stock in a team unless the commissioner approves.</p>                </div>
