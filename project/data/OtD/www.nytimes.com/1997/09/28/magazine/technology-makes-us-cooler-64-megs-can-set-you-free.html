    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="More than 25 years have passed since a guy in my freshman English class asked me if I wanted to help blow up a computer center. He approached me after class one fall afternoon and gave me a soul shake for something I'd said about a Vonnegut novel we'd all been discussing -- something about alienation, or maybe it was dehumanization. As we cut across the campus together, a couple of late-to-the-action student-radical types in our jeans and work boots and ratty Shetlands, he got into a long rap about Marshall McLuhan's growing technological pessimism, how McLuhan was saying that ''the electric situation of instant information'' was erasing people's individuality, leaving them empty and scared. Television was McLuhan's chief culprit, but my classmate was looking ahead and seeing nothing but the computer.     He waited until we reached his dorm to mention the bombing plot, then invited me up to his room, where he sketched it out, sort of. A high-school friend of his had an older brother who knew somebody connected to the Weather Underground. The computer center was nearby at the University of Pennsylvania. There was work being done there on the Bomb, or mind control, or something. There was going to be a meeting in Philadelphia soon, though where and when, exactly ... anyway, was I up for it?    ''Wow,'' I recall saying with just the right nuance, getting across (a) that I was hip to the whole technological menace thing and (b) ''No way.'' He then did what everybody I knew did in those days to get beyond an awkward social moment. He put on a record. And picturing him now, absently tucking his hair behind his ears as he hunched over his stereo, I see that I had a glimpse of a coming revolution -- just not the one that he was plotting at the time.    His turntable was state of the art, manufactured by a boutique Cambridge, Mass., outfit called AR, and it rested alongside a high-end, 105-watts-per-channel McIntosh amplifier. The speakers on either side of this setup were the size of night stands, and it turned out that my host had made them himself, determining the right combination and placement of woofers and tweeters only after an extensive consultation of the hi-fi journals. The would-be anti-tech terrorist was an audio freak!     An extreme case, maybe, but the whole 60's counterculture -- the student radicals, the hippies, the human-potential expanders and all their fellow travelers, younger and older -- had its wires crossed about technology. Despite all the dark talk about the new electronic machines dispatching humankind to a drab and fettered future, 60's nonconformists tended to get most loud and hedonistic and free when tethered to a wall socket.     This was a generation that broke with the older lefties and bohos by cheering in '65 when Dylan went electric. This was a generation that couldn't have forged its sense of itself and then announced it to everybody else without stereos and dashboard-mounted eight-tracks, P.A. systems and Woodstock-strength portable generators, wah-wah pedals and FM bands and whole-world-is-watching evening-news broadcasts. This was a generation for whom the latest technology played as large a role as the latest esthetic development or political idea in determining what was new, different, radical -- what was cool.     But the counterculture remained in deep denial about this. Technology wasn't very organic and it cost a fair amount of money and let's not get into that, O.K.? What made the computer such a terrific target was that, unlike stereos and other consumer electronics, it wasn't anything you considered using or imagined you might one day buy -- at least if you happened to be nonconforming, say, on a leafy Main Line campus.     In fact, at the very moment I was being let in on the plan to destroy Penn's computer center (never happened, of course), a company in California called Intel was about to produce the first microprocessor. Soon, in Northern California, a far-reaching revolution would come at the end of hundreds of soldering guns, a lot of them wielded by counterculture types who saw that the point was to liberate the mainframe computer, not blow it up. This revolution eventually enlisted a lot of those 60's youths who took their stereos very seriously. What seems so obvious now should have back then: the future belonged to those who thought that really cool equipment could set you free.    The argument against the computer in the 60's was essentially poetic. The concern was for the soul -- for how your habits of heart and mind might be frazzled by the new machines, and especially for how personal liberty might be sinisterly undermined by the hulking mainframes that were more and more becoming an aspect of everyday life. ''Do Not Fold, Spindle or Mutilate'' was the message on the keypunch cards college students scrambled to secure to get into classes they wanted, and the thing to say as we raced around during registration was, Yeah, what about us?     And everybody saw -- and saw the future in -- ''Alphaville,'' the 1965 Jean-Luc Godard movie that quickly became a campus filmfest and art-house staple. Godard insisted that movies could be a form of cultural criticism, and ''Alphaville'' is a romantic plaint about the coming high-tech dystopia, cleverly disguised as a sendup of Hollywood spy thrillers and cheesy sci-fi. In futuristic Alphaville, people are efficient but affectless, a result somehow of computer programming (that term!) that has robbed them of a language with which to express their emotions. The State runs the computers and oversees, too, an elaborate call-girl ring, what with there being no passion or anything. The film ends movingly -- or maybe, as with so much of the 60's, you had to be there -- with its hero, a tough-guy outsider named Lemme Caution (Eddie Constantine), speeding away from Alphaville (Paris in the middle of the night) and trying to teach one of its soul-numbed citizens (Anna Karina) the word ''love.''     This notion, that machines might deaden the human psyche, was around long before the 60's, of course. It originated with the Romantic poets and was developed by a number of thinkers as the Industrial Age dawned. Among the most important of them was Thomas Carlyle, whose 1829 essay ''Sign of the Times'' was perhaps that era's most powerful articulation of the fear that machines would estrange man from, as he put it, his ''mysterious springs of Love ... and Wonder, of Enthusiasm, Poetry. ...'' Carlyle had his biggest influence in America among Transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau, whom the campus rebels and hippie dropouts were wild about. (Thoreau's aphorism about men becoming the tools of their tools was a kind of 60's mantra.)    But like Jefferson before them, and unlike their European contemporaries, Thoreau and Emerson recognized their pastoral yearnings as elegiac. Change was inevitable because America was about progress, and progress depended on machines. As the cultural historian Leo Marx observed in ''The Machine in the Garden,'' his fascinating study of technology's place in the American literary imagination, Emerson actually hoped his beloved New England would become a manufacturing center, and the most fevered passage in ''Walden'' is a paean to a passing steam locomotive. The American future, these 19th-century counterculturalists saw, would be shaped by shaggy, abrasive nonconformity (i.e., by people like themselves) and, no less crucially, by precision technology.    Those of the 60's generation lived this truth but couldn't get their heads around it, especially when it came to computers. That they didn't know much about them was a big part of it. Sixties rebels were to a great extent artists and social scientists and English majors, and their pronouncements about the evils of the mainframe tended to be vague when not entirely misinformed. There was, early on, the ''Port Huron Statement,'' the manifesto of Students for a Democratic Society, which darkly declared that ''supertechnology'' was ''testing the tenacity of our commitment to ... freedom.'' There were many speeches by radicals denouncing computers on their campuses as immoral, financed as they were by the Department of Defense (true) and directly employed in developing weapons for the war in Southeast Asia (not).     But what there mostly was, I remember, was this recoil from computers as things, big and aloof and droning in their air-conditioned suites. That the one on my campus was in the science building, where my friends and I seldom strayed, and was ministered to by the straightest-looking engineering-department profs, naturally enhanced the impression of cold conformity. Computers were, to put it plainly, completely uncool.   The ''nerds'' who launched the computer revolution in the early 1970's resided in their own sort of Alphaville, or so the story goes. They preferred the company of memory boards to friends, they were uncultured and apolitical, they calculated but seldom felt. But those who transformed the mainframe and, in turn, society could be characterized as unromantic only in the narrowest sense -- they were young guys who didn't make a lot of, you know, space for women. They were, at heart, rebels, and the proof of their profoundly antiestablishment yearnings rests not only in who they were but also in the new, electronic cyberworld they made possible -- a realm that is a haven today not only for the remnants of the 60's counterculture but also for those younger nonconformists seeking some kind of distance from the 90's mainstream.    Like youths all over in the early 70's, those trying to liberate the computer grew their hair and beards, loved rock-and-roll and shared the impulse to raise insubordination to a high principle, there being few acts more noble, in their underground, than stealing costly time on a university's or corporation's mainframe to test a new idea. These earliest hackers, as they came to be called, were in no way members of the New Left -- too much anger and militant discipline in that, and anyway, while they were antiauthoritarian and antibureaucratic (which, practically speaking, meant anti-I.B.M.), they were not anticapitalist. Their politics, broadly speaking, was the genial, improvisational libertarianism that students and hippies and the rest were everywhere living day in, day out, whatever the Marxist or anarchist ideas they might be espousing.    The hackers believed that all information should be shared, free of charge. Hierarchies and red-tape-ism were a burden and a bore. And progress, which is what they were after, was a result not of corporate strategies or Government programs but of playful experimentation and the quest for beauty. What campus radical or 60's denizen of the East Village could argue with that?    Where the computer radicals parted company with the rest of the counterculture was precisely over the role of technology in modern life. They were West Coast kids, for the most part, and many had fathers or neighbors who worked in electronics or aerospace. Growing up, they had rooms of their own in the Virginia Woolf sense -- garages and basements where they were encouraged to mess around with do-it-yourself electronics kits. They had gone on to study engineering or computer science, and they knew their I.B.M.'s and Univacs from the inside out.     Moreover, in college they had virtually no exposure to the ''advanced'' positions in literature and philosophy that informed the arts-and-humanities ranks of the 60's generation. Alienation? The computer kids read Ivan Illich and Bucky Fuller for Big Think and subscribed to Popular Mechanics, not The Partisan Review. They understood what Jefferson and Emerson and the others had about needing both woolly ideas and steely precision tool-making to get to the future.     There were, in the early 70's, hundreds of young engineers, techie grad students, high-school computer freaks and new but restless employees at Hewlett-Packard and National Semiconductor working in basements from San Francisco south to San Jose, trying to come up with something that would do for them what the mainframes were doing for the Establishment. They believed they were soldering toward Utopia. Many of them gathered once a week in Menlo Park, near Stanford, for meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club. There was, by all accounts, a sense of purposefulness and tribal closeness and insurrectionist exhilaration to the club's meetings only dreamed of in most other precincts of the counterculture at that time.    Late in 1974, a company called MITS came up with a mail-order kit for building what, in effect, was the first primitive personal computer, and that is what gave the Homebrewers their sense of purpose and wild utopian possibility. Tinkering with it, going off in some new direction, tinkering some more, they were seeking, as one of their slogans went, to ''Make Every Man a God.'' Through the synergetic sessions of the Homebrew Club, the MITS kit begot Steve Wozniak's Apple II, the forerunner of the Mac, the most totemic piece of counterculture hardware this side of the Fender Stratocaster. As MITS had prepared to ship its first kit, one of its employees suggested that it be called the ''Little Brother.'' The name settled on was the more hi-tech sounding Altair 8800, but that sly reference by the MITS employee to Orwell pretty much says it all about where the computer counterculture was at.   When Ira Magaziner announced several months ago that the Clinton Administration had concluded that the Internet community should be allowed to flourish largely unimpeded by Government interference, the story was framed in the business pages as a victory for the ''industry'' and as representing the transformation of Magaziner from regulation-happy health-care czar to digital free marketeer. But there is, perhaps, another way to interpret the news: that the onetime student radical in Magaziner -- he led the 1969 protests that brought about Brown University's famously open curriculum -- was acknowledging and encouraging the bedrock countercultural ethos of cyberspace.     It was a kind of hot-wiring of Northern California's computer rebels and the remnants of its 60's dropout community that, more than 10 years ago, brought to the Net its essential, counterculture ethos. There was no place else to go by then. By the mid-80's, the manufacture of personal computers was an industry with little room for hackers. The urban boho districts and rural communes and, for that matter, the campuses were not what they once were, either. Cyberspace was a placeless place where you could hide out from the mainstream, even if the networking technology had been designed, in the late 60's, as a cold-war fail-safe system. In the spring of 1985, in Sausalito, Calif., the Well was established with a computer and a rack of modems in the dilapidated offices of the Whole Earth Catalogue, whose publisher, the people-need-new-tools guru Stewart Brand, along with a longtime commune dweller, Matthew McClure, would run the on-line chat room that became the hot template for countless others. The digital equivalents of late-night rap sessions, tribal gatherings and consciousness-raising groups, the chat rooms have kept a 60's-style conversation going, for better and for worse: they're engaged and indulgent, caring and cliquish, provocative and righteous.     The chats, however, are not the only sites that make cyberspace an electric circus. There are the hallucinatory graphics undulating across the World Wide Web, along with the cutting-edge Web zines and the nutty conspiracists, though they tend to be far right these days. And there is, more elusively, the whole happening-strange sense of cyberspace, with its invitation to wander, have an odd encounter and get to someplace new, always new. It has been said that the 60's counterculture's chief legacy is a permanently smoldering insurgency of disaffected young people, and it's the current cohort -- ''alternative,'' whatever -- who increasingly go surf the Web in search of themselves and one another.    The Net is also the closest thing today to a People's Park. It's a place to say anything, and its advocates are hellbent on keeping it that way. Magaziner's policy paper and the Supreme Court's ruling in June that declared the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional are, the on-line advocates say, just the first battles to keep cyberspace a liberated zone. And not all the fights are likely to be with the Government. A vital component of many on-line business models is the ability to capture information about users -- without their necessarily knowing it. What's to stop this information from being sold, resold, distorted? Talk about Big Brother.    Debates about freedom and privacy in cyberspace could well be joined in some form or another by many of those who go on line in search of little more than an improved postal service or 800 number. A counterculture, now as 30 years ago, can start a discussion, however inelegant and adolescent, about the nation's first principles, and the mainstream, at such times, seldom does remain silent.     Worrying about Big Brother, while coming up with new ideas and weird works of art and wild styles of everyday living to get some distance from those who insist on the need for Big Brother -- that's what a counterculture is for, and what being cool pretty much comes down to really. Or virtually.">

A vital component of many on-line business models is the ability to capture information about users -- without their necessarily knowing it. What's to stop this information from being sold, resold, distorted? Talk about Big Brother.    Debates about freedom and privacy in cyberspace could well be joined in some form or another by many of those who go on line in search of little more than an improved postal service or 800 number. A counterculture, now as 30 years ago, can start a discussion, however inelegant and adolescent, about the nation's first principles, and the mainstream, at such times, seldom does remain silent.     Worrying about Big Brother, while coming up with new ideas and weird works of art and wild styles of everyday living to get some distance from those who insist on the need for Big Brother -- that's what a counterculture is for, and what being cool pretty much comes down to really. Or virtually.">

	data-description="More than 25 years have passed since a guy in my freshman English class asked me if I wanted to help blow up a computer center. He approached me after class one fall afternoon and gave me a soul shake for something I'd said about a Vonnegut novel we'd all been discussing -- something about alienation, or maybe it was dehumanization. As we cut across the campus together, a couple of late-to-the-action student-radical types in our jeans and work boots and ratty Shetlands, he got into a long rap about Marshall McLuhan's growing technological pessimism, how McLuhan was saying that ''the electric situation of instant information'' was erasing people's individuality, leaving them empty and scared. Television was McLuhan's chief culprit, but my classmate was looking ahead and seeing nothing but the computer.     He waited until we reached his dorm to mention the bombing plot, then invited me up to his room, where he sketched it out, sort of. A high-school friend of his had an older brother who knew somebody connected to the Weather Underground. The computer center was nearby at the University of Pennsylvania. There was work being done there on the Bomb, or mind control, or something. There was going to be a meeting in Philadelphia soon, though where and when, exactly ... anyway, was I up for it?    ''Wow,'' I recall saying with just the right nuance, getting across (a) that I was hip to the whole technological menace thing and (b) ''No way.'' He then did what everybody I knew did in those days to get beyond an awkward social moment. He put on a record. And picturing him now, absently tucking his hair behind his ears as he hunched over his stereo, I see that I had a glimpse of a coming revolution -- just not the one that he was plotting at the time.    His turntable was state of the art, manufactured by a boutique Cambridge, Mass., outfit called AR, and it rested alongside a high-end, 105-watts-per-channel McIntosh amplifier. The speakers on either side of this setup were the size of night stands, and it turned out that my host had made them himself, determining the right combination and placement of woofers and tweeters only after an extensive consultation of the hi-fi journals. The would-be anti-tech terrorist was an audio freak!     An extreme case, maybe, but the whole 60's counterculture -- the student radicals, the hippies, the human-potential expanders and all their fellow travelers, younger and older -- had its wires crossed about technology. Despite all the dark talk about the new electronic machines dispatching humankind to a drab and fettered future, 60's nonconformists tended to get most loud and hedonistic and free when tethered to a wall socket.     This was a generation that broke with the older lefties and bohos by cheering in '65 when Dylan went electric. This was a generation that couldn't have forged its sense of itself and then announced it to everybody else without stereos and dashboard-mounted eight-tracks, P.A. systems and Woodstock-strength portable generators, wah-wah pedals and FM bands and whole-world-is-watching evening-news broadcasts. This was a generation for whom the latest technology played as large a role as the latest esthetic development or political idea in determining what was new, different, radical -- what was cool.     But the counterculture remained in deep denial about this. Technology wasn't very organic and it cost a fair amount of money and let's not get into that, O.K.? What made the computer such a terrific target was that, unlike stereos and other consumer electronics, it wasn't anything you considered using or imagined you might one day buy -- at least if you happened to be nonconforming, say, on a leafy Main Line campus.     In fact, at the very moment I was being let in on the plan to destroy Penn's computer center (never happened, of course), a company in California called Intel was about to produce the first microprocessor. Soon, in Northern California, a far-reaching revolution would come at the end of hundreds of soldering guns, a lot of them wielded by counterculture types who saw that the point was to liberate the mainframe computer, not blow it up. This revolution eventually enlisted a lot of those 60's youths who took their stereos very seriously. What seems so obvious now should have back then: the future belonged to those who thought that really cool equipment could set you free.    The argument against the computer in the 60's was essentially poetic. The concern was for the soul -- for how your habits of heart and mind might be frazzled by the new machines, and especially for how personal liberty might be sinisterly undermined by the hulking mainframes that were more and more becoming an aspect of everyday life. ''Do Not Fold, Spindle or Mutilate'' was the message on the keypunch cards college students scrambled to secure to get into classes they wanted, and the thing to say as we raced around during registration was, Yeah, what about us?     And everybody saw -- and saw the future in -- ''Alphaville,'' the 1965 Jean-Luc Godard movie that quickly became a campus filmfest and art-house staple. Godard insisted that movies could be a form of cultural criticism, and ''Alphaville'' is a romantic plaint about the coming high-tech dystopia, cleverly disguised as a sendup of Hollywood spy thrillers and cheesy sci-fi. In futuristic Alphaville, people are efficient but affectless, a result somehow of computer programming (that term!) that has robbed them of a language with which to express their emotions. The State runs the computers and oversees, too, an elaborate call-girl ring, what with there being no passion or anything. The film ends movingly -- or maybe, as with so much of the 60's, you had to be there -- with its hero, a tough-guy outsider named Lemme Caution (Eddie Constantine), speeding away from Alphaville (Paris in the middle of the night) and trying to teach one of its soul-numbed citizens (Anna Karina) the word ''love.''     This notion, that machines might deaden the human psyche, was around long before the 60's, of course. It originated with the Romantic poets and was developed by a number of thinkers as the Industrial Age dawned. Among the most important of them was Thomas Carlyle, whose 1829 essay ''Sign of the Times'' was perhaps that era's most powerful articulation of the fear that machines would estrange man from, as he put it, his ''mysterious springs of Love ... and Wonder, of Enthusiasm, Poetry. ...'' Carlyle had his biggest influence in America among Transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau, whom the campus rebels and hippie dropouts were wild about. (Thoreau's aphorism about men becoming the tools of their tools was a kind of 60's mantra.)    But like Jefferson before them, and unlike their European contemporaries, Thoreau and Emerson recognized their pastoral yearnings as elegiac. Change was inevitable because America was about progress, and progress depended on machines. As the cultural historian Leo Marx observed in ''The Machine in the Garden,'' his fascinating study of technology's place in the American literary imagination, Emerson actually hoped his beloved New England would become a manufacturing center, and the most fevered passage in ''Walden'' is a paean to a passing steam locomotive. The American future, these 19th-century counterculturalists saw, would be shaped by shaggy, abrasive nonconformity (i.e., by people like themselves) and, no less crucially, by precision technology.    Those of the 60's generation lived this truth but couldn't get their heads around it, especially when it came to computers. That they didn't know much about them was a big part of it. Sixties rebels were to a great extent artists and social scientists and English majors, and their pronouncements about the evils of the mainframe tended to be vague when not entirely misinformed. There was, early on, the ''Port Huron Statement,'' the manifesto of Students for a Democratic Society, which darkly declared that ''supertechnology'' was ''testing the tenacity of our commitment to ... freedom.'' There were many speeches by radicals denouncing computers on their campuses as immoral, financed as they were by the Department of Defense (true) and directly employed in developing weapons for the war in Southeast Asia (not).     But what there mostly was, I remember, was this recoil from computers as things, big and aloof and droning in their air-conditioned suites. That the one on my campus was in the science building, where my friends and I seldom strayed, and was ministered to by the straightest-looking engineering-department profs, naturally enhanced the impression of cold conformity. Computers were, to put it plainly, completely uncool.   The ''nerds'' who launched the computer revolution in the early 1970's resided in their own sort of Alphaville, or so the story goes. They preferred the company of memory boards to friends, they were uncultured and apolitical, they calculated but seldom felt. But those who transformed the mainframe and, in turn, society could be characterized as unromantic only in the narrowest sense -- they were young guys who didn't make a lot of, you know, space for women. They were, at heart, rebels, and the proof of their profoundly antiestablishment yearnings rests not only in who they were but also in the new, electronic cyberworld they made possible -- a realm that is a haven today not only for the remnants of the 60's counterculture but also for those younger nonconformists seeking some kind of distance from the 90's mainstream.    Like youths all over in the early 70's, those trying to liberate the computer grew their hair and beards, loved rock-and-roll and shared the impulse to raise insubordination to a high principle, there being few acts more noble, in their underground, than stealing costly time on a university's or corporation's mainframe to test a new idea. These earliest hackers, as they came to be called, were in no way members of the New Left -- too much anger and militant discipline in that, and anyway, while they were antiauthoritarian and antibureaucratic (which, practically speaking, meant anti-I.B.M.), they were not anticapitalist. Their politics, broadly speaking, was the genial, improvisational libertarianism that students and hippies and the rest were everywhere living day in, day out, whatever the Marxist or anarchist ideas they might be espousing.    The hackers believed that all information should be shared, free of charge. Hierarchies and red-tape-ism were a burden and a bore. And progress, which is what they were after, was a result not of corporate strategies or Government programs but of playful experimentation and the quest for beauty. What campus radical or 60's denizen of the East Village could argue with that?    Where the computer radicals parted company with the rest of the counterculture was precisely over the role of technology in modern life. They were West Coast kids, for the most part, and many had fathers or neighbors who worked in electronics or aerospace. Growing up, they had rooms of their own in the Virginia Woolf sense -- garages and basements where they were encouraged to mess around with do-it-yourself electronics kits. They had gone on to study engineering or computer science, and they knew their I.B.M.'s and Univacs from the inside out.     Moreover, in college they had virtually no exposure to the ''advanced'' positions in literature and philosophy that informed the arts-and-humanities ranks of the 60's generation. Alienation? The computer kids read Ivan Illich and Bucky Fuller for Big Think and subscribed to Popular Mechanics, not The Partisan Review. They understood what Jefferson and Emerson and the others had about needing both woolly ideas and steely precision tool-making to get to the future.     There were, in the early 70's, hundreds of young engineers, techie grad students, high-school computer freaks and new but restless employees at Hewlett-Packard and National Semiconductor working in basements from San Francisco south to San Jose, trying to come up with something that would do for them what the mainframes were doing for the Establishment. They believed they were soldering toward Utopia. Many of them gathered once a week in Menlo Park, near Stanford, for meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club. There was, by all accounts, a sense of purposefulness and tribal closeness and insurrectionist exhilaration to the club's meetings only dreamed of in most other precincts of the counterculture at that time.    Late in 1974, a company called MITS came up with a mail-order kit for building what, in effect, was the first primitive personal computer, and that is what gave the Homebrewers their sense of purpose and wild utopian possibility. Tinkering with it, going off in some new direction, tinkering some more, they were seeking, as one of their slogans went, to ''Make Every Man a God.'' Through the synergetic sessions of the Homebrew Club, the MITS kit begot Steve Wozniak's Apple II, the forerunner of the Mac, the most totemic piece of counterculture hardware this side of the Fender Stratocaster. As MITS had prepared to ship its first kit, one of its employees suggested that it be called the ''Little Brother.'' The name settled on was the more hi-tech sounding Altair 8800, but that sly reference by the MITS employee to Orwell pretty much says it all about where the computer counterculture was at.   When Ira Magaziner announced several months ago that the Clinton Administration had concluded that the Internet community should be allowed to flourish largely unimpeded by Government interference, the story was framed in the business pages as a victory for the ''industry'' and as representing the transformation of Magaziner from regulation-happy health-care czar to digital free marketeer. But there is, perhaps, another way to interpret the news: that the onetime student radical in Magaziner -- he led the 1969 protests that brought about Brown University's famously open curriculum -- was acknowledging and encouraging the bedrock countercultural ethos of cyberspace.     It was a kind of hot-wiring of Northern California's computer rebels and the remnants of its 60's dropout community that, more than 10 years ago, brought to the Net its essential, counterculture ethos. There was no place else to go by then. By the mid-80's, the manufacture of personal computers was an industry with little room for hackers. The urban boho districts and rural communes and, for that matter, the campuses were not what they once were, either. Cyberspace was a placeless place where you could hide out from the mainstream, even if the networking technology had been designed, in the late 60's, as a cold-war fail-safe system. In the spring of 1985, in Sausalito, Calif., the Well was established with a computer and a rack of modems in the dilapidated offices of the Whole Earth Catalogue, whose publisher, the people-need-new-tools guru Stewart Brand, along with a longtime commune dweller, Matthew McClure, would run the on-line chat room that became the hot template for countless others. The digital equivalents of late-night rap sessions, tribal gatherings and consciousness-raising groups, the chat rooms have kept a 60's-style conversation going, for better and for worse: they're engaged and indulgent, caring and cliquish, provocative and righteous.     The chats, however, are not the only sites that make cyberspace an electric circus. There are the hallucinatory graphics undulating across the World Wide Web, along with the cutting-edge Web zines and the nutty conspiracists, though they tend to be far right these days. And there is, more elusively, the whole happening-strange sense of cyberspace, with its invitation to wander, have an odd encounter and get to someplace new, always new. It has been said that the 60's counterculture's chief legacy is a permanently smoldering insurgency of disaffected young people, and it's the current cohort -- ''alternative,'' whatever -- who increasingly go surf the Web in search of themselves and one another.    The Net is also the closest thing today to a People's Park. It's a place to say anything, and its advocates are hellbent on keeping it that way. Magaziner's policy paper and the Supreme Court's ruling in June that declared the Communications Decency Act unconstitutional are, the on-line advocates say, just the first battles to keep cyberspace a liberated zone. And not all the fights are likely to be with the Government. A vital component of many on-line business models is the ability to capture information about users -- without their necessarily knowing it. What's to stop this information from being sold, resold, distorted? Talk about Big Brother.    Debates about freedom and privacy in cyberspace could well be joined in some form or another by many of those who go on line in search of little more than an improved postal service or 800 number. A counterculture, now as 30 years ago, can start a discussion, however inelegant and adolescent, about the nation's first principles, and the mainstream, at such times, seldom does remain silent.     Worrying about Big Brother, while coming up with new ideas and weird works of art and wild styles of everyday living to get some distance from those who insist on the need for Big Brother -- that's what a counterculture is for, and what being cool pretty much comes down to really. Or virtually."></div>
