For 140 years, the Round Reading Room at the British Library has been a gateway to knowledge and a singular retreat for the tens of thousands of people who have sat at its leather-covered desks and worked under its great Victorian dome, in the center of the British Museum. But on Saturday it is closing for good, crowded out of its premises, and its books and readers are moving across town to a sparklingly efficient new library that will have every modern convenience but will not, it seems, be the same at all.

                    <p>To Virginia Woolf, it was like a domed brain that loomed overhead ''as if one was a thought in the huge bald forehead.'' To Louis MacNeice it was a beehive full of ''stooping haunted readers.'' To Karl Marx, destitute but aflame with radical ideas, it was the refuge that enabled him to produce ''Das Kapital.''</p><p>For 140 years, the Round Reading Room at the British Library has been a gateway to knowledge and a singular retreat for the tens of thousands of people who have sat at its leather-covered desks and worked under its great Victorian dome, in the center of the British Museum. But on Saturday it is closing for good, crowded out of its premises, and its books and readers are moving across town to a sparklingly efficient new library that will have every modern convenience but will not, it seems, be the same at all.</p><p>''It was breathtaking,'' said Michael Drolet, who teaches the history of political ideas at the Royal Holloway College, University of London, describing how it felt to walk into the Reading Room for the first time as a graduate student some 10 years ago. His work has taken him around the world -- to the Library of Congress, the Bibliotheque Nationale  in Paris, the Staatbibliothek in Frankfurt, and the National Library in Ottawa -- and none, he said, can begin to compare.</p><p>''I just find it so inspiring,'' said Mr. Drolet, who is planning a sad, final dinner with a group of reading-room friends at the pub across the street on Saturday night. ''The architecture, the dome, the atmosphere, the way the building breathes.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The move also seems to wipe out in one heavy stroke the long and eccentric history of a place that has been the research home of everyone from Peter Kropotkin, the anarchist, to Mohandas K. Gandhi, the pacifist. It is here that the Victorian poet A. C. Swinburne, overwhelmed by the stifling air or perhaps by the raciness of his own poetry, fainted dead away one day in 1868. It is here that W. B. Yeats compiled his anthologies of Irish fairy tales, that Angus Wilson worked as deputy superintendent, and that George Bernard Shaw was spotted studying an orchestral score of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde.'' It is here that Lenin, wanting to retrace the footsteps of his hero Marx, obtained his own reader's pass in 1902 by using a fake name: Jacob Richter, Ll.D.</p><p>The Round Reading Room was built in 1857 when space in the existing library looked sure to run out. Sir Anthony Panizzi, the library's Keeper of Printed Books, and Sydney Smirke, the British Museum's architect, decided to solve the problem by building a soaring dome, 160 feet high at the apex, over the museum's central courtyard. The dome is supported by 20 cast-iron girders enclosed in concrete; the girders are traced in gold leaf on the sky-blue ceiling.</p><p>As much as the architecture, it is the readers -- 60,000 or so people who possess the coveted passes to the Round Reading Room and the library's other reading rooms across London -- who give the room its rather thrilling character, making regulars feel as if they are part of a community that is greater than themselves. Passes are hard to come by and jealously held: readers must prove that they are working on legitimate research projects and that they cannot get the materials they need anywhere else. Current readers include Margaret Drabble, Mario Vargas Llosa, Lady Antonia Fraser and David Lodge.</p><p>''Everyone is so sad at its closing,'' said Helene Roberts, a former curator at the Fogg Museum in Boston, who was at the library today. ''There's something about that round room, the blue leather and the marvelous, courteous service that's really wonderful. To sit there at those desks and have people bring books to you . . . .''</p><p>Like many longtime readers, Ms. Roberts has mixed feelings about the new library, a huge red-brick structure near St. Pancras Station. The library, which is to open next month, 10 years late and wildly over budget, has already met its fair share of disapproval -- Prince Charles, no lover of modern architecture, called it a ''dim collection of brick sheds groping for significance'' -- and Ms. Roberts worries that it will not begin to replicate the musty appeal of the current spot. ''I realize the necessity of getting new locations and new stack areas, but there's something sad and nostalgic about all this,'' she said.</p><p>Many library officials are thrilled with the new building, in which the current card catalogue -- a series of heavy, dusty volumes in which pasted-in slips of paper give details of each book -- will be replaced by a computerized system. It will have electrical outlets at each desk, for people to plug in their computers, and telephone jacks, which will prove invaluable when the library connects to the Internet.</p><p>Instead of the old pneumatic-tube system by which slips of paper ordering books were sent to attendants in the stacks, books will be ordered using an automatic system run by computer, and a light will go on at the desk of the person requesting the books when the order is ready.</p><p>''The new humanities reading room, which soars up two stories, is inspirational, too,'' said Mike Crump, director of the reader services and collection development for the library. ''And as a provider of services, it's fabulous.''</p><p>But for many longtime readers, and indeed longtime employees, the last week has been a time for reminiscences. Even as the shelves are being stripped of the 12 million books the library holds, readers who have not visited in years have been flocking to see the reading room one last time, sharing stories of the old days.</p><p>Malcolm Bradbury, the critic and novelist, began working in the reading room in the 1950's, when he was researching T. S. Eliot and Eliot himself sponsored his application for a pass. ''That was rather grand,'' he said proudly in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Drolet, the professor, said the reading room was a kind of sub-culture, with its own bizarrely dressed eccentrics who did things like shave at their desks. One well-known would-be Lothario, inspired by the room's reputation as an academic singles bar, constantly tried his pickup lines on new researchers, preferably young and Italian ones. ''He would say, 'Can I show you how to use the catalogue?' '' Mr. Drolet said.</p><p>Audrey Eiffe, 68, a lecturer on the history of fashion who came to take a last photograph of the reading room today, said that she would miss the old card catalogue system, as ungainly as it was. ''They're so heavy and inconvenient and terribly difficult to hold,'' she said fondly.</p><p>Nina Evans, the reading room's last superintendent and now its Readers' Adviser, described how her job ranges from helping solve abstruse research puzzles (''They'll say something like, 'Why did the Bishop of Wells who died in 1721 not leave a will?' '') to gently informing people that they are supposed to be reading, not sleeping. ''I politely wake them up and say, 'Please don't dribble on my books,' '' she said.</p><p>And Scott Lewis, who has been using the library to edit the letters of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning for the past 11 years (14 volumes completed; 26 more to go), described how, feeling wistful on Thursday evening, he stayed at the library until it closed at 9 o'clock.</p><p>''I made a point of staying until the very end,'' he said, rather sadly. ''In its nightclothes, it was really beautiful.''</p><p>Photos: Karl Marx meditated there, his mind on ''Das Kapital.'' So did Virginia Woolf, who said it was like a domed brain looming overhead. But the shelves at the British Library's famed Round Reading Room, which is closing after 140 years, are emptying now as the 12 million books are shifted to a spanking new and efficient library across town.
