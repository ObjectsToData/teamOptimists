    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" THE ARCHITECT OF DESIRE: Beauty and Danger   in the Stanford White Family   By Suzannah Lessard. Delta, $13.95.    The great-granddaughter of one of America's most celebrated architects describes a family life and legacy that were as dark and twisted as White's buildings were elegant and serene. White was not only a hedonist but a sexual predator, she writes; her own father was too, and more, having molested her during her childhood. ''Few writers have ever captured the exquisite, delicate balance of architecture and memory as eloquently,'' Paul Goldberger said here last year.    OTHERWISE: New and Selected Poems   By Jane Kenyon. Graywolf, $16.    The author's life included no small share of suffering: she frequently endured depression and died of leukemia in 1995, when she was only 47. But many of these poems sound an unmistakable note of hope and are a fervent but unsentimental celebration of ordinary things, from centipedes and chickadees to worn nightclothes and baled hay. Earlier this year our reviewer, Carol Muske, wrote, ''Her words, with their quiet, rapt force, their pensiveness and wit, come to us from natural speech, from the Bible and hymns, from which she derived the singular psalmlike music that is hers alone.''     GREAT BOOKS: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau,   Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World   By David Denby. Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $15.     What happens when a middle-aged film critic goes back to his alma mater, Columbia University, and reimmerses himself in the Western canon? He falls in love again -- or, in some cases, for the first time. ''The reader is left with a sense of optimism regarding the future of the humanities,'' Joyce Carol Oates said in these pages in 1996. Literature is also celebrated in A HISTORY OF READING, by Alberto Manguel (Penguin, $14.95), in which the author discusses not only the content of books but also their production, collection, shape and style. One feels ''envious of his passion and grateful,'' Michael Milburn wrote here last year.     GOOD EVENING MR. &amp; MRS. AMERICA,   AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA   By Richard Bausch. Harper Perennial, $13.    This novel traces the sentimental and political education of Walter Marshall, a young idealist in the early 1960's. Hoping to become President, he learns that the road to the White House is rarely paved with good intentions. Its scenes are ''funny and colorful,'' Gary Krist said in the Book Review in 1996.     BRONX PRIMITIVE: Portraits in a Childhood   By Kate Simon. Penguin, $10.95.    Selected as one of the best books of the year in 1982 by the editors of the Book Review, and now back in print, this memoir recalls immigrant Jewish life in New York in the years following World War I. Our reviewer, Helen Yglesias, called it ''a splendid beginning of the wonderful tale of Kaila into Kate Simon.'' A journey is also at the heart of HALF A LIFE, by Jill Ciment (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95). The author's family moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 1964, an event that marked the start of her father's mental deterioration and of her rebellion. This memoir is ''sad, funny and affecting,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times last year.     PARADISE POSTPONED   By John Mortimer. Penguin, $11.95.    The author is known for his Rumpole courtroom mysteries, but this novel, just restored to print, concerns crimes of the heart: why would a left-leaning vicar leave his fortune to an unscrupulous Tory Member of Parliament? ''Mortimer's wry authorial tone steers delicately between sentiment and satire,'' Wendy Lesser said in these pages in 1986.     FOREVER, ERMA: Best-Loved Writing   From America's Favorite Humorist   By Erma Bombeck. Andrews McMeel, $10.95.    She wrote about the domestic moments that have been the stuff of women's lives for centuries, but it's no surprise that she also campaigned for the equal rights amendment. This collection of almost 200 of Bombeck's columns ''is a modest measure of our loss,'' Eden Ross Lipson wrote in the Book Review last year.     A WORLD LOST   By Wendell Berry. Counterpoint, $12.50.    The narrator of this novel, Andy Catlett, looks back on the summer of 1944, when his rakish Uncle Andrew was killed -- not in the war, but in a dispute with another man. ''Berry's economical prose works to great advantage,'' Tobin Harshaw said here in 1996. The same publisher has also reissued Berry's ENTRIES ($12.50), a collection of poems whose subjects range from his Kentucky home to his long marriage to his dying father. ''One appreciates that Berry's writing about aging is not designed to comfort but only to tell the truth,'' one critic wrote in 1994.     THE WINE OF ASTONISHMENT   By Rachel Mackenzie.   Books &amp; Company/Turtle Point, $13.95.    Just restored to print, this novel concerns two sisters, ages 29 and 32 years old, whose sheltered lives end when their widowed mother dies. Both fall in love, with potentially ominous consequences. Set in upstate New York in the 1920's and 30's, this is ''a big little book,'' Martin Levin said here in 1974.   Laurel Graeber">

	data-description=" THE ARCHITECT OF DESIRE: Beauty and Danger   in the Stanford White Family   By Suzannah Lessard. Delta, $13.95.    The great-granddaughter of one of America's most celebrated architects describes a family life and legacy that were as dark and twisted as White's buildings were elegant and serene. White was not only a hedonist but a sexual predator, she writes; her own father was too, and more, having molested her during her childhood. ''Few writers have ever captured the exquisite, delicate balance of architecture and memory as eloquently,'' Paul Goldberger said here last year.    OTHERWISE: New and Selected Poems   By Jane Kenyon. Graywolf, $16.    The author's life included no small share of suffering: she frequently endured depression and died of leukemia in 1995, when she was only 47. But many of these poems sound an unmistakable note of hope and are a fervent but unsentimental celebration of ordinary things, from centipedes and chickadees to worn nightclothes and baled hay. Earlier this year our reviewer, Carol Muske, wrote, ''Her words, with their quiet, rapt force, their pensiveness and wit, come to us from natural speech, from the Bible and hymns, from which she derived the singular psalmlike music that is hers alone.''     GREAT BOOKS: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau,   Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World   By David Denby. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.     What happens when a middle-aged film critic goes back to his alma mater, Columbia University, and reimmerses himself in the Western canon? He falls in love again -- or, in some cases, for the first time. ''The reader is left with a sense of optimism regarding the future of the humanities,'' Joyce Carol Oates said in these pages in 1996. Literature is also celebrated in A HISTORY OF READING, by Alberto Manguel (Penguin, $14.95), in which the author discusses not only the content of books but also their production, collection, shape and style. One feels ''envious of his passion and grateful,'' Michael Milburn wrote here last year.     GOOD EVENING MR. & MRS. AMERICA,   AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA   By Richard Bausch. Harper Perennial, $13.    This novel traces the sentimental and political education of Walter Marshall, a young idealist in the early 1960's. Hoping to become President, he learns that the road to the White House is rarely paved with good intentions. Its scenes are ''funny and colorful,'' Gary Krist said in the Book Review in 1996.     BRONX PRIMITIVE: Portraits in a Childhood   By Kate Simon. Penguin, $10.95.    Selected as one of the best books of the year in 1982 by the editors of the Book Review, and now back in print, this memoir recalls immigrant Jewish life in New York in the years following World War I. Our reviewer, Helen Yglesias, called it ''a splendid beginning of the wonderful tale of Kaila into Kate Simon.'' A journey is also at the heart of HALF A LIFE, by Jill Ciment (Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95). The author's family moved from Montreal to Los Angeles in 1964, an event that marked the start of her father's mental deterioration and of her rebellion. This memoir is ''sad, funny and affecting,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times last year.     PARADISE POSTPONED   By John Mortimer. Penguin, $11.95.    The author is known for his Rumpole courtroom mysteries, but this novel, just restored to print, concerns crimes of the heart: why would a left-leaning vicar leave his fortune to an unscrupulous Tory Member of Parliament? ''Mortimer's wry authorial tone steers delicately between sentiment and satire,'' Wendy Lesser said in these pages in 1986.     FOREVER, ERMA: Best-Loved Writing   From America's Favorite Humorist   By Erma Bombeck. Andrews McMeel, $10.95.    She wrote about the domestic moments that have been the stuff of women's lives for centuries, but it's no surprise that she also campaigned for the equal rights amendment. This collection of almost 200 of Bombeck's columns ''is a modest measure of our loss,'' Eden Ross Lipson wrote in the Book Review last year.     A WORLD LOST   By Wendell Berry. Counterpoint, $12.50.    The narrator of this novel, Andy Catlett, looks back on the summer of 1944, when his rakish Uncle Andrew was killed -- not in the war, but in a dispute with another man. ''Berry's economical prose works to great advantage,'' Tobin Harshaw said here in 1996. The same publisher has also reissued Berry's ENTRIES ($12.50), a collection of poems whose subjects range from his Kentucky home to his long marriage to his dying father. ''One appreciates that Berry's writing about aging is not designed to comfort but only to tell the truth,'' one critic wrote in 1994.     THE WINE OF ASTONISHMENT   By Rachel Mackenzie.   Books & Company/Turtle Point, $13.95.    Just restored to print, this novel concerns two sisters, ages 29 and 32 years old, whose sheltered lives end when their widowed mother dies. Both fall in love, with potentially ominous consequences. Set in upstate New York in the 1920's and 30's, this is ''a big little book,'' Martin Levin said here in 1974.   Laurel Graeber"></div>

Counterpoint, $12.50.</p><p>The narrator of this novel, Andy Catlett, looks back on the summer of 1944, when his rakish Uncle Andrew was killed -- not in the war, but in a dispute with another man. ''Berry's economical prose works to great advantage,'' Tobin Harshaw said here in 1996. The same publisher has also reissued Berry's ENTRIES ($12.50), a collection of poems whose subjects range from his Kentucky home to his long marriage to his dying father. ''One appreciates that Berry's writing about aging is not designed to comfort but only to tell the truth,'' one critic wrote in 1994.</p><p>THE WINE OF ASTONISHMENT</p><p>By Rachel Mackenzie.</p><p>Books &amp; Company/Turtle Point, $13.95.</p><p>Just restored to print, this novel concerns two sisters, ages 29 and 32 years old, whose sheltered lives end when their widowed mother dies. Both fall in love, with potentially ominous consequences. Set in upstate New York in the 1920's and 30's, this is ''a big little book,'' Martin Levin said here in 1974.
