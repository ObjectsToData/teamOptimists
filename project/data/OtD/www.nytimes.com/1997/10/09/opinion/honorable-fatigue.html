    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Jane Alexander, head of the National Endowment for the Arts for the past four years, has decided to give up her career as an arts administrator and return to acting. Who can blame her? She has endured four years of lunches, speeches, meetings, arguments, assurances and compromises, just to make sure that Congress dismantles the N.E.A. only a brick at a time. The theater and Hollywood have nothing worse to offer. Last week a Senate-House conference committee agreed to give the N.E.A. $98 million for fiscal year 1998, a reduction of $1.5 million from 1997 and $78 million since 1992. That is the kind of thing Ms. Alexander has been obliged to call a victory, and in this legislative climate, it is. But as part of the settlement, Congress has granted itself added authority over the distribution of arts money and placed its own representatives on the N.E.A.'s grant-making board. That would sting even if Congress had doubled the Endowment's budget.     That the N.E.A. continues to exist in any meaningful sense at all is a tribute to Ms. Alexander's doggedness and her commitment to the Endowment as a functioning, grant-making institution and not merely a symbol. Under the relentless pressure of conservatives in Congress, the N.E.A. has for the past few years been searching for an insuperable rationale for its existence, the kind of argument that would cause a conservative member of the House to strike his forehead with his fist and shout ''Eureka!'' Social and economic utility is the argument favored at the moment. ''The N.E.A. is a great investment,'' the Endowment posits in a list of ''Ten Facts About the N.E.A.'' It ''helps build community.'' It stimulates local economies.   ">

	data-description="Jane Alexander, head of the National Endowment for the Arts for the past four years, has decided to give up her career as an arts administrator and return to acting. Who can blame her? She has endured four years of lunches, speeches, meetings, arguments, assurances and compromises, just to make sure that Congress dismantles the N.E.A. only a brick at a time. The theater and Hollywood have nothing worse to offer. Last week a Senate-House conference committee agreed to give the N.E.A. $98 million for fiscal year 1998, a reduction of $1.5 million from 1997 and $78 million since 1992. That is the kind of thing Ms. Alexander has been obliged to call a victory, and in this legislative climate, it is. But as part of the settlement, Congress has granted itself added authority over the distribution of arts money and placed its own representatives on the N.E.A.'s grant-making board. That would sting even if Congress had doubled the Endowment's budget.     That the N.E.A. continues to exist in any meaningful sense at all is a tribute to Ms. Alexander's doggedness and her commitment to the Endowment as a functioning, grant-making institution and not merely a symbol. Under the relentless pressure of conservatives in Congress, the N.E.A. has for the past few years been searching for an insuperable rationale for its existence, the kind of argument that would cause a conservative member of the House to strike his forehead with his fist and shout ''Eureka!'' Social and economic utility is the argument favored at the moment. ''The N.E.A. is a great investment,'' the Endowment posits in a list of ''Ten Facts About the N.E.A.'' It ''helps build community.''

Under the relentless pressure of conservatives in Congress, the N.E.A. has for the past few years been searching for an insuperable rationale for its existence, the kind of argument that would cause a conservative member of the House to strike his forehead with his fist and shout ''Eureka!'' Social and economic utility is the argument favored at the moment. ''The N.E.A. is a great investment,'' the Endowment posits in a list of ''Ten Facts About the N.E.A.'' It ''helps build community.'' It stimulates local economies.</p><p>These things are true, but in fact there is only one good argument for the existence of the N.E.A., and it was stated by Congress when the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act was passed in 1965. ''While no government,'' Congress opined, ''can call a great artist or scholar into existence, it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry, but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.'' Significantly, this language, which was part of the N.E.A.'s mission statement as recently as 1995, has disappeared from more recent versions of that document, which say only that the Endowment's mission is ''to foster the excellence, diversity and vitality of the arts in the United States, and to broaden public access to the arts.''</p><p>The era when ''encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry'' was something Congress could legitimately support with hard Federal dollars seems a very long time ago. As a concession of sorts to the N.E.A., the Senate-House conference committee has given it permission to seek private funding, in essence giving the Endowment license to privatize itself. This may work for the national helium reserve, which President Clinton has recently agreed to privatize, but it cannot work for the reserves of thought and imagination -- the foundation of free speech -- whose protection is a public matter.</p>                </div>
