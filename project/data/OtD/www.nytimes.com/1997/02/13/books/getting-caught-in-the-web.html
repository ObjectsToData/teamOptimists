In retrospect his attitude seems odd to him, he writes, because his study of the humanities at Princeton and Oxford cultivated his deep belief in the idea of progress. Still, his fear of being considered a nerd (left over from boarding school), as well as his distrust of technology (inspired by the countercultural 1960's), kept him away from computers.

Like many who grew up computer illiterate, John Seabrook developed a bias against computers, or what he calls in ''Deeper: My Two-Year Odyssey in Cyberspace'' this ''symbol of a mechanized, passionless approach to life that it was a literary person's duty to resist.''     In retrospect his attitude seems odd to him, he writes, because his study of the humanities at Princeton and Oxford cultivated his deep belief in the idea of progress. Still, his fear of being considered a nerd (left over from boarding school), as well as his distrust of technology (inspired by the countercultural 1960's), kept him away from computers. So when a friend introduced him to a Macintosh in 1987, he fell for it hard.  "></div>

                    <p>Like many who grew up computer illiterate, John Seabrook developed a bias against computers, or what he calls in ''Deeper: My Two-Year Odyssey in Cyberspace'' this ''symbol of a mechanized, passionless approach to life that it was a literary person's duty to resist.''</p><p>In retrospect his attitude seems odd to him, he writes, because his study of the humanities at Princeton and Oxford cultivated his deep belief in the idea of progress. Still, his fear of being considered a nerd (left over from boarding school), as well as his distrust of technology (inspired by the countercultural 1960's), kept him away from computers. So when a friend introduced him to a Macintosh in 1987, he fell for it hard.</p><p>As the title of his book, ''Deeper,'' suggests, he kept on falling. Just as he became ''used to the idea that my computer was a typewriter, it changed into a telephone.'' This dropped him into the world of E-mail, where he interviewed Bill Gates of Microsoft for a profile assigned by The New Yorker.</p><p>By E-mail he received his first ''flame,'' an abusive message about his Gates profile from someone who hadn't understood his deadpan humor. Trying to understand ''this most unpleasant experience'' led him onto the frontier of the Internet, where he discovered that users were often painfully outspoken. ''It was a rigorous, sometimes cruel, but usually earnest effort to search out truth and blast away cant and obfuscation without worrying too much how one ought to behave.''</p><p>The talk was also often destructive. Mr. Seabrook discovered Godwin's law, defined by Mike Godwin, on-line counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which stated, ''As an on-line discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.''</p><p>Lurking in chat rooms, Mr. Seabrook also witnessed a lot of sex.  ''Whether what people were doing constituted real sex, or whether it was a kind of phone sex, or whether it was just high-tech masturbation, was an interesting question,'' he writes. ''What a lot of Chat in general, and cybersex in particular, seemed to be about was simply the desire to be on the line -- to take the flow of bits that another user sent you, add your own flow to it and see where it went.''</p><p>Finally, joining an on-line bulletin board, he found members of a virtual community criticizing, or ''thrashing,'' his Gates profile, saying that ''Seabrook doesn't write engagingly enough.'' Painfully, he learned to respond in ''a form of communication that was neither writing nor speech, but writing used as speech, a peculiar in-between kind of expression that I would come to think of as  'speak-acting.' '' After several missteps, he was welcomed to ''the real world.''</p><p>Part of what enabled Mr. Seabrook to travel deeper into cyberspace was the fact that so much more of it was developing. As he writes: ''When I began, in September 1993, the Net was like a field, and in September 1995 the Web was like a state fair that had been set up in the middle of that field. When I logged on, the Net appeared to be an extension of the PC revolution. Now the Web is looking more like the end of the PC revolution, and the start of the next phase.''</p><p>Often enough, he writes engagingly about his travels. His portrait of his mother and her adventures with E-mail is charmingly affectionate.  Despite the flaming he got for being too ingratiating, his deadpan profile amusingly reveals Mr. Gates as ''a very old little boy.''</p><p>And his description of the generic thrashing session is deft. It ends: ''Then the thrash would begin to gutter and quickly die down and deep silence would settle over the jungle again. The antagonists would retire to their separate corners, and the rest of the tribe would go back to grooming one another until the next thrash erupted.''</p><p>But how deep does ''Deeper'' really go? In the beginning Mr. Seabrook felt a ''special lightness of hope and possibility that new communications technologies seem to be uniquely capable of inspiring.'' He hoped to see the democratic vistas that the ''many-to-many'' technology of the Internet promised to reveal. He dreamed of encountering ''groupmind,'' or something like ''the German Romantic idea of the 'Over-Soul,' popularized in England by Coleridge and Carlyle, and then in America by Emerson.'' He prayed that his faith in progress wouldn't be subverted.</p><p>But on his favorite bulletin board,  democracy gave way to what he characterizes as the Yankee players' relations with George Steinbrenner.  Instead of forming a groupmind, people on the Internet found ''a way to be just as cliquish and exclusionary as they ever were.'' As the Web grew more commercialized, Mr. Seabrook wondered if instead of seeing progress he wasn't witnessing the worship of Baal, whom a writer at one site ''linked to the rise of heartlessness, oppression, warmongering and spiritual corruption caused by capitalism.''</p><p>Worse, as Mr. Seabrook writes on about his adventures, his prose becomes increasingly infected with the imprecise garrulousness that writing on computers so often seems to  inspire. In the end, his book is a bit of a letdown. Given what it reveals so entertainingly about cyberspace, he could just as accurately have titled it ''Shallower.''</p><p>Photo: John Seabrook.
