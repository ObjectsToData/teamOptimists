    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, teaching part time on the faculty, there is a young academic who calls herself White Trash Girl. She's a performance artist of sorts: think Roseanne hopped up on post-structuralist theory, Larry Flynt toting an M.F.A. In a faux hillbilly accent, she will tell you all about her fictional identity as ''an inbred biological disaster turned superhero,'' the product of ''a 14-year-old girl and her funny uncle.'' She parades around the blue-collar neighborhood where she lives in tacky resplendence: white cowboy hat, T-shirts bearing slogans like ''I'm baby soft,'' short, tight skirts. She makes White Trash Girl videos and trading cards, and is quick with pronouncements about the provocative importance of her own work, which, as it turns out, has as much to do with whiteness as it does with trashiness.    Laura Kipnis, an associate professor at Northwestern, interviewed White Trash Girl for a recent anthology called, yes, ''White Trash.'' The interview gave White Trash Girl (whose real name is Jennifer Reeder) the opportunity to tell the world why embracing and exploring a white identity was an entirely justifiable pursuit. ''I think a lot of people have this white guilt, so any reference to white culture becomes about white supremacy,'' she said., whereas she sees her whiteness as a fact that should never be ignored and that determines her point of view on just about everything. ''It describes a certain esthetic, but I think it's also a socioeconomic situation, and a way of perceiving the world around you and your own place in the world.'' Reeder revels in white trashery -- and applauds herself for doing so. ''I am busty, and I am loud, and I love bad taste. I am bad taste.''   ">

	data-description="At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, teaching part time on the faculty, there is a young academic who calls herself White Trash Girl. She's a performance artist of sorts: think Roseanne hopped up on post-structuralist theory, Larry Flynt toting an M.F.A. In a faux hillbilly accent, she will tell you all about her fictional identity as ''an inbred biological disaster turned superhero,'' the product of ''a 14-year-old girl and her funny uncle.'' She parades around the blue-collar neighborhood where she lives in tacky resplendence: white cowboy hat, T-shirts bearing slogans like ''I'm baby soft,'' short, tight skirts. She makes White Trash Girl videos and trading cards, and is quick with pronouncements about the provocative importance of her own work, which, as it turns out, has as much to do with whiteness as it does with trashiness.    Laura Kipnis, an associate professor at Northwestern, interviewed White Trash Girl for a recent anthology called, yes, ''White Trash.'' The interview gave White Trash Girl (whose real name is Jennifer Reeder) the opportunity to tell the world why embracing and exploring a white identity was an entirely justifiable pursuit. ''I think a lot of people have this white guilt, so any reference to white culture becomes about white supremacy,'' she said., whereas she sees her whiteness as a fact that should never be ignored and that determines her point of view on just about everything. ''It describes a certain esthetic, but I think it's also a socioeconomic situation, and a way of perceiving the world around you and your own place in the world.'' Reeder revels in white trashery -- and applauds herself for doing so. ''I am busty, and I am loud, and I love bad taste. I am bad taste.''   "></div>

Reeder revels in white trashery -- and applauds herself for doing so. ''I am busty, and I am loud, and I love bad taste. I am bad taste.''</p><p>White Trash Girl represents an extreme -- the far shore where fanzine culture and art-school self-indulgence and identity-chic meet. Yet she is also perfectly representative, the mascot of a new, very hot academic field called whiteness studies. As a discipline in progress, whiteness studies offers many things, but among them is the promise that no groovy young theorist need ever be ''just this white girl'' or ''just this white boy'' again. For in taking as its subject white culture and white privilege, it accords whites the same kind of critical, even obsessive scrutiny that self-defined marginalized groups have long trained on themselves.</p><p>The emergence of whiteness studies has all the hallmarks of cutting-edge research in the humanities today: a casual disdain for liberalism and a romance with political extremes; a fondness for the confessional mode of writing; a serious infatuation with pop culture. The discipline, like a lot of trendy new scholarship, has produced some worthwhile history -- and a lot of silly posing. It is often fractured and incoherent; its central values have unintended and sometimes disturbing implications, and for all of these reasons, it offers a cautionary tale of sorts for life in academia now.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Intellectual trends move quickly on campus, almost as quickly as the pop culture to which they are often responding. And whiteness studies, whatever else it may turn out to be, is the academic trend du jour. Like porn studies a few years ago and queer theory before that, whiteness is furiously generating conferences and panels and dissertations and an entire cottage industry of textbook-style readers like ''Critical White Studies'' (Temple University Press, 1997); anthologies of modish, theory-driven essays like ''Displacing Whiteness'' (Duke University Press, 1997); carefully researched and often-illuminating historical studies of 19th-century America like Noel Ignatiev's ''How the Irish Became White'' and Grace Elizabeth Hale's forthcoming ''Making Whiteness,'' an exploration of how whites in the post-slavery South remade the idea of white superiority.</p><p>There is even, in suburban New Jersey, a Center for the Study of White American Culture, which sponsors talks with titles like ''Turn a Whiter Shade of Pale: The Search for an Alternate Albinity'' and offers diversity consulting and sensitivity training to corporations. It promotes the idea that ''consciousness on the topic of whiteness'' helps ''white Americans participate in building a multiracial society.''</p><p>Contrary to the worst fears of conservative critics, academic courses on whiteness studies -- or porn studies or queer theory, for that matter -- have not yet replaced Beowulf or Chaucer, Austen or Dickens. They have merely taken their place alongside the canonical subjects. Liberal-arts departments today are like bazaars in which a little of everything is available and no one school of thought predominates.</p><p>In any case, nobody really wants to see whiteness honored with a department of its own; the whole idea is too politically sensitive. ''If you got money for something like that, you'd wonder what the donor's motivations were,'' says Annalee Newitz, a Berkeley graduate student who co-edited White Trash'' and spoke at a whiteness-studies conference on campus last May. ''It's so open to misinterpretation and it's so easy to move in the direction of, 'Hey, let's hear it for white culture. Isn't Spam great?' ''</p>                </div>
