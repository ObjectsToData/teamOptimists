Whether it's Russian literature, poetry, ballet, art or pre-Revolutionary dynastic tragedy, Americans can't seem to get enough of the Romanovs. When the Faberge exhibition came to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996, it broke all attendance records for a decorative arts show. This year we have ''Anastasia,'' an animated movie. We have the Romanovs at galleries, in museums, on the auction block and, of all places, at the New York Public Library. After only three weeks, the catalogues have run out for the library's new exhibition ''The Romanovs: Their Empire, Their Books.''    Not that they are ordinary books. They were intended to delight the Czar and his family. The private Romanov libraries held luxurious coronation albums, imperial menus, presentation copies of regimental histories with the ribbon of the Order of St. George in the binding, a provincial town record book with a cover decorated in gold and silver threads. There's even a purple tome commemorating the assassination of Alexander II.  ">

They were intended to delight the Czar and his family. The private Romanov libraries held luxurious coronation albums, imperial menus, presentation copies of regimental histories with the ribbon of the Order of St. George in the binding, a provincial town record book with a cover decorated in gold and silver threads. There's even a purple tome commemorating the assassination of Alexander II.</p><p>There are white imperial borzois  posing for the camera, roses painted by Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in 1914, and a watercolor of a Turk in a fur-lined green coat, baggy blue pants and red shoes, from an album of Ottoman costumes that dates to about 1830. These are books a nobleman could linger over for a long time in the fading light of a cold Russian winter afternoon.</p><p>They are on view through Feb. 28 in the Edna Barnes Salomon Room at the New York Public Library's Center for the Humanities at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Although all 124 items are from the library's collection, the show took years to assemble.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''This exhibition had been in the back of my mind since I came to the library in 1984,'' said Edward Kasinec, chief librarian in the Slavic and Baltic division. ''The library's 3,000 Romanov volumes had been dispersed throughout the library.''</p><p>Mr. Kasinec says the show is the first to take note of the centenary, in 1998, of the library's Slavic and Baltic division, the oldest organized department of its kind in the country, with 387,000 volumes and a favorite resource for such notables as Trotsky, Nabokov and Kerensky.</p><p>The Romanov show is organized by such categories as empire, war, exploration, work and leisure, culture and faith.The only thing missing seems to be late 19th-century novels by luminaries like Tolstoy; perhaps the Romanovs didn't like their point of view.</p><p>Since most of the Romanov men served in military units, there are books celebrating Russia's wars during the Romanovs' 300-year reign, and even a few ceremonial swords that came with the books. Some of the books document fascinating expeditions to the farthest reaches of the empire. Many of the items emphasize the outward appearance of the diverse ethnic groups that made up the vast Russian empire: their colorful dress, ''fierce appearance or peculiar practices,'' said Marc Raeff, co-curator of the exhibition. Writing in Biblion, the Bulletin of the New York Public Library, he adds, ''Little is conveyed about their daily lives, institutions or attitudes toward their Great Russian rulers.''</p><p>Nonetheless, ethnographers will be fascinated by the illustrated 1802 account of Captain Sarychev originally from the Pavlovsk Palace library. One picture from a voyage shows a Siberian Yakut shaman in an animated dance, apparently calling down the spirits to heal his patient.</p><p>Another section of the exhibition explains how the Romanov books, art and jewelry were dispersed after the Russian Revolution. Most books in the library's collection were purchased from the Soviet Government in the 1920's and 30's when it needed hard currency.</p><p>The Government even put the Crown Jewels up for sale. A poignant 1925 photo of the jewels arrayed on a cloth documents how desperate for cash the country's leaders were after the end of the civil war in Russia in 1921.</p><p>A few of these jewels -- or ones like them -- can be seen in a small exhibition, ''Imperial Treasures From the Romanov Family, 1613-1913,'' that A La Vieille Russie gallery (781 Fifth Avenue, at 59th Street in Manhattan) has organized in conjunction with the show at the library.</p><p>In addition to jewelry, Russian icons and works by Faberge, the gallery is showing 30 solid-silver dinner plates owned by the daughter of Nicholas I, Russian drinking glasses with the portrait of Nicholas I and several spectacular porcelain dishes from the rare, circa 1826, Nicholas I coronation service. Each depicts the imperial state eagle, the imperial crown and the chain of the order of St. Andrew. The border shows war trophies and lion heads in gold against a brilliant royal blue ground.</p><p>''The Hermitage has only one of the plates,'' said Peter Schaffer, co-owner of the gallery. ''We have a set.''</p><p>Other Romanov regalia can be seen in Sotheby's auction of ''Russian Works of Art and Objects of Vertu'' in New York on Dec. 5. The sale of 517 items includes a Faberge platinum, sapphire and diamond pendant from about 1910 (estimated to sell for $7,000 to $12,000); a Faberge gold and rock-crystal inkwell, circa 1910, with a gold laurel leaf finial (estimate: $25,000 to $30,000); six white dinner plates painted with sprays of flowers that were made in 1898 and 1900 at the Imperial Porcelain Manufactory for the banquet service of Peterhof Palace (estimate: $2,500 to $3,500), and a milky white Faberge carved agate deerhound from St. Petersburg, circa 1900, that was in the collection of the late William Buchanan, the United States Ambassador to Russia (estimate: $3,000 to $5,000).</p><p>There is even a Romanov memento, a real collectible: the enameled coronation beaker, circa 1896, made for the coronation of Nicholas II and Alexandra, with the two-headed imperial eagle on one side. It is estimate to sell for $1,000 to $1,500.</p><p>The library is presenting a film series on the Romanovs and the Russian Empire on Wednesday afternoons at 2:30 at the Donnell Library Center Auditorium, at 20 West 53rd Street in Manhattan. On Dec. 10, the final day of the series, the film will be Anatole Litvak's ''Anastasia'' (1956), which won Ingrid Bergman an Academy Award for best actress. And unlike the new animated ''Anastasia,'' which dispenses with the Russian Revolution in five minutes, this one can be seen free.</p><p>Photo: Plates from the coronation service of Nicholas I, with the imperial crown, the imperial state eagle and the Chain of the Order of St. Andrew. The porcelain, circa 1826, is at the gallery A La Vieille Russie. (A La Vieille Russie)  </p>                </div>
