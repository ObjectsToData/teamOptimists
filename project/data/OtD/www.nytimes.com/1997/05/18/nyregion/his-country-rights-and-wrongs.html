                    <p>Why has he devoted his life to a pursuit that he himself describes as often ''frustrating,'' not to mention usually unpopular.</p><p>''I don't know if I can give you an answer to that,'' says Mr. Askin, the cerebral lawyer. ''It seems to me to be the appropriate way to live your life. We are all citizens. Of the country. Of the world.''</p><p>But such quests have less to do with the intellect than with the heart. And Frank Askin, who is 65, acknowledges that the ''why'' may be rooted in the experiences of his youth, beginning at age 16, when his older brother returned to their native Baltimore after World War II, a hero tested in combat -- and changed by it.</p><p>Stan Askin, 11 years older, joined the Army before Pearl Harbor and volunteered for the Rangers, a precursor of the Green Berets. In his five years in military service he often fought behind enemy lines and led a platoon at Normandy on D-Day that took heavy casualties. He was wounded twice and awarded two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts. ''I think he saw so much of war and death in Europe he became a pacifist,'' Mr. Askin says.</p><p>Stan returned to Baltimore as an organizer for the 1948 presidential campaign of Henry Wallace. Frank, a senior in high school, joined the Young Progressives of America, of which Stan was state coordinator and which, it came out later, had many Communists as members.</p><p>''The summer of 1948 opened new worlds to me,'' Mr. Askin writes in ''Defending Rights, A Life in Law and Politics'' (Humanities Press, 1997). ''I became caught up with two overriding public issues: the threat of nuclear war and racial segregation. It was the start of the Cold War.''</p><p>Frank Askin, born on Jan. 8, 1932, was the youngest of three sons of Abraham, a saloon keeper, and Rose, a garment worker. Abraham's father immigrated to the United States from Russia after the American Civil War and worked as a milkman. Abraham owned a bottling factory in Baltimore during prohibition and then went into the saloon business.</p><p>Abraham was hostile to his sons' political activities and Rose feared for them, especially during the McCarthy-era Red scare.</p><p>In the summer of 1948, Stan tried to integrate the public tennis courts in a park near their home. The demonstrators, who refused to disperse, were arrested. Convicted of conspiracy to riot, Stan received a two-year suspended sentence. A few years later, he became a radio and television script writer in New York but was later blacklisted and never worked in the field again.</p><p>Frank Askin says he never suffered such ''discernible consequences,'' but his activities in civil rights and union activities got him into the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (He has acquired many of his expurgated files, which he keeps in a thick accordion folder.)</p><p>Mr. Askin said that the Communists he associated with in his youth never committed any illegal acts, other than being members of the party.</p><p>''Their activities involved working for civil rights, working against war, working against McCarthyism,'' he says. ''I never heard of anyone doing any violence or throwing bombs or stealing secrets.''</p><p>When the state of Maryland passed the Ober Act outlawing the Communist Party in the state, Mr. Askin defiantly went to join the party in Baltimore. He was told to come back in a couple of months when he turned 18. He did.</p><p>A few months later, on Jan. 25, 1950, the F.B.I. opened a file on him. ''It's outrageous,'' he says, ''because I was doing nothing. I was exercising rights under the Constitution.''</p><p>As for Stan, he died on Nov. 5, 1993, at age 72 and was given a hero's burial in Arlington National Cemetery with a 21-gun salute.</p><p>In the mid-50's, no longer active in the Communist Party, Frank Askin worked as a reporter for newspapers in Bergen County, including The Record of Hackensack, from which he was dismissed for trying to organize a union. In 1961, the Bergen County Democrats hired him as executive director.</p><p>Thus began a career in Democratic politics, starting with the election of Richard Hughes as governor and including two unsuccessful runs for Congress out of Essex County in 1982 and 1986 and several stints on Capitol Hill as a special counsel to Congressional committees. One, he says with glee,  oversaw the activities of the F.B.I.</p>                </div>
