    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Dead white men, we're constantly told, are on the way out at America's universities, done in by multiculturalism and radical feminists. But the biggest single threat in decades to the future academic standing of America's most august dead white men -- Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, Madison -- turns out not to be a campus plot but a case of what one historian calls ''bipartisan political fecklessness.'' Over the past two years, such unlikely bedfellows as William Bennett, Lynne Cheney and the Clinton Administration have all played leading roles, largely unreported, in threatening to extinguish the Founding Fathers projects: the scholarly effort to document our patriots' lives by collecting and annotating their voluminous papers (18,000 letters by Jefferson alone) in books available to anyone with a library card.     This high-casualty battle of the culture wars began two years ago when Mr. Bennett and Ms. Cheney, both formerly enthusiastic heads of the National Endowment for the Humanities, went to the Hill to recant and argue for the agency's abolition. As card-carrying G.O.P. revolutionaries, they suddenly found that the endowment was (in Mr. Bennett's words) an ''unnecessary, imprudent and inappropriate'' use of Federal funds. Though they didn't succeed in killing the N.E.H. or its sister agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, they helped maim them both. The already small humanities budget was cut by a third, to a measly $110 million.  ">

As card-carrying G.O.P. revolutionaries, they suddenly found that the endowment was (in Mr. Bennett's words) an ''unnecessary, imprudent and inappropriate'' use of Federal funds. Though they didn't succeed in killing the N.E.H. or its sister agency, the National Endowment for the Arts, they helped maim them both. The already small humanities budget was cut by a third, to a measly $110 million.</p><p>Ms. Cheney conceded in her testimony that the N.E.H. had done some good, including the preservation of historical papers -- but in her Leninist zeal to kill the endowment, she told the Congressmen not to worry. ''Private support'' would ride, like Paul Revere, to the rescue. She was wrong. The N.E.H. she left in triage has had to slash its budget for the Founding Fathers projects like everything else. And while some private money has always supported the publication of these documents -- beginning in 1943, when The New York Times gave $200,000 toward the Jefferson papers -- such largesse has declined steeply of late, too. Richard Ekman of the Mellon Foundation, citing the growing demands on philanthropies like his at a time of cutbacks in social services, sees no hope of increases now.</p><p>Along with the N.E.H., which had given up to 40 percent of these projects' budget, and private money (averaging 20 percent), there's a third donor: an affiliate of the National Archives known as the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. Enter the Clinton Administration and its political hackery. In a November meeting whose boorish minutes could have been written by Sinclair Lewis, this commission voted for the first time in its history to demote the Founding Fathers projects in its budget priorities, putting them behind politically opportune block grants to state archival projects. One member, a State Department historian named William Slany, justified his stand by making the self-fulfilling prophecy that interest in the Founding Fathers is bound to ''dwindle.'' The National Archivist himself -- John Carlin, a non-historian (but Clinton campaign supporter) appointed over the loud objections of much of the historical profession -- has gone so far as to say that his top priority is to ''capture the history that is being created today.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Joseph J. Ellis, the author of ''American Sphinx,'' the acclaimed new study of Jefferson, says that until now the Founding Fathers projects had survived by consensus ''through Democrats and Republicans'' and ''ups and downs in the budget'' for half a century. ''If people are more interested in what happens in 1997 with toilet makers in Macon, Ga., then God help us,'' he adds, noting that the founders' papers are ''the closest thing the United States has to the classics.'' Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who has been campaigning to save the projects, points out the bleak irony that those in Washington ''screaming about the lack of interest in history and tradition are leading the fight to deprive people of information about their history and tradition.''</p><p>Mr. Schlesinger's letter seeking Mr. Clinton's intervention brought only a perfunctory non-response; his letter to his fellow historian Newt Gingrich brought no answer at all. If the documenting of Jefferson, Washington and Franklin, already on life support, is soon to cease, we can only hope that our National Archivist will  preserve the papers of today's politicians as assiduously as he promises so that future generations can learn why.</p>                </div>
