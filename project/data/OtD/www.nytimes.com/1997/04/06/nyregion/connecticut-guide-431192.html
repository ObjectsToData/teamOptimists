    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" MARINE ART      ''Wind, Waves and Sail: Marine Art and Artifacts,'' the largest interdisciplinary exhibition undertaken by the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, will open on Saturday in several of the museum's galleries.    More than 50 paintings and prints by Winslow Homer, James E. Buttersworth, Antonio Jacobsen, Fitz Hugh Lane and other artists illustrate two centuries of change in the design of sailing vessels and yachts. They are embellished by photographs and models of some of the more significant ships, and more than 100 marine-related objects. Four sections of the exhibition will cover warships and battle scenes, clipper ships, whaling and fishing vessels, and racing yachts and cruising vessels.    Among the lenders to the exhibit are Mystic Seaport, the United States Naval Academy, the Smith College Museum of Art, the Peabody Essex Museum and 15 yacht clubs in Fairfield and Westchester Counties. Ship models and trophies from the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich will be on display.     Among the special events planned in conjunction with the exhibition is a dinner-lecture series with James Taylor from the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England; Revell Carr from the Mystic Seaport Museum, and Peter Neill from the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.    The exhibition will remain open through July 13, Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $3.50, $2.50 for people 65 and older, and children 5 through 12 years of age. There is no charge on Tuesday.    The museum is just off Exit 3 of Interstate 95. The number for more information is 203-869-0375.     SONTAG AT YALE      Susan Sontag will present a lecture entitled ''The Art of Fiction: A Reading'' on Tuesday at 4:30 in the Whitney Humanities Center, 53 Wall Street on the Yale campus, followed at 8:30 P.M. with an informal conversational session at Ezra Stiles College, 9 Tower Parkway. Both events are open to the public free of charge.     OLD LYME ARTISTS      A collection of paintings by members of Old Lyme's turn-of-the-century artists' colony are preserved in the Florence Griswold Museum, a historic landmark that was then a summer boarding house for the American Impressionists.    Through June 20 the stately yellow and white building will house an exhibition of landscape paintings that depict scenes in a five-acre contiguous parcel that the museum is in the process of acquiring.     The museum, at 96 Lyme Street, is also the headquarters of the Lyme Historical Society and is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $4, $3 for older people and students, free to children under 12. The number is 860-434-5542 for more information.     PETERS AT FAIRFIELD      A concert of light operatic classics will be performed by Roberta Peters next Saturday at 7:30 in the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University. The event is a benefit for the Children's Community Day Care Center. Ms. Peters, of the Metropolitan Opera Company, has in recent years been a musical ambassador to Russia, where she was the first American to receive the Bolshoi Medal, and to China, where she gave recitals and conducted master classes.    Tickets are priced from $25 to $75 and may be reserved by calling 203-254-4242.     ART BY LEAR      Donald Gallup, former curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature at the Beinecke Library, has given the university his collection of the works of Edward Lear. It is housed in the Yale Center for British Art, and until it is formally exhibited in 2000 it may be seen by scholars who must call 203-432-2800 to arrange an appointment.    Lear is more familiar as the author of verses like ''The Owl and The Pussycat'' than for his skill as a painter, illustrator and draftsman. This collection contains 7 oil paintings, 2 oil studies, 362 drawings, 30 prints, 10 autograph letters and additional manuscripts and printed matter.    Among the works are drawings of the Lake District in England from the 1830's, works in oil of Corfu and sites in India, Italy and Egypt, and illustrations for a tract on parrots. His documentations of landscapes  are now considered invaluable.     WEAVERS' ART      A juried exhibition of handwoven rugs, wall hangings, baskets, tapestries, bobbin lace, off-loom weaving and other prime examples of the weavers' art are on view and for sale at the Lyme Art Association in Old Lyme through Saturday.    A special feature of the show, held every other year by the Handweavers Guild of Connecticut, is the work of Helena Hernmark, whose tapestries are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the museum of the Rhode Island School of Design, among others.     Visiting hours are Tuesday through Friday from noon to 4:30 and today and Saturday from 1 to 4:30. Admission is $2 and the number for more information is 203-434-7802.     FORESTS' FUTURE      Scientists, researchers, land planners and forest managers will present their varied perspectives on the future of America's Northeastern forests during a symposium to be held next Saturday from 8 to 5:30 at Connecticut College in New London.    Sponsored by the college's Center for Conservation Biology and Environmental Studies and the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association, the event is open to the public for a fee of $25, including Continental breakfast and lunch. An additional $25 will cover attendance at an evening reception, dinner and keynote address.    Robert Askins, professor of zoology at the college, says ''many new developments, from the introduction of new pathogens to acid raid and new construction projects, will take an enormous toll on our forests.''     The number is 860-4390-5021 for reservation, directions or more information.     BOGART BIOGRAPHY      ''Bogart,'' a new biography of the actor, was written by two authors who never met him. One of them, Eric Lax, will discuss the book today at 2 P.M. at the R. J. Julia bookstore, 768 Post Road in Madison.    Mr. Lax took over the writing of ''Bogart'' after Ann M. Sperber, author of ''Murrow: His Life and Times,'' had spent seven years compiling a massive archive of material. Ms. Sperber died in 1994. Mr. Lax is known for ''Woody Allen,'' a 1991 best-seller.    Also at the bookstore, Sydney Eddison, author of ''The Self-Taught Gardener: Lessons from a Country Garden'' and other books and articles on gardening, will give a talk on Thursday at 7 P.M. for beginners and experienced home gardeners alike. Free reservations are required by calling 203-245-3959.   ELEANOR CHARLES  ">

	data-description=" MARINE ART      ''Wind, Waves and Sail: Marine Art and Artifacts,'' the largest interdisciplinary exhibition undertaken by the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, will open on Saturday in several of the museum's galleries.    More than 50 paintings and prints by Winslow Homer, James E. Buttersworth, Antonio Jacobsen, Fitz Hugh Lane and other artists illustrate two centuries of change in the design of sailing vessels and yachts. They are embellished by photographs and models of some of the more significant ships, and more than 100 marine-related objects. Four sections of the exhibition will cover warships and battle scenes, clipper ships, whaling and fishing vessels, and racing yachts and cruising vessels.    Among the lenders to the exhibit are Mystic Seaport, the United States Naval Academy, the Smith College Museum of Art, the Peabody Essex Museum and 15 yacht clubs in Fairfield and Westchester Counties. Ship models and trophies from the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich will be on display.     Among the special events planned in conjunction with the exhibition is a dinner-lecture series with James Taylor from the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England; Revell Carr from the Mystic Seaport Museum, and Peter Neill from the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.    The exhibition will remain open through July 13, Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $3.50, $2.50 for people 65 and older, and children 5 through 12 years of age. There is no charge on Tuesday.    The museum is just off Exit 3 of Interstate 95. The number for more information is 203-869-0375.     SONTAG AT YALE      Susan Sontag will present a lecture entitled ''The Art of Fiction: A Reading'' on Tuesday at 4:30 in the Whitney Humanities Center, 53 Wall Street on the Yale campus, followed at 8:30 P.M. with an informal conversational session at Ezra Stiles College, 9 Tower Parkway. Both events are open to the public free of charge.     OLD LYME ARTISTS      A collection of paintings by members of Old Lyme's turn-of-the-century artists' colony are preserved in the Florence Griswold Museum, a historic landmark that was then a summer boarding house for the American Impressionists.    Through June 20 the stately yellow and white building will house an exhibition of landscape paintings that depict scenes in a five-acre contiguous parcel that the museum is in the process of acquiring.     The museum, at 96 Lyme Street, is also the headquarters of the Lyme Historical Society and is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $4, $3 for older people and students, free to children under 12. The number is 860-434-5542 for more information.     PETERS AT FAIRFIELD      A concert of light operatic classics will be performed by Roberta Peters next Saturday at 7:30 in the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University. The event is a benefit for the Children's Community Day Care Center. Ms. Peters, of the Metropolitan Opera Company, has in recent years been a musical ambassador to Russia, where she was the first American to receive the Bolshoi Medal, and to China, where she gave recitals and conducted master classes.    Tickets are priced from $25 to $75 and may be reserved by calling 203-254-4242.     ART BY LEAR      Donald Gallup, former curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature at the Beinecke Library, has given the university his collection of the works of Edward Lear. It is housed in the Yale Center for British Art, and until it is formally exhibited in 2000 it may be seen by scholars who must call 203-432-2800 to arrange an appointment.    Lear is more familiar as the author of verses like ''The Owl and The Pussycat'' than for his skill as a painter, illustrator and draftsman. This collection contains 7 oil paintings, 2 oil studies, 362 drawings, 30 prints, 10 autograph letters and additional manuscripts and printed matter.    Among the works are drawings of the Lake District in England from the 1830's, works in oil of Corfu and sites in India, Italy and Egypt, and illustrations for a tract on parrots. His documentations of landscapes  are now considered invaluable.     WEAVERS' ART      A juried exhibition of handwoven rugs, wall hangings, baskets, tapestries, bobbin lace, off-loom weaving and other prime examples of the weavers' art are on view and for sale at the Lyme Art Association in Old Lyme through Saturday.    A special feature of the show, held every other year by the Handweavers Guild of Connecticut, is the work of Helena Hernmark, whose tapestries are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the museum of the Rhode Island School of Design, among others.     Visiting hours are Tuesday through Friday from noon to 4:30 and today and Saturday from 1 to 4:30. Admission is $2 and the number for more information is 203-434-7802.     FORESTS' FUTURE      Scientists, researchers, land planners and forest managers will present their varied perspectives on the future of America's Northeastern forests during a symposium to be held next Saturday from 8 to 5:30 at Connecticut College in New London.    Sponsored by the college's Center for Conservation Biology and Environmental Studies and the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association, the event is open to the public for a fee of $25, including Continental breakfast and lunch. An additional $25 will cover attendance at an evening reception, dinner and keynote address.    Robert Askins, professor of zoology at the college, says ''many new developments, from the introduction of new pathogens to acid raid and new construction projects, will take an enormous toll on our forests.''     The number is 860-4390-5021 for reservation, directions or more information.     BOGART BIOGRAPHY      ''Bogart,'' a new biography of the actor, was written by two authors who never met him. One of them, Eric Lax, will discuss the book today at 2 P.M. at the R. J. Julia bookstore, 768 Post Road in Madison.    Mr. Lax took over the writing of ''Bogart'' after Ann M. Sperber, author of ''Murrow: His Life and Times,'' had spent seven years compiling a massive archive of material. Ms. Sperber died in 1994. Mr. Lax is known for ''Woody Allen,'' a 1991 best-seller.    Also at the bookstore, Sydney Eddison, author of ''The Self-Taught Gardener: Lessons from a Country Garden'' and other books and articles on gardening, will give a talk on Thursday at 7 P.M. for beginners and experienced home gardeners alike. Free reservations are required by calling 203-245-3959.   ELEANOR CHARLES  "></div>
