    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Boston University had long been one of the nation's leaders in helping learning-disabled students through the rigors of higher education. So two years ago, when Jon Westling, the provost, described ''Somnolent Samantha'' in a speech complaining of the extremes to which universities are being pushed to accommodate such students, there was every reason to believe that she was real.     Mr. Westling, now the president of Boston University, related how Samantha had told him after class that she had a learning disability ''in the area of auditory processing'' and would need copies of lecture notes, a seat in front, extra time on exams and a separate room to take them in. And, he said, he was told that Samantha might fall asleep in class so he should fill her in on material she missed while she dozed.  ">

And, he said, he was told that Samantha might fall asleep in class so he should fill her in on material she missed while she dozed.</p><p>Mr. Westling spoke of Samantha on other occasions, too, affirming that the case was real in an interview with The New York Times last year and citing it, again as if it were real, in a letter to the mother of a child with a disability. But now, in documents related to a highly visible lawsuit, Mr. Westling has acknowledged that there was no such student as Somnolent Samantha, that the sleeping young woman was someone he had invented to make a point.</p><p>Even though Samantha is fictional, she and her inventor are at the heart of an academic debate over how much help, and what academic adjustments, learning-disabled college students are entitled to.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Lawyers for Mr. Westling say he is guilty only of daring to voice the politically incorrect view that the field of learning disabilities is still scientifically murky and that universities have the right to set their own academic requirements, even if some disabled students will have trouble fulfilling them.</p><p>But advocates for the learning-disabled say his dismissive words and his actions -- he has tightened the university's policy on handling requests for accommodations -- amount to illegal discrimination against those with learning disabilities.</p><p>In a lawsuit, a class action that goes to trial today in Boston, learning-disabled students at Boston University are charging that the university and Mr. Westling have violated Federal laws requiring that educational institutions provide ''reasonable accommodations'' to those with learning disabilities.</p><p>In the last decade, the number of college students identified as having learning disabilities has grown rapidly. In the annual survey by the American Council on Education last fall, 3.1 percent of full-time college freshmen called themselves learning-disabled, compared with 2.2 percent in 1991, the first year the question was asked. Colleges across the nation are grappling with the question of what they must do to accommodate these students.</p><p>Learning disabilities are defined as the unexpected failure to learn, despite adequate intelligence, motivation and instruction. Reading disorders, or dyslexia, are the most common. But both clinically and legally, the field of learning disabilities is evolving. New learning disabilities are still being identified, and there are no clear legal standards on what constitutes reasonable accommodation.</p><p>For many years, the Office of Learning Disabilities Support Services at Boston University had a national reputation for its summer program for learning-disabled students, the tutoring it offered and its policy of helping such students get special assistance, like the aid of a note-taker, extended time on tests or permission to substitute a course to meet a foreign language or math requirement.</p><p>But in 1995, Mr. Westling, then the provost, became suspicious of the diagnoses some students were declaring, the credentials of some of the experts making the diagnoses and the accommodations the university was being asked to make. After reviewing the files, he said, he was troubled to find poor documentation, vague diagnoses and evaluations that offered no evidence of any need for the accommodations that had been granted. Some files had no documentation or had documentation for the wrong students.</p><p>So Mr. Westling, a humanities professor with no expertise in learning disabilities, changed the policy in this area at the end of 1995, taking unto himself the authority that had rested in the Office of Learning Disabilities Support Services. He made  himself the final arbiter of applications for accommodations, set up a blanket prohibition against course substitutions for foreign language or math requirements and required every learning-disabled student receiving any accommodation to re-apply for such aid by submitting a diagnostic evaluation not more than three years old from a doctor or licensed clinical psychologist.</p><p>The change created turmoil at the learning-disabilities office, where top officials resigned in protest, and led to confusion at other schools that had looked to Boston University as their model. Many of the university's learning-disabled students -- 480 of the university's 29,000 students registered with the learning-disabilities office last year -- said they felt betrayed since they had come to the college because of the support it offered.</p>                </div>
