                    <p>President Clinton has decided to name the actress Jane Alexander to head the National Endowment for the Arts, perhaps as soon as Monday, a White House official said today.</p><p>The decision to appoint Ms. Alexander was reported today by Liz Smith in New York Newsday. The Administration had hoped to announce the appointment next week, during a meeting of the National Council on the Arts, which is the endowment's advisory board, said a Congressional aide familiar with arts issues.</p><p>The chairmanship of the arts endowment, the object of much controversy in recent years, has been vacant since Anne-Imelda Radice resigned in January. The appointment of the 53-year-old Ms. Alexander will bring to an end what has been reported as a deep conflict within the White House between Ms. Alexander's supporters and supporters of Deborah Sale, a longtime friend of President Clinton's who was an aide in his campaign. New Sort of Audition</p><p>Ms. Alexander, who is appearing in "The Sisters Rosensweig" at the Barrymore Theater in Manhattan, said today through the Broadway show's spokesman that she did not want to comment on the appointment until it was made formally by the White House. But the spokesman, Merle Debuskey, said that Ms. Alexander had said to him, referring to the Senate confirmation process she would have to face, "It's the first time I've had to audition in an awfully long time."</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Alexander nomination is "set to go," said the White House official, who asked not to be named. The official added that final background checks were still being made, but that no last-minute problems were expected. "I think she's going to be fine," the official said.</p><p>Although Ms. Alexander is well known as an actress, she has never publicly discussed her views on national arts policy. Mr. Debuskey said that she would not comment in detail on those views until she appeared before the Senate panel that would act on her nomination. He said, however, that she had told him this: "Everyone has a right to an opinion and a right to expression in a lawful manner. I expect to listen and consider all opinions, even those that are in variance with my own." Supported by Pell</p><p>The chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources subcommittee that will consider the nomination, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, has actively supported Ms. Alexander's selection. In March, a number of prominent artists, organized by the New York art dealer Richard Feigen, wrote to the President, urging that Ms. Alexander be chosen for the job.</p><p>Despite the delay in a decision, the selection of Ms. Alexander now comes at a convenient time for her professionally. Mr. Debuskey said she and other principals in the "The Sisters Rosensweig" had already planned to leave the production on Aug. 14, when their contracts are to end. Ms. Alexander is to be succeeded in her role by the actress Michael Learned.</p><p>Unlike previous heads of the arts endowment, Ms. Alexander will start her tenure with a high degree of national recognition, because of her many performances in the theater, in films and on television. Her first big success was in 1967, in "The Great White Hope" on Broadway. In that play, she acted opposite James Earl Jones, who portrayed the boxer Jack Johnson.</p><p>Among her roles has been Eleanor Roosevelt in "Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years," an acclaimed television program in the 1970's. In 1981, she won an Emmy award for the television play "Playing for Time."</p><p>Ms. Alexander's advocates have argued that her distinction as a performing artist would inspire a demoralized constituency of artists and their supporters, and that she would present a difficult target for critics of the endowment. The arts endowment and its sister agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, have in recent years been attacked by members of Congress and other people who question the Federal Government's role in cultural affairs, specifically in awarding grants to artists whose work treats sexual and religious subjects in a controversial way.</p><p>Told today of the impending nomination, Judith Golub, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, an advocate of nonprofit arts organizations, said: "Her acting brings her sensitivity to the arts. She is grounded in it. We can't wait to start working with her. We feel she understands how important the arts are in the many diverse aspects of American life. She'll bring extraordinary vision and leadership that will automatically set her above the factions. She is a consensus builder."</p><p>Ms. Alexander will face divisions. Despite the disputes over controversial grants -- and despite the fact that the agency has a relatively modest budget by Federal standards, $174 million this year -- the chairmanship has been keenly sought because of its influence in the arts community.</p><p>In an interview in March, Ms. Alexander said she felt comfortable in public affairs because she had served on the boards of organizations like the Wildlife Conservation Society (formerly the New York Zoological Society), which runs the New York City zoos; Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament; the American Council for the Arts, and the National Stroke Association. She also said she was familiar with a spectrum of arts institutions across the country, primarily because of her work with theaters ranging from the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles to the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C.</p><p>Her confirmation is not expected to be difficult. Mr. Pell said today: "If the reports are true, I want to congratulate the President on a truly excellent choice. Jane Alexander will be good for the arts across America."</p><p>Representative Sidney Yates, Democrat of Illinois, who is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for the arts and who was an architect of the endowments, said: "I think she would be an excellent choice. I think she will bring a feeling of confidence with her to the post that will augment the prestige of the N.E.A."</p>                </div>
