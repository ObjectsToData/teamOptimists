    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  In early 19th-century America, images of the ancient past were very much at home. Statues of Venus proliferated in Boston parlors. Toile curtains depicting George Washington driving a chariot with a Greek goddess in the back seat were fashionable in Richmond. And mummy mania, spurred by gallery shows of Egyptian exports, swept the land.   In the words of Wendy A. Cooper, curator of decorative arts at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Americans were &quot;mesmerized&quot; by antiquity. From Massachusetts to the Mississippi, the images of classical civilizations were pervasive in 19th-century arts and decoration; aware of their popularity, Ms. Cooper organized &quot;Classical Taste in America, 1800-1840,&quot; an exhibition of 270 items that will run through Sept. 26. She also wrote the catalogue, published by the museum and the Abbeville Press ($34.95 paper and $55 cloth). The show, financed primarily by the Henry Luce Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, will travel to the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, N. C., and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.">

From Massachusetts to the Mississippi, the images of classical civilizations were pervasive in 19th-century arts and decoration; aware of their popularity, Ms. Cooper organized "Classical Taste in America, 1800-1840," an exhibition of 270 items that will run through Sept. 26.

The trickle-down effect went well beyond the Van Rensselaers."</p><p>The most widely circulated items in the exhibition are coins die-stamped with eagles and goddesses. The most fragrant mass-produced piece is a sachet called Palmer's Odoriferous Compound, which was made by a Boston pharmacy; on the back of the sachet is a picture of a giant Roman icon -- the eight-ton marble Warwick vase, brought to Britain in the 18th century.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Americans were so steeped in the culture of the ancients that nobody seems to have questioned some of the more outrageous objects that resulted. One cellarette for storing wine takes the form of a miniature Greek temple; another is in the shape of a Roman sarcophagus resting on the backs of two sphinxes. Even cast-iron parlor stoves, status symbols of the 1830's, reflected the fashion for Classicism. A heater made in Albany is lavishly embellished with Greek urns, columns, griffins and mythological scenes.</p><p>Many pieces are also quite elegant, among them the scroll-back chairs -- known as klismos chairs -- that resemble those on ancient vases. Some were meant for mansions, others for country houses. Among them is a side chair attributed to Duncan Phyfe that is an undulating gem, from its curved back and harp splat to its lion's paw feet. A countrified klismos of ebonized poplar with a sweeping back is equally graceful. The trompe l'oeil painted seat looks as if it is covered with leather secured by gilded upholstery tacks.</p><p>The show's archeologically correct items include a painted bench made in Baltimore with scrolled sides, curved legs and paw feet; it was intended to serve as a window seat. A footstool from New York, with legs carved to look as hairy as a lion's, also suggests an ancient piece, except that in the Roman original that inspired it the mahogany frame of half circles was bronze.</p><p>Most 19th-century metalworkers, however, were devising objects unknown in antiquity, so they allowed their imaginations full rein when adapting excavated artifacts. Since sauceboats were unheard of in ancient Rome and Greece, for example, Anthony Rasch, a German-born Philadelphia silversmith, improvised. He used as many animal motifs as he could to achieve a Classical effect. And it worked. He created a snake-handled vessel with a ram's head spout and feet of winged beasts that is a glorious pastiche. Samuel Kirk, a Baltimore silversmith, devised teapots and coffeepots based on Greek and Roman terra cotta lamps. And Thomas Messenger of Birmingham, England, made a pair of bronze oil lamps with boar's heads copied from the rhytons that hunters of old drank from during feasts.</p><p>The Messenger lamps, produced between 1825 and 1840, are among the many European-made items in the show -- about 20 percent of the total. These objects were brought to America by travelers or imported by merchants in the early 19th century. The lamps on view were owned by the Adams family of Quincy, Mass., who shared the prevailing view that such artifacts were evidence of a cultivated taste.</p><p>Classicism is treated in the exhibition as an international style that saw different expressions, based on region and income level. There are high-style furnishings commissioned by wealthy clients and made by hand, along with mass-produced items of lesser distinction. As the Classical revival style evolved, furnishings became increasingly ponderous and excessively ornate. This development is seen in a sideboard made in Pittsburgh by William Alexander, who seemed not to know when to stop. He combined carved fruit baskets, lotuses, grapevines, scrolls and animal feet with elaborately veneered panels in fan and diamond patterns.</p><p>Some Classical portraits, on the other hand, are sparer in detail and closer to folk art than to formal paintings. Ralph E. W. Earl's oil on mattress ticking of the Ephraim Hubbard Fosters and their five children borders on naivete in its simplicity. The family is depicted in the Classical parlor of its Memphis home, with the toddler, Jane Ellen, taking center stage. She stands on a windowsill in a white dress and pink boots with a plumed plaid turban on her head.</p><p>"These paintings were status symbols for upper middle-class families," Ms. Cooper said. "But they were also their snapshots."</p><p>Photos: An early 19th-century silver sauceboat -- A glorious pastiche.
