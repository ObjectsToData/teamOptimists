The bomb, sent by an anonymous person who the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes is responsible for a string of similar attacks going back to 1978, blinded Dr. Gelernter in one eye, tore off part of his right hand, deafened him in one ear and wounded him in the chest. He has gone through reconstructive surgery four times and attends physical therapy sessions three times a week.">

He has gone through reconstructive surgery four times and attends physical therapy sessions three times a week.</p><p>Today, in a telephone interview from his office at Yale, Dr. Gelernter talked about obstacles to be overcome and the support he had received from his family, friends and colleagues. 'The Biggest Challenge'</p><p>"My outlook is pretty good by and large," said Dr. Gelernter, who has an international reputation for his idea of a future world made possible by blending advanced computer technologies and the study of the humanities. "The biggest challenge was not when I was in the hospital, but more now, trying to reintegrate myself into the world, there are some real difficulties. I'm discouraged from time to time but by and large I'm doing pretty well."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Gelernter told of suffering from bouts of depression since leaving the hospital this summer and described how he faces more surgery, which may help restore both his vision and some functioning of his injured hand.</p><p>He said he had gotten inspiration from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who developed polio when he was two years older than Dr. Gelernter, who is 38.</p><p>"The grace with which he handled that catastrophe is astonishing and has literally been an inspiration to me," Dr. Gelernter said. "He transcended the role of victim, and I hope I can emulate him in that."</p><p>The professor, who is married and has two sons, was injured two days after Charles Epstein, a renowned geneticist and pediatrician at the University of California at San Francisco, lost several fingers on his right hand and suffered a broken arm and severe abdominal injures when he opened a padded brown envelope on June 22 at his home in Tiburon, near San Francisco. 'Doing Remarkably Well'</p><p>Until now, neither man has spoken to reporters about the attacks, and today colleagues of Dr. Epstein said he was traveling out of town. "He's doing remarkably well and he's back at work part time," said a co-worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He is continuing to receive medical therapy."</p><p>Dr. Gelernter said that he had hoped to return to teaching this quarter but that the demands of physical therapy and his continuing recovery forced him to put that off. He is right-handed and has lost the use of that hand. But with the aid of electronic mail, he has been able to take an active role in departmental affairs and in working with graduate students this fall.</p><p>Dr. Gelernter said he had initially coped with the physical and emotional demands of his injuries by throwing himself back in to his work while he was still in the hospital.</p><p>At the time of his injuries, he had almost completed work on a book titled "The Muse and the Machine," about creativity and computers. He has now finished that book, and it will be published by Free Press later this year.</p><p>The book argues for a synthesis of computing and the humanities. Dr. Gelernter is critical of much of the direction of modern artificial intelligence research, which has largely rejected knowledge developed by nonengineering and nonscientific approaches. He believes there are insights in the writings of English Romantic poets, for example, that would have value for the modern study of the inner workings of the mind. Worry Over Intellectual Life</p><p>"The book's thesis has to do with the claim that computer scientists could learn a lot from a field such as poetry that they have completely spurned," he said. "I worry about the drift of the center of intellectual life away from the humanities."</p><p>Law-enforcement officials believe that the bomber, whose targets have mostly been involved with computer science over the past 15 years, is a person who is violently opposed to changes in society brought about by computer technology.</p><p>Both package bombs were mailed the week that the movie "Jurassic Park" opened at theaters. The movie focuses on the impact of two advanced technologies, genetic engineering and parallel computing, and some have speculated that the bomb attacks may be related to it.</p><p>Dr. Gelernter said that he believed he had been picked by the bomber because of ideas about the impact of parallel computing that he developed in an book published in 1991 titled "Mirror Worlds" (Oxford University Press). The book describes a vision of the future in which interconnected computers will permit people to extensively model and simulate the physical and social world.</p><p>He was a pioneer in parallel computing. As a graduate student at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, he invented a simple computer language called Linda that permits programmers to easily break up conventional scientific and engineering problems so that they can by solved in parallel by tens, hundreds or even thousands of processors or separate computers simultaneously greatly speeding computing times. Since then, this approach to problem solving has been widely adopting both by makers of supercomputers and by work station users.</p><p>Dr. Gelernter is now at work on a book on the 1939 World's Fair, which he contends represented a unity between art and technology that has not been seen since.</p><p>"I continue to be intrigued by the relationship between art and technology and by the thought that technology would be deeper and more robust if engineers and scientists had more knowledge about the humanities," he said.</p><p>Photo: "My outlook is pretty good by and large," said Prof. David Gelernter of Yale University, who was seriously injured in June by a letter bomb. His biggest challenge is "trying to reintegrate myself into the world." He sat at his home yesterday with his sons, Daniel, 6, and Joshua, 3.
