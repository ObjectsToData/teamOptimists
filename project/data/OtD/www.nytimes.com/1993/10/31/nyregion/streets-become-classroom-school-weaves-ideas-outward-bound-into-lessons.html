Six weeks into the academic year, the experimental School for the Physical City is open for 131 students in borrowed space, a fledging effort to transform the way that children are taught by using the expeditionary learning principles of Outward Bound. At least once a week the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Ellis Island -- the city itself -- becomes the classroom. Subjects like mathematics, science and history are brought to life and woven into academic lessons.">

                    <p>In a vacant classroom in Chelsea, after the rumble of schoolchildren had faded, five teachers collapsed into chairs and pondered aloud after another grueling day the big question that they all faced: how do you invent a place called school?</p><p>Six weeks into the academic year, the experimental School for the Physical City is open for 131 students in borrowed space, a fledging effort to transform the way that children are taught by using the expeditionary learning principles of Outward Bound. At least once a week the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Ellis Island -- the city itself -- becomes the classroom. Subjects like mathematics, science and history are brought to life and woven into academic lessons.</p><p>But as each day goes by the teachers who gather late in the afternoon are finding that there is much more to the creation of a new school than tacking on a name and opening the doors. Their days, although filled with exhilaration, frustration and signs of fluttery hope, are also a venture in expeditionary teaching.</p><p>"It's a matter of inventing it as we go along," said the principal, Mark Weiss, who manages to smile, partly because he has done this before when he helped create the Bronx Regional High School in 1978. "It's difficult what it takes to incubate a school. You have to start somewhere, and if you didn't push the edges of possibility you might not get started at all."</p>                </div>

                    <p>As the asbestos crisis and the actions of a new Schools Chancellor captured attention at the start of the school year, 31 new secondary schools have opened, a record, quietly conducting business out of the spotlight. Like the others, the School for the Physical City is part of a experiment begun under the former Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, to establish smaller, easier-to-manage schools with student bodies that would ultimately be one-third of the average at the 124 older high schools in the city.</p><p>At the School for the Physical City there are regular textbooks, homework and quizzes. There are the misery-inducing standardized tests and credits required for a diploma, like in any other high school. But the teachers are trying to create a culture that goes beyond the standard fare to elevate achievement.</p><p>The school also tries to build a sense of community. The principal and the nine teachers conduct classes in specific subjects and are assigned to small groups of students called community circles. The groups go on explorations together and meet daily to discuss current events and personal issues. Each day the entire school gathers in a community meeting for five minutes of solitude and reflection.</p><p>The curriculum centers on the infrastructure of the city, and most classes are an hour and a half, instead of the usual 45 minutes. But the schedules are flexible to accommodate the expeditions. All students spend a full day outdoors at least once a week.</p><p>On a bright autumn morning a humanities teacher, Loretta Brady, and her students set out to chase shadows in a project to link math, history and language. With shiny aluminum rulers, tape measures and backpacks, Ms. Brady's charges scrambled onto the A train and then the F to a cracked piece of asphalt on the Lower East Side to measure the height of buildings by observing their shadows.</p><p>The group moved a block away to learn more about proportions and ratios by measuring the shadows cast across the street by a tree and a building. They received a history lesson about the Federal-style buildings in the Henry Street Settlement area. They read a poem about shadows and then wrote a poem on their own.</p><p>"We learn by hooking up to what we already know," said Ms. Brady, 30, an alumna of Brown University who helped start another alternative school, the School for the Future, three years ago. "It seems less frightening. The whole gestalt of it has more impact." Old Wanamaker's Store</p><p>The School for the Physical City occupies six classrooms in Intermediate School 70 on West 17th Street, which also houses the regular neighborhood school and district offices.  The school is to move to its own space in September, the old Wanamaker department store at 770 Broadway, at East Ninth Street in Greenwich Village.</p><p>In the school and the 30 others, with financial support from foundations, cultural institutions, unions, teachers, community groups and public agencies, educators see cause for optimism.</p><p>"It's almost like a Joycean epiphany," Superintendent Anthony J. Alvarado of Community School District 2 said. "You shouldn't look at it without recognizing the potential the larger system has to learn from what is going on here. When you look at them, what you recognize is, 'Holy cow!' Look at all the agencies, the people, the vision, the sense of purpose and expertise that are out in the city that have not been tapped in creative ways to support the human development of students."</p><p>The school is part of a partnership with the Cooper Union Infrastructure Institute; the New York City Mission Society, which is the oldest social-service agency in the city, and Outward Bound, which sponsors 12 schools around the country that use learning expeditions as a central focus. 'We Need a Lot of Work'</p><p>There have been no hair-raising treks into the wilderness, but there was a fistfight between a boy and a girl in the hallway. Some people at the school said the girl was winning.</p>                </div>
