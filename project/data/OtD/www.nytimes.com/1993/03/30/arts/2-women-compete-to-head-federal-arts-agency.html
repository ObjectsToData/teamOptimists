President Clinton, who is expected to announce his choice shortly, is not commenting on the matter, and he may, of course, name a dark horse to the post. But the decision has been stalled, those close to the Administration say, by a sharp division within the White House that involves personal loyalty to Ms. Sale and differing opinions on who would be most effective at the job: a well-known actress or a politically skilled administrator.">

But the decision has been stalled, those close to the Administration say, by a sharp division within the White House that involves personal loyalty to Ms. Sale and differing opinions on who would be most effective at the job: a well-known actress or a politically skilled administrator.</p><p>The endowment chairmanship has been a hot seat in recent years, drawing fire from both those who think the agency's grants have fostered indecency and blasphemy and those who believe them to have been too restrictive. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that the agency's $174 million annual budget is minuscule by Federal standards, the position's visibility and prestige in the arts world has made it a much sought-after prize. The Known and Unknown</p><p>Ms. Alexander, who is portraying a bank executive in Wendy Wasserstein's Broadway play "The Sisters Rosensweig," has never held an administrative or governmental position. But her roles over a 30-year career on the stage and in television and films has kept the 53-year-old actress consistently in the public eye.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In contrast, Ms. Sale, 44, is virtually unknown to the general public but has had wide administrative and political experience beginning with her post as the executive director of the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities during the Jimmy Carter Administration.</p><p>She was also a trusted senior adviser in Mr. Clinton's Presidential campaign; she has known the President since her college days when she met him through the National Student Association. While a student at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn., Ms. Sale was a classmate and close friend of Bruce Lindsey, who is now the White House personnel director. And Mr. Clinton was a good friend of her father, who was postmaster of Piggott, Ark., and prominent in local politics. All of this makes her an O.F.O.B. -- an Old Friend of Bill's -- in good standing.</p><p>Ms. Alexander's supporters argue that her identity as an artist would inspire a long-demoralized constituency of artists and arts lovers and would have the added value of making her relatively immune to attack by conservative members of Congress and religious organizations criticizing the arts endowment for supporting art they deem sexually offensive or blasphemous. Who Could Run an Agency</p><p>Richard L. Feigen, the New York City art dealer, who is managing a letter-writing campaign in behalf of Ms. Alexander, said her lack of administrative experience was unimportant. Her deputies can run the agency, he said. "What's important is her national stature and the fact that she carries the portfolios of the art makers," he added.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Feigen said he had sent four letters in favor of Ms. Alexander's appointment bearing the names of nearly 30 prominent artists, including Norman Mailer, Itzhak Perlman and Peter Martins, to the White House, but has not yet received a reply.</p><p>Ms. Alexander has also marshaled political support from two members of the United States Senate whom she met in the course of crisscrossing the country in her acting career. Senators Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, and David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, are working behind the scenes in behalf of Ms. Alexander. Declining to Discuss Rivalry</p><p>Letters have also been written in support of Ms. Sale, who is the chief of staff to New York Lieut. Gov. Stan N.  Lundine.</p><p>Among those endorsing her are Joan Mondale, the wife of Vice President Walter Mondale who was frequently referred to as Joan of Arts, and Charmaine Jefferson, the executive director of Dance Theater of Harlem. All letter writers have been instructed to send copies of their communications to Ruth Hargraves, a Washington lobbyist and friend of Ms. Sale's, who sees to it that the copies make their way to Mr. Lindsey's desk.</p><p>Ms. Sale, like Ms. Alexander, declined to discuss her rivalry in specific terms, but said that traditionally "persons with star power" have been used by the arts endowment as members of the advisory National Council on the Arts rather than as the head of the Federal agency. "The chairman's job is to run the nuts and bolts, and to provide leadership," Ms. Sale said.</p><p>Ms. Sale's supporters stress her political sophistication as an essential qualification for occupying one of the hottest seats in the Federal bureaucracy. During the Presidential campaign, they said, Ms. Sale traveled with Mr. Clinton for nearly a year, helping to determine at each stop who were the politically powerful people to be dealt with and what were the issues likely to arise. Perils of Overcampaigning</p><p>In an interview on Friday, Ms. Alexander mentioned her work on the boards of the NYZS/Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the New York City zoos, the Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament, the American Council for the Arts and the National Stroke Association as having given her experience in public affairs.</p><p>And she said she had a broad familiarity with arts institutions around the country, a result of her work with such regional theaters as the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the Indiana Repertory in Indianapolis and the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C.</p><p>Both groups of supporters, as well as Ms. Alexander and Ms. Sale, expressed their awareness that too much overt campaigning can be harmful to their cause. They also acknowledged that at the last minute President Clinton might well surprise everyone by naming an unknown, as President George Bush did in 1989 when he chose John E. Frohnmayer for the post. Anne-Imelda Radice, who became the acting head of the endowment after Mr. Frohnmayer was dismissed by President Bush in February 1992, resigned at the close of the Bush Administration.  Chairman for the Other Endowment</p><p>Congressional staff members and others close to the Administration also said that the President had settled on Sheldon Hackney, the president of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, as the chairman for the National Endowment for the Humanities. He would be replacing Lynne V. Cheney, who resigned at the end of the Bush Administration.</p><p>They said, however, that Mr. Clinton was waiting until he could simultaneously name his choices to head the National Endowment for the Arts, the Institute of Museum Services and the Federal Council on the Arts and and the Humanities to balance the appointment of a white male with the appointment of one or more women or minorities.</p><p>Mr. Hackney, 59, is a noted scholar of the Southern United States. His book "Populism to Progressivism in Alabama" (1969) won the Albert J. Bevridge Prize for the best book on American history published that year.</p>                </div>
