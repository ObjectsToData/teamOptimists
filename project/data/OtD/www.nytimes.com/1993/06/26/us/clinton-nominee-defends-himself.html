He was also critical of what he called the other form of political correctness, an attitude he described as "overly solicitous of minority groups and fashionable and trendy concerns."</p><p>And discussing campus speech codes, he said that although civility among diverse groups of students remained critically important to college life, more effective and less restrictive ways of achieving it had to be found.

                    <p>Mr. Hackney contended that conservatives had unfairly and inaccurately described him and his handling of racially tinged conflicts at the university. "I resent bitterly being victimized by slander by slogan," he said.</p><p>The nominee seemed to make a good impression on most of the six senators, a good turnout for a Friday, who were present for his confirmation hearing before the 17-member Labor and Human Resources Committee.</p><p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, chided Mr. Hackney for a "mushy" comment he made in April after black students seized all copies of The Daily Pennsylvanian, the campus newspaper, in protest against the opinions of a conservative columnist. But Mr. Hatch added, "It is going to be impossible to defeat you in the Senate, because you have a way with words."</p><p>Mr. Hackney's conservative critics and some law professors at his university have attacked his response to the newspaper seizure, especially his statement in which he spoke not only of the "overriding importance of freedom of expression to the very purposes of the university" but also of "the pain and anger that many members of the minority community have felt."</p><p>Today he said, "I certainly might have used stronger words in the statement." But he took exception to critics' accusation that no disciplinary action had been taken against the offending students. He said disciplinary proceedings were pending and would be undertaken when the fall term begins.</p><p>Mr. Hackney said the National Endowment for the Humanities, which provides about $150 million a year in grants for academic research, should not be political in its approach. "N.E.H. should not be engaged in either partisan or ideological politics," he said.</p><p>And he assured the committee that he would be prepared to veto grants if he felt they were for projects that taxpayer money should not be spent on. A Different Authority Now</p><p>He said he had a different sort of authority at the University of Pennsylvania. He said he considered the disciplinary charges filed against Eden Jacobowitz, a white student accused of racial harassment last January for calling noisy members of a black sorority "water buffaloes," to have been improper. But he said that the university's judicial code had no role for the president and that he had been limited to urging a quick resolution of the case.</p><p>The case against Mr. Jacobowitz was dismissed last month, when the sorority members decided not to pursue the charges. Mr. Hackney said today that in retrospect he believed that the disciplinary code should have a role for the administration and that the process should be more speedy.</p><p>Mr. Jacobowitz was charged under a university speech code that bars racial slurs when used in face-to-face situations. Mr. Hackney said today that he considered the code, and those like it on campuses elsewhere, a mistake. "It just doesn't work very well," he said.</p><p>Mr. Hackney's opening statement held the attention of the committee as he recounted his Alabama boyhood, his awakening to literature as a teen-ager and his concentration on Southern history. He told of teaching at Princeton and serving as president of Tulane and then Penn.</p><p>"Among the values that I hold dear is a belief that a university ought to be open to all points of view, even if some of those views expressed are personally abhorrent," he said. "I take some pride in having protected the right to speak of diverse controversial figures, from William Shockley at Princeton to Louis Farrakhan at Penn. The university should belong to all its members and not be the exclusive domain of any particular person, group or point of view."</p><p>Dr. Shockley was a physics professor who earned the enmity of many for his philosophy of "retrogressive evolution," which deemed blacks to be genetically inferior to whites and unable to achieve their intellectual level. Mr. Farrakhan is the leader of the Nation of Islam.</p>                </div>
