A few others hooted. Ms. Hansen, unfazed, asked them to divide into groups and make lists of words that came to mind when they thought about the one she had just finished writing. &quot;And don't censor yourself,&quot; she said. &quot;Seriously, we can handle it.&quot;   This was Ms. Hansen's ninth such &quot;peer training&quot; session -- designed to promote tolerance of homosexuals among straight teen-agers and to provide role models for gay ones. Her supervisor, David Nieves, who accompanied her, had led more than 100 peer trainings at other high schools and colleges. There wasn't much they had not seen before: students unwilling to touch the paper on which the words were written; others reduced to shrieks when the lists were read aloud. Ms. Hansen just smiled and copied their replies onto the board.">

                    <p>"No," some students said.</p><p>"Now let's say you were talking about an African-American, or a Latino person, using equivalent terms." She named some. "And you walked into a class like this one, where some African-Americans or Latinos were sitting. What would you do?"</p><p>"Stop," they answered.</p><p>"Right. But let's say you were using some of the words on the board and you walked into a room where a homosexual was sitting. What would you do then?"</p><p>"Stop," they answered, less certainly.</p><p>"Really?" she said. "But how would you know? People assume gay men and lesbians have big light bulbs above their heads. But the truth is" -- she paused -- "we don't."</p><p>The class, as one, gasped and fell silent.</p><p>Not that it should have come as such a surprise. Mr. Nieves had begun the presentation by explaining that he and Ms. Hansen represented the Hetrick-Martin Institute, a nonprofit New York organization dedicated to the special needs of young homosexuals, and that Ms. Hansen was in fact a graduate of its Harvey Milk High School. Still, as Mr. Nieves said later, "kids like this never expect a homeboy like me, or someone who looks like Mary, to be gay." But one other fact about Ms. Hansen might have shocked even a veteran of the gay liberation movement: she is 17 years old.</p><p>Within the gay community, which has often faced accusations of recruitment, the subject of gay youth has long caused anxiety. "The leaders of the national movement have been very afraid to touch youth issues," said Jenie Hall, director of the American Friends Service Committee's Bridges Project, which coordinates the efforts of gay-youth agencies. Even within her own organization, which had supported gay causes for more than a decade, the youth issue was divisive. "Some of the Friends meetings renounced financial support," Ms. Hall said.</p><p>If the liberal Quakers are divided on the subject, the general public has been more openly antagonistic, as was seen in the some of the opposition to the New York City Board of Education's Rainbow Curriculum, which teaches tolerance of nontraditional life styles, including homosexuality. Nevertheless, financed by a patchwork of public and private grants, Hetrick-Martin in Manhattan, the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center and the Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League in Washington -- among 170 such agencies in the United States and Canada -- have been quietly providing everything from hot meals for youths kicked out of their homes to hot lines, pen-pal programs, counseling, companionship and high-school diplomas.</p><p>BUT John P. Hale, a sometime legal adviser to the Archdiocese of New York, objected to these programs. "This is extremely destructive," Mr. Hale said. "In order to give comfort to that 1 out of 100 who may ultimately choose a homosexual life style, they are willing to put at risk the other 99 by encouraging them to experiment in their formative stages of adolescence. If a man in his early 30's invited the neighborhood children over to tell them about their sexual options, parents would call the cops; the school system is just substituting young emissaries for the man next door. I call it proselytizing."</p><p>Responding to Mr. Hale's statement, Frances Kunreuther, executive director of Hetrick-Martin, said: "We are trying to help young people have happy, productive lives. To be accused, still, of something so heinous -- it's disgusting."</p><p>Teresa DeCrescenzo, executive director of Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services in Los Angeles, which runs the country's only licensed long-term residential program for gay and lesbian minors, said: "If you tell me at the age of 13 that you're gay, then you're gay. If you come in 15 months later and you say that was only a phase, that's great, too."</p>                </div>
