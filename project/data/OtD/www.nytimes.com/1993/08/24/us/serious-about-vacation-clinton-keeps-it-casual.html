                    <p>Mr. Clinton carries his own clubs and has been taking along golfing partners from Washington -- Webster L. Hubbell, an Associate Attorney General; Vernon E. Jordan, a prominent lawyer who helped supervise the Clinton transition effort, and Sheldon Hackney, head of the National Endowment for the Humanities -- for his favorite leisure sport.</p><p>Maybe the difference is regional. Mr. Bush, ever the Connecticut Yankee in spite of his efforts to adopt Texas as his home state, raced through outings of golf, speedboating, bonefishing, tennis and jogging.</p><p>For Mr. Clinton, the Arkansas native who has neither the lean physique nor, apparently, the manic sports competitiveness of his predecessor, the pace is decidedly more sedate. He has played golf only twice since he arrived here on Martha's Vineyard last Thursday, and each time, say those who have seen him, in a perfectly ordinary fashion.</p><p>On the course, he has a casual attitude. He is happily willing to take a mulligan -- the extra shot offered among social golfing partners when a first shot goes awry -- with little compunction. Purists might call it cheating when the first shot is not counted; Mr. Clinton's friends call it a generosity of spirit. He encourages others to take mulligans, too. Reading, Eating, Relaxing</p><p>"You've got to get a good shot on the first tee, Vernon," the President said at one point after Mr. Jordan had sent a tee shot behind a tree. Mr. Jordan obliged.</p><p>Aside from an occasional jog, aides said, the President has spent the rest of his time reading, talking, relaxing or going out to dinner.</p><p>Today, he ventured off the grounds of Robert S. McNamara's Oyster Pond home here just long enough for a brief family shopping trip in Vineyard Haven. He, his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea, shopped and shook hands before climbing back into a Chevrolet Suburban for the trip to the second dinner in three days at the summer home of Katharine Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Company.</p><p>As if to remove any temptation to work, Mr. Clinton has no senior aides on this trip and has talked to Washington only occasionally, his press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said. His daily intelligence briefing has become a paper report. He was not told about an incident in Somalia in which six American soldiers were slightly wounded until he awoke, three hours after the national security aide who is with him here received the information.</p><p>"I think he's trying to give his brain a rest," Ms. Myers said.</p><p>It is not that the President cannot be frenetic when he chooses. His Administration is notorious for late nights and cold pizza. And in the weeks leading up to his vacation break, he worked virtually around the clock to win support for his economic legislation. That pace is expected to resume next month when he begins traveling to promote his plans to streamline the Government, overhaul health care and relax trade barriers with Mexico and Canada. An August Without Crises</p><p>For a change, Mr. Clinton could afford to take the break. Unlike recent Presidential Augusts, this month has not presented him with coups in the Soviet Union, disputed Supreme Court nominations or invasions in the Persian Gulf. And the crises that have cropped up on the world stage, in Somalia and Nicaragua, have been mainly problems for other world leaders.</p><p>So as he wanders from hole to hole in a seven-cart motorcade at the Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, the President has looked like a man who was sticking resolutely to his pledge to take a real vacation.</p><p>He chats incessantly about golf -- the green, the wind, the tees -- as he plays. On Saturday, when he hit a ball into the rough, he momentarily lost track of it. When he found it again, it was at the feet of a group of photographers.</p><p>Mr. Clinton was delighted to find it, since a second ball he had hit to make up for the one he thought was lost had landed in a sand trap.</p><p>"This is my ball?" he exclaimed. "I can't believe it!" He then hit the ball to the green with a little too much force. "Stop! Stop! Stop!" he cried as it rolled past the hole. Dressed for Vacation</p><p>But while Mr. Clinton plays golf in an ordinary way, there are constant reminders that he is no longer an ordinary golfer. Last week he played with Jack Nicklaus and former President Gerald R. Ford in Vail, Colo. Here on Martha's Vineyard, hundreds of gawkers lined the road beside the golf course as he played.</p><p>A sure sign that the President is serious about his vacation is his attire. On Thursday he wore salmon-colored chinos to Mr. Jordan's house. No socks. On Saturday he was dressed entirely in purple for his first trip to the golf course and a subsequent visit with Chelsea to a local fair.</p><p>Unlike Barbara Bush, Hillary Rodham Clinton does not play golf, or even try to. Instead, Ms. Myers said, she has been reading and relaxing in private. The family watches videotapes of movies and plays games together, she said.</p><p>How much work has the First Couple done?</p><p>"Almost none," Ms. Myers said. "Actually, none.</p><p>"One of the things I think he misses in the minute-to-minute life in Washington is time to reflect," she added. Waiting for a Glimpse</p><p>The President has been so unexpectedly quiet and low-profile that his absence from the public eye has left the locals, many now wearing Clinton T-shirts, going to great lengths for a glimpse.</p><p>On Sunday evening, by the time the Clintons arrived for dinner at the Black Dog, the Vineyard Haven restaurant, about 100 people were waiting outside, some for as long as two hours.</p><p>Mr. Clinton ate grilled bonito, and Mrs. Clinton had a vegetable plate, according to the restaurant manager. Sticking to his new colorful vacation look, the President wore a raspberry shirt and green windbreaker with jeans and cowboy boots.</p><p>And as they left, they shook every hand.</p><p>Photos: President Clinton watching a less-than-satisfactory golf shot on Saturday with Associate Attorney General Webster L.
