    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  What if they gave a design conference and nobody came? It would not be a great loss to design. The whole field is such a shambles today -- despite annual gatherings in Aspen, Colo., Los Angeles and New York -- that one more conference is not going to put things right. In fact, if people don't show up next month at the International Design Conference at Aspen, the most venerable of the convocations, design might come out ahead. There would be reason to hope that American designers could regain the sense of social mission the Aspen conference once stood for.   In February, the board of the International Design Conference at Aspen voted to go ahead with this year's meeting in spite of Colorado's passage of Amendment 2, the state measure that excludes homosexuals from civil-rights protection. In a written statement, the board expressed its opposition to Amendment 2 but declined to honor the boycott that has been organized to protest it. (In response to that boycott, 24 groups have canceled conventions planned for Colorado.)">

                    <p>What if they gave a design conference and nobody came? It would not be a great loss to design. The whole field is such a shambles today -- despite annual gatherings in Aspen, Colo., Los Angeles and New York -- that one more conference is not going to put things right. In fact, if people don't show up next month at the International Design Conference at Aspen, the most venerable of the convocations, design might come out ahead. There would be reason to hope that American designers could regain the sense of social mission the Aspen conference once stood for.</p><p>In February, the board of the International Design Conference at Aspen voted to go ahead with this year's meeting in spite of Colorado's passage of Amendment 2, the state measure that excludes homosexuals from civil-rights protection. In a written statement, the board expressed its opposition to Amendment 2 but declined to honor the boycott that has been organized to protest it. (In response to that boycott, 24 groups have canceled conventions planned for Colorado.)</p><p>Predictably, the board's decision has angered many architects and designers who regard the boycott as the only nationally organized means to protest Amendment 2. Several scheduled speakers have withdrawn from the conference. The Organization of Lesbian and Gay Architects and Designers, a New York group, is urging design professionals to boycott the conference anyhow.</p><p>The controversy is cause for sadness as well as anger, because for more than four decades the Aspen conference has offered the diverse and fragmented design world the sense of belonging to a community. Brought together for a few days with a mixture of lectures, workshops and entertainment, those who design teapots, ad campaigns and cities gain at least a momentary unity of purpose. This year's conference, titled "Reconstruction Ahead," was conceived to reinforce this professional bond. Instead, the decision to proceed with the conference has shattered it.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Explaining its decision, the board points out that the Aspen conference is not traveling to Aspen -- it resides there. The board also opposes the boycott on principle and says it prefers "proactive" tactics. (The conference is planning panels and a film series on intolerance.) The board's statement includes a comment from Herb Hamsher, a gay activist who lives in Aspen: "We simply must hold ourselves to higher standards of what works and resist the temptation to engage in the impulsive, ultimately destructive actions that have kept society going around in the same vicious cycles from time immemorial."</p><p>If this statement reflects the organization's grasp of history, then what the conference needs most is not a panel on intolerance but a lecture on the futility of conciliation. It could also use a firmer grasp of geography. While the conference facilities and a small support staff are indeed in Aspen, most of the organizers, speakers and conferees live outside the state.</p><p>In fairness, it should be said that the board has an obligation to safeguard the future of an institution with a distinguished past. If Amendment 2 remains in force for 2, 3 or 10 years, a decision to join the boycott could permanently pull the plug on the association. So what about the board's duty to speak out on behalf of the design community it serves? To say: No, we do not pump money into a system of legalized discrimination.</p><p>Tibor Kalman, who heads the New York design firm M &amp; Co., said in an interview that "this whole thing is about hotel reservation deposits. Who wants to have to refund all those hotel deposits?" That's putting it a bit bluntly. The hotel deposit is, however, an apt metaphor for what is wrong with the Aspen conference -- and the design field in general. Aspen once stood for the idea that design could change the world around it. Today, design is a kind of esthetic tourism, a slick, packaged glide over the surface of things.</p><p>Even since the collapse of the industrial "Good Design" esthetic that the Aspen conference was established to promote, design has been gallivanting like a day tripper through time and space, pausing here to soak up an hour of the Mediterranean Look, stopping there for a minute of Biedermeier. It's been a fabulous junket, but what it adds up to is an itinerary of escapism: Instead of providing tools to transform the world, design just passes through it. No wonder the design group thinks that civil rights can be fitted in somewhere between hot-air ballooning and a boxed lunch al fresco. In an era that confuses design with fleeting images, even social responsibility can be reduced to graphics: the knit brow, the wet eye, the heart on the sleeve, the red ribbon on the lapel.</p><p>Tourism is not a new story at Aspen. Walter Paepke, the industrialist who founded the Aspen Institute for the Humanities and the design conference that grew out of it, wanted to create "an American Salzburg," a retreat where art and music could be savored in a setting of natural splendor.</p><p>The conference's original goals were pioneering, not touristic. Paepke, who had helped Bauhaus designers when they fled Nazi Germany, took up the Bauhaus crusade to fuse art and industry. The conference, first held in 1951, brought together designers and industrialists in the belief that design could lift America's postwar material prosperity to a higher cultural plateau.</p><p>Over the years, a vacation sensibility displaced Aspen's missionary idealism, just as tourism took over the town itself. With whole programs devoted to design from Italy, Japan and other hot spots on the design map, the conference came to resemble a suitcase slathered with souvenir stickers. It has been years since anyone looked to Aspen to set an agenda for design. Instead, the conference seems to serve design by providing designers with a brief Rocky Mountain High.</p><p>In the past two years, conference themes have taken a more serious turn. Yet a theme like this year's "Reconstruction Ahead" is only following the crowds. For too long, the conference has been content to reflect the times instead of reform them. And its lame response to Amendment 2 continues the pattern. Clearly, a liberal town like Aspen needs no sermons on intolerance, and in any case the conference has compromised its ability to address the issue objectively, having already decided that boycotts don't work.</p><p>It could be argued that you can't look to design for solutions to ethical problems, because design is itself an ethical problem -- that the rise of the design profession is part of a historical shift from substance to appearance that has left the culture in moral disarray. Actually, you can accomplish good things with appearances. As three conference speakers wrote announcing their withdrawal, "Symbols are important here."</p><p>A boycott is indeed a symbol. But a boycott is also tangible. It affects the environment. So, ideally, does design. And that's what's doubly sad about the decision to oppose the amendment and ignore the boycott. In failing to match symbol with substance, the Aspen conference has not only trivialized a major social issue, it has revealed a shallow conception of design.</p><p>Photo: A condominium development in Aspen -- Both the community and the field of design in general seem to be on vacation.
