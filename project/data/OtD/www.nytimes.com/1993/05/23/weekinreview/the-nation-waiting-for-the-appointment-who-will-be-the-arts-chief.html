                    <p>PEOPLE in the arts know that President Clinton has had his hands full lately with Bosnia, gays in the military and the tax bill, but last week the National Council on the Arts could contain its frustration no longer about the Administration's foot-dragging on the chief appointment for the National Endowment for the Arts.</p><p>The council members, all of whom were appointed during the last two Administrations and who advise the arts endowment chairman, unanimously adopted a resolution informing the Administration how "disturbed" it was that a chairman had not yet been named. The chairman oversees the allocation of $175 million to artists and art institutions.</p><p>"Inaction sends the wrong signal," said Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who proposed the resolution. The Administration has not yet replied, he said.</p><p>One well-connected arts administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, speculated about the reason for delay. With all the problems President Clinton is facing, this person said, he has no desire at the moment to appoint a chairman for the arts endowment when he knows that a nominee, regardless of credentials, would come under fire both from those who think the endowment has promoted obscenity and sacrilege and from those who believe it has been cowed by shrill attacks from conservatives and now stifles free expression. Appointing a new chairman for the arts endowment now, said the administrator, would be a great way to throw away votes for, say, homosexuals in the military.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A White House staff member who also spoke on condition of anonymity was more reassuring: "I know you've heard this before," the aide said, "but we're close to a decision -- perhaps next week."</p><p>In a move that alarmed many artists and arts administrators, the Department of Justice last month appealed the decision of a Federal judge in Los Angeles that had declared unconstitutional the so-called decency standard which required the arts endowment to "take into consideration general standards of decency" when awarding grants.</p><p>The decency standard was written into law three years ago by Congress as part of a compromise that terminated a long, scratchy debate over the future of the arts endowment, which had been prompted by the Federal agency's sponsorship of shows displaying works by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. The decency standard mollified conservatives but outraged many liberals who thought it amounted to censorship. A White House staff member said the Justice Department was prompted to act only because of a legal technicality, not from any commitment to the standard.  Artists Challenge Decency Standard</p><p>The constitutionality of the statute had been challenged by four performance artists who asserted that their arts endowment grants had been canceled on grounds of indecency.</p><p>Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a public policy group, said she is so angered by the Administration's support for the decency standard that she hopes whoever is offered the arts endowment chairmanship will publicly decline the offer.</p><p>Underlying these frustrations is the fact that President Clinton has yet to spell out his Administration's policy on the arts. That could not possibly put an end to every quarrel over whether a specific work of art is beyond the pale for Federal subsidy, but it could rally a demoralized constituency and provide footing for Mr. Clinton's eventual choice to head the arts endowment. A policy statement could also guide the debate on reauthorization of the endowment in September.</p><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to arts policy, previous Administrations do not offer much guidance. In fact, for at least 60 years, arts administrators say, Federal arts policy has been a hasty improvisation, dodging the tough issues and frequently doing the right thing for what many consider to be the wrong reason.</p><p>Under the New Deal in the early 1930's, artists were hired by the Government simply to reduce the number of unemployed. In the early days of the cold war, the rationale for supporting artists through cultural exchanges was for America to outshine the Communists.</p><p>Put to such use, artists were expected to entertain, and the notion that they might provoke or even shock was officially discouraged. This attitude was typified by President Harry S. Truman when he attended an art exhibit arranged by the State Department and stopped in front of a painting of a circus performer with exaggerated features. "If that's art," President Truman remarked, "I'm a Hottentot!"</p><p>During the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, the goal of promoting "excellence" was put forward as a more sophisticated rationale for Federal subsidy. When Congress created the arts and humanities endowments in 1965, their purpose was stated as the pursuit of "artistic and humanistic excellence."</p><p>Yet, to excel is to do better than others, suggesting a competitive rather than a creative accomplishment. Consciously or not, the quest for excellence was a further extension of cold war rivalry.</p><p>In the Administration of Richard M. Nixon, the budget for the arts endowment, which was $8 million in 1969, climbed to a princely $75 million five years later. According to aides, Mr. Nixon believed that the country's artists and intellectuals might soften their opposition to the war in Vietnam if flushed with Federal money.</p><p>During the 1980's, the economic impact of the arts was rediscovered.  A study showed that cultural activities attracted $5.6 billion to the New York-New Jersey area. The study was used to encourage governments, corporations and other donors to support the arts as a matter of enlightened self-interest.</p><p>In recent years, the cry has been that the arts are entitled to Federal dollars because they "advance civilization," providing uplift and affirmation. But this notion is based on a false, sanitized concept of the arts, inconsistent with the confrontational styles that play a large part in today's art scene.</p><p>The challenge before Mr. Clinton, then, is to explain why the Government should support this often screechingly provocative expression.</p><p>Given his current problems, Mr. Clinton may deem it politically expedient to repeat the old cliches, half-truths and obfuscations.</p><p>On the other hand, he could do worse than argue that the arts, like health and education, are a social good and, even if sometimes painful, they deserve to be fostered by the Federal Government.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
