More to the point, what is the point of combining big-time sports and higher education? I don't believe they have anything in common. I happen to think a lot of people believe the same thing, but they are stuck with a system that makes them pompously intone phrases like &quot;student-athlete&quot; about guys who are taking vocational training for the Green Bay Packers or the Phoenix Suns.

We're all stuck with this monster, the monster that brought down Dick Schultz.</p><p>Dick Schultz is a lay preacher who can talk about standards and reform and make you believe in them. But yesterday Dick Schultz resigned as executive director of the National Collegiate Athletic Association because abuses were judged to have taken place under his watch at the University of Virginia, 10 to 12 years ago. Makes you wonder.</p><p>This is not like the matter of Robert Helmick, who resigned under pressure for exploiting his role as the head of the United States Olympic Committee. This is not a coach like Barry Switzer of Oklahoma or Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada-Las Vegas, who left when the muck reached their waists. This is technical stuff that Schultz should have known, or did know. It's all over the map.</p>                </div>

                    <p>If grubby practices involving money for athletes can drag down Schultz, what athletic director at a powerhouse university does not have some scandal ticking away? Isn't there something inherently wrong with a system that shoehorns marginal students into expensive schools and then asks them to live like paupers or risk breaking the rules?</p><p>The abuses at Virginia, 13 in all, involved improper interest-free loans for athletes and graduate assistant coaches. Under the artificial rules of the N.C.A.A., these people are forced to live in abject poverty while the head coaches take down fortunes.</p><p>Dick Schultz walks the plank for $50 loans that he may or may not have known about. But Mike Krzyzewski, the basketball coach at Duke, is taking something like $6 million over the next 15 years for endorsing Nike products, and it is perfectly legal. There is tons of money in college sports, but heaven forbid that the athletes should touch any of it.</p><p>Because of the high costs of big-time sports, it is virtually inevitable that every school will have volunteers or boosters or friends trying to "help." The role of the athletic director is to look straight ahead and stick his fingers in his ears.</p><p>Schultz probably did as well as any athletic director in controlling or ignoring the little dodges in channeling bucks to athletes. But after his old school was put on a two-year probation last Thursday, Schultz waited five days and yesterday he resigned, not without considerable sympathy.</p><p>"I believe Dick is caught here in a heartening elevation of standards of leadership," said Claire Gaudiani, the president of Connecticut College and a member of the the executive committee of N.C.A.A. Presidents' Commission. "Any shadows on his past, he felt, had to be examined. I don't believe it is in Dick's nature to leave the N.C.A.A. in this shadow."</p><p>That is less than a ringing endorsement for Schultz to stay on and fight the swarm of gnatlike charges.</p><p>Gaudiani said: "These were not major abuses, and as Dick said, most people can't remember what happened six weeks ago, much less 10 or 12 years ago. People find Dick to be an outstanding person. That doesn't mean inappropriate things did not happen."</p><p>Well now. If Schultz was indeed tripped up by events at his old school, is there any hope for the system? Gaudiani makes the point that she is hardly anti-athletic. She played linebacker on a two-hand-touch team at the National Humanities Center, once scoring a touchdown for the wrong team, "which was a chastening experience." She loves watching the men cheering the female athletes, and vice versa, at the 2,000-student Division III school.</p><p>Gaudiani says she doesn't want to tear it all apart, and would rather focus on making things better. She talks of gender equity under Title IX "but not at the expense of men's sports." She talks about a frightening study that suggests athletes lag behind other students in "ethics and moral reasoning."</p><p>These were things Dick Schultz talked about. He never sounded like an apologist for a system that sneaked athletes into school and paid them surreptitiously. But that system brought down Dick Schultz. Makes you wonder.</p><p>Photo: Dick Schultz (Associated Press)</p>                </div>
