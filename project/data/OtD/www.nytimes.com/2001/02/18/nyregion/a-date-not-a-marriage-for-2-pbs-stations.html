Cass, the president and general manager of Channel 21, insist that their plans are better described as an affiliation than a merger.</p><p>The need to comply with a federal mandate to end analog transmissions and convert to digital technology has given impetus to the talks.  Like most of the 350 public television stations in the country, Channel 21 has yet to make the conversion.  Channel 13 has, to the tune of $35 million, but it is one of only 23 public stations that have done so.</p><p>''Anywhere we can combine our resources, we should,'' Dr. Baker said. ''Anywhere we can avoid competition, we should; and anywhere we can serve all communities better, we should. The goal is that all the money we save should go into more savings for the community and that our two TV stations remain what they are already, although hopefully better. We're up against incredible competition from cable stations. We have to be able to combine our resources.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>He gets no argument from Mr. Cass. Within the next year, Mr. Cass said, Channel 21 will start using  Channel 13's new digital equipment to send its own signal over fiber-optic cable to its transmitter in Plainview. Channel 13's studios and production center are on West 33rd Street in Manhattan, and its signal, transmitted from the World Trade Center, can be received virtually everywhere on Long Island.</p><p>''There can be glitches,'' Mr. Cass said of the collaboration plans, ''but if we do this properly, the whole New York area will benefit.''</p><p>He added that savings could be realized by ''consolidating operations and taking some of the money going into the technical structure and putting it into programming.''</p><p>John Hayden, an aerospace engineer who grew up in Great Neck,  explained the differences between analog and digital signals. ''Unlike analog signals, which occur continuously in real time, digital signals are computer-generated representations of those same signals that can be altered and enhanced with the help of computer processors,'' he said. ''The magic of the digital concept is that the digital signals can be stored in computer memory, manipulated and then reconstructed and played back.''</p><p>Distance doesn't affect digital signals as much as it does analog signals, and digital signals provide crisper images and the same high-quality sound heard on compact discs and in most movie theaters.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission is encouraging television stations to convert digital signals by 2003. But the F.C.C. has also said that if 85 percent of Americans did not own digital sets by 2006, television stations would have to broadcast both analog and digital signals, as 170 stations already do, and as Channel 21 and Channel 13 will continue to do.</p><p>Currently, few people own digital television sets, and most of those who can receive digital signals use expensive add-on digital tuners. Manufacturers have hesitated to mass-produce digital television sets until the Federal Communications Commission determined a uniform standard for digital transmission.</p><p>David Fiske, a spokesman for the F.C.C., said: ''The U.S. has always had the same standard for transmitting digital TV, 8-VSB, and still does.'' But that the standard had been challenged by various organizations that prefer the standard known as COFDM, which is used in Europe and Japan.</p><p>Mr. Fiske said that on Feb. 4, the F.C.C. denied a petition from the  Sinclair Broadcast Group in Baltimore to allow broadcasters to transmit digital television signals using the COFDM standard, which may further encourage American manufacturers to produce digital television sets in great numbers.</p><p>Mr. Cass said that if Channel 21  had to buy its own digital broadcasting equipment, it would cost about  $10 million, a figure almost equal to its $11 million yearly operating budget.</p><p>To support themselves, both Channel 21 and Channel 13 solicit membership pledges, which account for about 20 percent of Channel 13's $157 million annual budget, but fully half of Channel 21's budget. Other money comes from corporations like the Chase Manhattan Bank, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Canon U.S.A. and  Starbucks and from foundations like  the National Science Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. About 15 percent of the stations' budgets come from the federal government, notably from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>He said that only 25 percent of Channel 21's 1.9 million weekly viewers were from Long Island, with 50 percent from New York City, 20 percent from Westchester County, and the rest from Connecticut and other areas. Channel 13 has some 6 million viewers a month, about a million of them on Long Island.</p><p>Will the collaboration of the two public stations be a good thing for Long Island? Robert Drucker, the owner and president of All Island Irrigation Inc. in Farmingdale, believes so. ''I'm delighted that digital technology will be replacing analog,'' he said. ''The technology has changed my business, and it will give all of us better TV reception and less interference.''</p><p>Abby Kenigsberg, the founder and executive director of the Long Island Coalition for Fair Broadcasting, in Garden City, was more guarded in her view. ''Long Island has 2.6 million people with their own problems and strengths that need to be addressed by the media here,'' she said. ''Long Island requires every resource it has, so any merger should be good for all Long Islanders.''</p><p>Mr. Cass agreed. ''With consolidation of resources,'' he said, ''we should be able to free funding, staff and resources for additional production, which would allow WLIW to produce more programming focused on Long Island.''</p><p>Photo: Channels 13 and 21 are seeking ways to save money together.
