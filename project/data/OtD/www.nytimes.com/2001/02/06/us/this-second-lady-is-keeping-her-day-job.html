''Laura here picked out a tie, adventurous because it wasn't red,'' she said. ''What color was it again?''</p><p>Later, while waiting for the ''surprisee,'' as she called him, to arrive, Mrs. Cheney wryly predicted his muted reaction, ''Dick will probably squeal, don't you think?''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Tart, take-charge and too busy to shop, the first second lady with a day job is getting back to work. She has been showing up regularly at the institute, where she has been a fellow since 1993 and is writing her sixth book, this one about the administration's signature issue, education reform. She was advising George W. Bush on education even before her husband signed on as his running mate, and her thinking could have a major impact on policy, though she plays this down.</p><p>Asked what effect her work might have, she smiled. ''Probably not much,'' she said dismissively. ''They're doing what the government does. I'm looking at the total picture.''</p><p>A former college professor with a doctorate in 19th-century English literature, Mrs. Cheney will also continue to sit on two corporate boards, at American Express Mutual Funds and Reader's Digest, waving off criticism that she has not resigned to avoid potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>Though she is intentionally keeping a low profile, she has also already influenced some key staffing decisions in the administration and has helped bring in a number of women, including former President George Bush's campaign aide Mary Matalin, a friend from CNN, where both appeared on ''Crossfire.''</p><p>Her old friend Alan K. Simpson, the former Wyoming senator, laughed when asked what role he expected her to take. ''Whatever she says it will be, it will be bigger,'' he said, describing her as ''just a whirlwind of a woman, and a believer, boy -- she's a piece of work.''</p><p>And perhaps in part because the new first lady, Laura Bush, has not had the kind of professional life her predecessor had, it is Mrs. Cheney who is being widely compared to Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>''They're both smart, both have independent careers, strong views and strong followings independent of their spouses,'' said a Washington friend of Mrs. Clinton who also knows Mrs. Cheney. ''Lynne could also have an independent political future and a political base.''</p><p>Mrs. Cheney's recent declaration that ''it wouldn't make sense that having had a career for my entire life that somehow overnight I would turn into a pumpkin or something'' did sound like a slightly more politic version of what Mrs. Clinton had to say back in 1992: ''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas.''</p><p>Yet, Mrs. Cheney is not exactly a Republican Hillary. For one thing, she knows Washington far better than Mrs. Clinton did when she arrived here from Arkansas eight years ago and is unlikely to seek a formal government role. Then again, she does not need one. ''She's on the cutting edge of these solutions on education,'' Ms. Matalin said.</p><p>Mrs. Cheney has probably sacrificed less professionally in deference to her husband than pre-senatorial Mrs. Clinton did and has not been defined by him in the symbiotic ''buy one, get one free'' sense that Mrs. Clinton was.</p><p>Though both women are considered more ideological than their husbands, this seems truer of Mrs. Cheney than of Mrs. Clinton, now a senator and member of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, whose leftist credentials are assumed by conservatives but have often been found lacking by actual liberals.</p><p>Mrs. Cheney says she still stands by every word she ever said -- whether against trigger locks or in defense of fur coats -- on ''Crossfire,'' where she argued the conservative viewpoint until 1998. Sometimes, she would sign off, ''From the right, and right on every issue, I'm Lynne Cheney.''</p><p>She also continues the battle against political correctness that she carried on as chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1986 to 1993.</p><p>But she has so far managed to disappoint Democrats who expected her to become a polarizing figure. During the campaign, she purposely stayed in the background.</p><p>''She doesn't fall into the traps that so many conservatives do, and is actually pretty good at not breaking the china and not giving her opponents easy shots,'' said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard.</p><p>In interviews last week, Mrs. Cheney certainly made every attempt to avoid controversy -- but did not will herself into dullness, either. She quoted Yeats, called herself a Calvinist who feels better about herself after a hard day at the office, and showed an edge of righteous anger.</p><p>She said that if a woman were president or vice president, ''and that is going to happen,'' and a man was in her position, ''everyone would think it odd if he didn't continue with his career.''</p>                </div>
