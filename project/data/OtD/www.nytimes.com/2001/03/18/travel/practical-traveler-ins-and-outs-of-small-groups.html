For them, small-group tours may offer a solution.    Small groups -- typically 6 to 20 -- can fit into family-run hotels and dine together at a table or two rather than being assigned to a separate room at a big place. They can also get access to historic homes or other sites too fragile to sustain hundreds of visitors a day. Such groups typically move on foot or in small vans rather than 50-passenger buses.   ">

For them, small-group tours may offer a solution.</p><p>Small groups -- typically 6 to 20 -- can fit into family-run hotels and dine together at a table or two rather than being assigned to a separate room at a big place. They can also get access to historic homes or other sites too fragile to sustain hundreds of visitors a day. Such groups typically move on foot or in small vans rather than 50-passenger buses.</p><p>The down side is that a small group may offer little escape from a member who is cranky or has a bulging ego. Operators of small-group tours acknowledge this hazard, although most say that their guides or leaders can handle or at least ''neutralize'' a difficult client.</p><p>Travelers should note that small groups and narrow profit margins mean that these companies set cancellation penalties that may seem severe. Clients who reserve with small companies should buy trip-cancellation insurance that will fit the need; that is, if one of two people traveling together dropped out, the insurance should cover payment of the single supplement.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Reading and Hiking</p><p>Here are a few established small-group companies:</p><p>Cross-Culture in Amherst, Mass., has 56 different tours in 26 countries in its catalog for this year, more than any other company contacted for this article. Marybeth Bridegam, the director, said that over the company's 14 years, its groups varied from 15 to 25 members, usually consisting of 7 or 8 pairs and 7 or 8 who occupied single rooms.</p><p>The catalog says that participants should be in good condition and prepared ''to enjoy considerable walking, often over uneven cobblestones.'' The listings include 20 hiking trips, graded for three levels of difficulty. The average age of hikers is 45 to 50, Ms. Bridegam said, 55 to 60 on other trips.</p><p>Like most in her field, Ms. Bridegam said participants were fairly well-educated, and were often repeat clients. The company's name and the its pretrip reading lists, she said, seemed to attract compatible people.</p><p>Ms. Bridegam's groups are seen off by an employee and met on arrival by a local tour leader, who stays with the group, and usually a specialized guide. Cross-Culture's tours this year include England, France, Italy, Greece and Turkey, Germany, Eastern European countries, and China and Japan.</p><p>The Danube and Beyond: World Heritage Sites in Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, Ms. Bridegam said, particularly embodies the company's wish to provide a movement across cultures: it visits both a 10th-century abbey and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp heritage site.  Scheduled for July 15 to 26, it starts in Budapest and concludes in Krakow. With hotels, three meals a day, at least one performance, play or concert, and air fare from New York, this tour costs $2,960 a person with two in a room; the single supplement is $320.</p><p>Cross-Culture, 52 High Point Drive, Amherst, Mass. 01002; (800) 491-1148; www.crosscultureinc.com.</p><p>Archetours of New York takes 6 to 20 people on a tour. The founder, Gail Cornell, an architectural historian who most of the tours, said that typically, half the partipants were solo travelers. Most of her clients over the company's six years, she added, have had advanced degrees and took multiple trips a year. The age range is 30 to 65, and most have a focus on architecture or the arts.</p><p>This year's flier has nine different tours, each graded for physical activity level. The Bilbao-Barcelona trip is offered four times, two suitable for people with varying levels of fitness and two for ''active, fit'' people who walk with no difficulty; those over 70 are asked for proof of fitness.</p><p>A new trip this year in the higher-priced ''connoisseur'' level is Berlin: Building the New City, Aug. 24 to 31. Ms. Cornell said the group would have dinner in the Reichstag dome, and see construction nearby, Mies van der Rohe's National Gallery, and the incomplete Jewish Museum.</p><p>With two meals a day and seven nights in the Four Seasons Hotel, the cost is $4,595 a person with two in a room. The single supplement is $825. The tour begins at the Berlin Airport; Archetours does not handle air arrangements.</p><p>Archetours Inc., 260 West Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10013; (800) 770-3051; www.archetours.com.</p><p>Solo Traveler Appeal</p><p>Humanities Abroad of Boston lists six trips this year: Crete and Greece; Cambridge; Dublin; and three in the Florence area. Sylvia Chambliss-Hare, the director, said she would run a trip with as few as six people, and in the main they involved 10 to 15. She said most of her participants were women traveling solo; some were with spouses or friends. She said that tour members generally paid the single supplement. In Dublin, the group stays at Trinity College, where private rooms and shared bathrooms are the norm.</p><p>''The average in our groups is a master's degree,'' she said. ''They are well-educated and well-read and usually in their mid-50's.''</p><p>The company began in 1975; Ms. Chambliss-Hare joined it in 1984 and bought it in 1998. A former teacher, she goes with a number of trips; other leaders are former teachers or former participants.</p><p>Crete and Classical Greece: Where History and Myth Converge, June 17 to 30, is a new tour this year. It begins in Heraklion, Crete, and goes on to Athens. The tour will be led by Eleni Zachariou, a professional guide and lecturer. With 12 breakfasts, 3 lunches and 7 dinners, and air fare from New York or Boston, the price is $3,600 a person with two in a room; the single supplement is $450.</p><p>Humanities Abroad, 11 Gloucester Street, Boston, Mass. 02115; (800) 754-9991; www.humanitiesabroad .com.</p><p>Basque Travel in Brooklyn specializes in trips to San Sebasti&aacute;n, Bilbao and Barcelona, with seven departures remaining this year. It has a few sidelines, including a trip to see -- or participate in -- the running of the bulls in Pamplona.  Enrique Zaldua, the owner, said that the company, in business about four years, usually takes 10 to 14 people, never more than 20.</p><p>Mr. Zaldua said that his clients arrived mostly in pairs. He said that few spoke much Spanish and none Basque.</p><p>The Basque tour visits the Guggenheim in Bilbao and makes an excursion to Guernica. It goes to Gaudi's park and cathedral and the Picasso Museum in Barcelona, flying from Bilbao to Barcelona. Where a city is walkable, Mr. Zaldua said that his tours walked, but in Barcelona, he used a minibus.</p><p>Last year, he took 250 people on his tours, including to the San Sebasti&aacute;n jazz festival and some short eating trips. The Basque trips cost $2,225 each, with two in a room, including breakfasts and six other meals, usually lunch, most days. The single supplement is $475. Tours begin in San Sebasti&aacute;n.</p><p>Basque Travel, 179 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217; (718) 789-5863; www.basquetravel.com. Mr. Zaldua is often in Spain, and says e-mail is the best way to get in touch: ezaldua @basquetravel.com.</p><p>Drawing (William Waitzman)</p>                </div>
