She was on the honor roll for four straight years, and she lettered in field hockey and won awards for music, Latin and horseback riding. Yet she did not get into college. Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Brown and Wesleyan rejected her; after putting her on the waiting list, so did Amherst and the University of Chicago. ''I spent the spring watching friends put college stickers on their cars while I tried to figure out what I was going to do with my life,'' Catesby remembers. ''As in, what was I at this point if not 'collegebound'?''    In 1985, when I graduated from high school, above-average grades and a few extracurriculars meant you could at least shoot for the Ivies. These days, that assumption would be hubris. Last year, a record 1.26 million high schoolers took the College Boards; admission rates at the most elite schools have fallen almost to 10 percent.  ">

''I spent the spring watching friends put college stickers on their cars while I tried to figure out what I was going to do with my life,'' Catesby remembers. ''As in, what was I at this point if not 'collegebound'?''</p><p>In 1985, when I graduated from high school, above-average grades and a few extracurriculars meant you could at least shoot for the Ivies. These days, that assumption would be hubris. Last year, a record 1.26 million high schoolers took the College Boards; admission rates at the most elite schools have fallen almost to 10 percent.</p><p>To understand just how much has changed, I resubmit my own college application in the current overheated market. First, I ask Concord Academy, my old boarding school in Massachusetts, to fax a copy of my transcript. Then I call Krista Klein, an independent counselor and coauthor of ''How to Get Into the Top Colleges,'' and we chat about my high-school career. ''Colleges aren't interested in the captain of the lacrosse team or the editor of the yearbook any more,'' Klein told me, which, at first, I take for good news. ''They're looking for students whose initiative has led them to make unique contributions in their intellectual and extracurricular lives.'' Oh.</p><p>After we go over my SAT scores (660 verbal, 620 math) and my grades (B-plus average), Klein politely asks where I see myself going to college.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''How about Princeton?'' I ask.</p><p>''I'd say Princeton isn't even a possibility for you,'' she answers.</p><p>''How about Brown?''</p><p>''If you have one dream school, go ahead and apply. Go for it.''</p><p>''But I went to Brown,'' I say, meekly.</p><p>''To be honest,'' she says, ''even Vassar is a reach.''</p><p>Vassar, my safety school of yore, has seen a 40 percent increase in applicants since 1996. Still, I call David Borus, dean of admissions there, and pitch my candidacy. He tells me that a change in the way College Boards are calculated boosts my verbal score to about 710; unfortunately, it doesn't help. He suggests I do volunteer work while attending community college, write a new essay and reapply the following year.</p><p>Peter Jennings, my high school's college counselor, kindly offers to call around for me. He says he knows several schools around the country that would love a ''pied piper'' from Concord, provided I didn't need financial aid or anything. He rattles off a list of names; schools like Earlham in Indiana and Rhodes in Tennessee, which Jennings calls ''regional gems,'' have seen their strong local applicant pool dwindle as more students try for big-name colleges in the Northeast.</p><p>There are also still a few ways to sneak in the back door of a brand-name institution. Humanities types like me can try M.I.T. or Johns Hopkins, where English majors are relatively exotic; or, if I don't mind trading male comrades for a distinguished sounding alma mater, how about Mount Holyoke or Bryn Mawr? There's also Europe. British schools and the American University in Paris offer rolling admissions, and Jennings says he has seen students successfully transfer after a year or two spent ''maturing'' on foreign shores. However, like 16,800 other kids this year, I just know I'm Brown material. I decide I'll do whatever it takes to get in.</p><p>So it's back to Krista Klein, who doesn't think my problems are academic. Rather, she says, I lack passion and initiative. ''Schools want academics and extracurriculars, but they also want what Stanford calls intellectual vitality. That's what your application needs.''</p><p>Klein suggests I take a year off, live at home and play to my strengths. ''Fifteen years ago I might have said you need more math and science to look well rounded, but things are different now.'' She notes that Brown, with its unorthodox curriculum, especially likes students who show independence; if I intern at a newspaper, I can showcase both my writing and my gumption. I also need some community service. ''Right now,'' she tells me, ''you look a little rich-kiddy.'' Volunteering at an adult-literacy program will make good essay fodder, and it would emphasize my interest in English as well.</p><p>I call Michael Goldberger, Brown's director of admissions, and quickly summarize my new application. ''She gave you great advice,'' he says. ''Intellectual vitality -- I like that.'' But do I get in? ''People always want to reduce admissions to its barest particulars,'' he muses. I hold my breath.</p><p>''O.K.,'' he says.</p><p>Catesby took a different approach. She moved to Mexico last fall, where she lived with a host family and took classes in Spanish and art. Meanwhile, she aggressively pursued early admission at Wesleyan. ''I talked to a trustee,'' she says. ''She told me she can't use her influence to help a student get in, but I met with her anyway to show how much I wanted to go.'' Applying in the fall helped, too; early applicants at many schools are about twice as likely to get in. Still, as Catesby says, ''the applicant on paper was the same person they rejected the year before.''</p><p>This time, though, Catesby got her thick envelope. In the fall she'll enter Wesleyan's class of 2005.</p><p>Photo (Tom Schierlitz)  </p>                </div>
