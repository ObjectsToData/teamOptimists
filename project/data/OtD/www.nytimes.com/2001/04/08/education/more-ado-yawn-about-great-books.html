Literature majors were the humanities' Green Berets, an elite corps trained on a rarefied diet of semiotics and deconstruction -- the latest French imports -- to expose the contradictions, inconsistencies and general sloppiness that had infected not just literature and criticism but all of Western thought since, well, Aristotle at least. A relatively recent addition to the curriculum, the literature major was conceived as a junior version of the university's graduate program in comparative literature. Unlike English majors, we were required to take classes in a foreign literature and expected to think about big questions -- like ''What is literature?'' -- from a comparative perspective.   ">

I read Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man, Mikhail Bakhtin and Walter Benjamin. Not that I read only theory. These were literature courses, after all. I read lots of novels, too -- Thomas Pynchon's ''Crying of Lot 49,'' G&uuml;nter Grass's ''Tin Drum'' and ''Les Gu 1/8rrill&egrave;res,'' a lyrical fantasy about a society without men by the French radical lesbian Monique Wittig.</p><p>I met my degree requirements by taking ''Feminist Literary Criticisms'' and ''Women and the Avant-Garde,'' as well as two courses devoted principally to film, and a seminar on Beckett and Nabokov. For my thesis, I wrote on novels by Marguerite Duras, Milan Kundera and Toni Morrison, all of them published within the last 30 years. I graduated without having read for credit ''The Odyssey,'' ''Paradise Lost,'' a single play by Shakespeare or a single novel by Jane Austen, George Eliot or Henry James.</p>                </div>

                    <p>To groups like the American Council of Trustees and Alumni and the National Association of Scholars, I am an object lesson in miseducation. My college career is precisely the kind of scandal they have vowed to eradicate.</p><p>If you thought the culture wars were over, you're not alone. After more than a decade of highly publicized skirmishes, the alternately entertaining and exasperating verbal slugfest between left and right -- much of it over the proper role and content of something called the Western Canon in the education of America's college students -- seemed lately to have faded from view. By the end of the 1990's, the torrent of righteous polemic ignited by Allan Bloom's ''Closing of the American Mind'' in 1987 had slowed to a trickle. The culture wars were routinely summed up in a few stock phrases -- political correctness, multiculturalism, the Great Books and dead white men -- whose ability to summon outrage had been severely diminished by overuse. In her new book, ''Academic Instincts,'' Marjorie Garber, a Harvard English professor and leading Shakespeare scholar, writes of the culture wars in the past tense, as a ''formulation that was always more hype or buzz than pedagogical reality.''</p><p>But Ms. Garber may have spoken too soon. With a conservative administration in the White House and a president whose thoughts about education can be boiled down to the word ''standards,'' the advocacy groups founded to save the classics are enjoying a second wind.</p><p>''The culture wars seem to be over because people opposed to the classics have won so complete a victory at so many colleges,'' says Jerry Martin, the president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. ''But there are real signs of renewal of interest in Great Books.''</p><p>Dedicated to preserving traditional core curriculums from the predations of multicultural-minded leftists, the council must have been one of the only ideological organizations in America watching the presidential race with something close to indifference. ''No matter which party wins, so does the council,'' The New York Times reported last August, noting that Lynne Cheney and Joseph I. Lieberman were founding members and that Mrs. Cheney at the time was the group's chairwoman.</p><p>Since 1996, when Georgetown University announced that courses in Chaucer, Milton and Shakespeare, once required of English majors, would henceforth be electives, the council has been quietly racking up victories on behalf of the Great Books. After the announcement, the council commissioned a study of English literature programs at 70 major colleges and universities. ''The abandonment of Shakespeare requirements is not merely a trend; it is now the norm,'' the group's report declared. ''Of the 70 universities, only 23 now require English majors to take a course in Shakespeare.''</p><p>The report went on to explain why Americans should care: ''It matters to us all if Shakespeare and other great authors are allowed to languish. This country cannot expect a generation raised on gangster films and sex studies to maintain its leadership in the world.'' In other words, the culture wars aren't some obscure academic debate. Shakespeare's demise in the classroom is a matter of national security.</p>                </div>
