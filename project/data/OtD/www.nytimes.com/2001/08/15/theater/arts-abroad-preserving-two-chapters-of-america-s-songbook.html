A new one -- call it Packard and McGlinn -- has landed here with ambitions that rival those of the most starry-eyed Broadway show.</p><p>John McGlinn, 47, is an American conductor and music historian known for his painstaking restorations and performances of shows like Jerome Kern's ''Show Boat.'' David Packard, 60, is a classics scholar and chairman of Packard Humanities Institute, a foundation in Los Altos, Calif., that sponsors research into subjects as varied as archaeology, Bach, Greek papyri and silent films.</p><p>Financed by Mr. Packard's charity and inspired by its commitment to cultural treasure hunting, Mr. McGlinn has embarked on a mission of researching and recording all the shows and songs of both Kern and Victor Herbert, two composers of the early 20th century whose prodigious output will require an estimated 15 years to assemble and preserve.</p><p>The project was begun this summer, and already the sprightly melodies, exuberant orchestrations and snazzy lyrics of shows like Kern's ''Have a Heart'' from 1917 and Herbert's ''Babes of Toyland'' of 1903 are filling the high-curtained spaces of a former church on London's South Bank used for recording and rehearsal by London orchestras. The first discs should be available next year.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. McGlinn is a whirligig of activity in the midst of all the music making. Mr. Packard, known to guard his privacy, follows the project from home, listening to the results on tapes and occasionally muttering over the phone in disgruntled-producer mode about the costs of flying American singers back and forth across the Atlantic.</p><p>Mr. Packard protectively calls this the ''trial year'' of the undertaking but quickly adds that he has a habit of finishing what he starts. ''I find if you set yourself impossible goals, you end up achieving them,'' he said.</p><p>It is cheaper over all to record here, but Mr. McGlinn said that the real attraction was working with the London Sinfonietta, Britain's premier contemporary-music ensemble. ''They're used to playing really difficult stuff, and they're the best sight readers in the world,'' he said.</p><p>Mr. McGlinn is known for his ferocious tenacity as an historical scavenger. But he met his match in Mr. Packard. Mr. McGlinn said he first called him to ask if he would support a $100,000 project to restore some Kern orchestrations. ''Then, with trembling voice, I said, 'And maybe we could even record one or two?' '' Mr. McGlinn recalled.</p><p>''David said: 'What's the point of that? Why not record them all?' ''</p><p>In a telephone interview from Italy, where he was vacationing, Mr. Packard explained: ''I thought it was an astonishing gap. With Mozart, Beethoven and Bach we have serious scholarly editions.'' With much of Kern and Herbert, ''all you have are some 78's from the time the shows were produced and some sheet music.''</p><p>A Harvard classics Ph.D. who taught at the University of North Carolina and the University of California at Los Angeles, Mr. Packard likes to fill gaps.</p><p>''David's fundamental philosophy seems to be to acquire all human knowledge and give it away free,'' Mr. McGlinn said in a voice set somewhere in the key of wonder.</p><p>Mr. Packard said his purpose was to make a critical edition of all the music.</p><p>''That means we will evaluate all the sources for variations and collect whatever surviving material exists, using the same historical critical methods classical scholars use when they examine all the possible explanations for why, say, Virgil used one word instead of the other,'' he said. ''In this case we'll study all the evidence and make elaborate footnotes for something like whether there is or is not a slur between two notes. It doesn't make a difference to everybody, but people like us really want to get it right.''</p><p>The theater music of Kern (composer of songs like like ''Ol' Man River,'' ''The Way You Look Tonight'' and ''Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'') and Herbert (''Sweethearts,'' ''Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!'') was aimed at Tin Pan Alley as well as Broadway.</p><p>It was the popular music of the time, and these composers knew they were writing for dance bands and radio broadcasts as well as for the stage. Their lyricists -- one of whom was the British humorist P. G. Wodehouse -- had a grand time with frivolous language, internal rhymes and groaner puns. They invoked a world of cafe society mishaps, porch romances and summer nights scented with honeysuckle and filled with fireflies.</p><p>''It would be fashionable to say that it was a better world back then,'' Mr. McGlinn said. ''Well, it probably wasn't, but at least more people were willing to dream of one.''</p><p>The songs may sound dated, but the social dilemmas they delighted in linger on.</p><p>Had trouble making conversation in a noisy restaurant recently? Here's how Kern and Wodehouse handled the subject in ''Have a Heart'' from 1917:</p><p>Alas, in these days of the cabaret craze</p><p>You cannot converse when you dine.</p><p>If they'd only can the cabaret</p><p>If they'd only send the jazz band far away</p><p>If they'd only try to quiet all the syncopated riot</p><p>We could sometimes have a word or two to say.</p><p>If they'd only can the cabaret</p><p>If they'd send the hula dancers on their way</p><p>We could breathe our passion fervent</p><p>While the crowd was unobservant</p><p>And we wouldn't have to shout the things we say.</p><p>The shows of Kern and Herbert were hit parades of waltzes, polkas, fox trots, turkey trots, two steps, Gilbert and Sullivan-style patter songs and ballads overripe with sentimentality. It was the sound of a young country feeling its oats. Some of the music forms may have had their origins in Europe, but these composers repackaged them in bold splashes of stars and stripes.</p><p>''This was a time when New York was really growing, with different groups coming over and massive building going on,'' said Robert Kimball, the New York musical-theater historian and author who is serving the project as artistic advisor. ''These musicals were comments on that time, however oblique. There was much more theater, it was a vibrant time.''</p><p>''You could make your money back in three months, and then the shows would go on extensive tours crisscrossing the U.S.,'' he continued. ''People went out to be entertained, they didn't expect to walk out at the end feeling they had just seen Pirandello.''</p><p>These composers labored to meet the demand. Kern wrote eight shows in 1917 alone. He and his contemporaries also wrote songs for operetta imports from Europe that needed some New World juicing up and for movie soundtracks, and they would write new songs for their own shows and throw out old ones as different performers came and went.</p><p>''Sometimes you'll find the same tunes in four different shows,'' Mr. McGlinn said. ''Kern wasted nothing.''</p><p>So what would Jerome Kern think of this project? He was the leading melodist of his day, but he thought he was writing music to divert his contemporaries, not to return as classics in a new century.</p><p>''When I was doing 'Show Boat' I asked his daughter, Betty Kern Miller, that question,'' said Mr. McGlinn. ''She said: 'Obviously he would have been thrilled. But after he got through saying he was thrilled, he simply wouldn't have believed it.'
