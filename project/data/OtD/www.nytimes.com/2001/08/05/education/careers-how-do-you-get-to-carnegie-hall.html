''I just love music,'' he said, shrugging. ''I want to play whatever comes my way.'' A year away from completing a bachelor's degree at the Manhattan School of Music, he can perhaps afford to be dreamy. But one afternoon in May, after a four-hour practice session, Mr. Kantor looked in on the job-networking fair in the school cafeteria.     ''I'm curious to know what's out there,'' he said.   ">

                    <p>With his tan fedora set atop a headful of dark curls and a wine-colored velvet corduroy blazer worn over a T-shirt, Justin Kantor resembles a roving troubador with a cello. ''I just love music,'' he said, shrugging. ''I want to play whatever comes my way.'' A year away from completing a bachelor's degree at the Manhattan School of Music, he can perhaps afford to be dreamy. But one afternoon in May, after a four-hour practice session, Mr. Kantor looked in on the job-networking fair in the school cafeteria.</p><p>''I'm curious to know what's out there,'' he said.</p><p>Free pizza attracted some of the students buzzing around tables, where unions touted health benefits, temp agencies promised office jobs with time off for auditions, and CD producers, publicity photographers and loan repayment officers all shined as glaring a light on the music business as the noon sun bouncing off the white linoleum floor.</p><p>A catchy head shot may not seem crucial to a musician's future, but John Blanchard, career development director at the Manhattan School, believes otherwise. ''A musician today needs to be a small-business person and build a career that way,'' he said. ''Managers don't take young potential talents under their wings and develop them the way they used to do. It's up to the musician now to get the work, to decide what the head shot should look like, to write the bio. Competition has driven the level of musicianship up. What sets you apart now is business savvy.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Earlier this year, the National Association of Schools of Music, an accrediting organization, revised its guidelines to state that students should acquire the entrepreneurial skills necessary to advance their careers. In an attempt to create a new paradigm for the classical music marketplace, the Manhattan School, the New England Conservatory, the Juilliard School and other conservatories have begun equipping young concert artists with practical communication tools, as well as steeping them in musical theory, history and musicianship. At the Mary Pappert School of Music at Duquesne, students learn about copyright law and retirement planning. At the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music, they attend lectures in management and finance. The Catherine Filene Shouse Arts Leadership Program at the Eastman School of Music balances ''big thoughts'' -- like contemplating the future of the American orchestra -- with grant-seeking classes and Web- casting, says James Undercofler, the school's dean and director. ''We call it leadership because we don't want it to sound like music business or management,'' he said.</p><p>Career development officers have become missionaries of change, but many conservatories remain stubbornly tradition-bound. The typical school is still grounded in the European ethos of Bach, Beethoven and Brahms: Practice is seen as the surest path to the concert hall, and artistic sensibility rules. Some fear that a more holistic approach will draw energy away from virtuosity.</p><p>Catherine Fitterman, a pianist with a degree in arts administration, thought she knew a thing or two about the world of music when she founded the Entrepreneurship Center for Music at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1998. What better gift than to share her business knowledge with talented but inexperienced young people? But when she began talking to aspiring virtuosos about employment probabilities and backup plans, they didn't want to hear about it. ''Let's face it, if Liszt walked through here today he would not be uncomfortable,'' Ms. Fitterman said. ''The students didn't want to know what to expect when they go out into the world. The performance majors want to screen out the rest of the world, hunker down and build their musicianship. They don't even like to leave the building.''</p><p>While the notion that ''art and business do not mix'' is loosening, ''it is still with us,'' Ms. Fitterman said. ''The students said, 'The word business makes us think we can't succeed as performers.' ''</p><p>Amanda Ford, the career development officer at Duquesne in Pittsburgh, remembers her own struggles after studying composing at Carnegie Mellon University. ''It was the day after graduation and I woke up,'' she said. ''What was I going to do? So what if I could write a song or a quartet? I had no clue about r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, networking, terms we use every day now. During four years of undergraduate school no one talked to us about how to get out there. So I worked on commission, did part-time teaching, was a jingle writer in Chicago. I made it work, and that's how I want the students to be. It's good to be optimistic, but you have to be realistic.''</p><p>According to the National Association of Schools of Music, 94,307 students were enrolled in undergraduate or graduate music programs in fall 2000, nearly a 12,000 student increase from 1996. If the nearly 4,000 concert performers who graduated in June 2000 had hoped to play in an orchestra, they would have had to compete not only with one another but also with thousands of equally well-trained graduates from previous years. Yet only 400 to 500 jobs were available in the country's major orchestras -- that is, those that pay a living wage. The players keep their jobs for decades, and hundreds audition for each spot. This, along with decreased government aid to the arts, strained budgets and the explosion of entertainment choices for consumers, has contributed to the need for better informed and articulate musicians who can, say, argue their case for a grant or put together a living from various sources.</p><p>As Ms. Ford put it, ''It's not just how great your chops are but how well you can sell yourself.''</p>                </div>
