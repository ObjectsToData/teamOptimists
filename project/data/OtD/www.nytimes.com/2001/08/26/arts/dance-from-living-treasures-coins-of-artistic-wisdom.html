The 100 ''treasures'' were selected for their artistic excellence, their impact on dance as an art form, their enrichment of the nation's cultural heritage, their national and internation recognition and their potential to enhance the lives of future generations. Now a commemorative booklet has been published featuring descriptions and photographs of the honorees.     The list runs the gamut of genres and generations, from the tapper Honi Coles to the early Balanchine ballerina Alexandra Danilova, from the film director Busby Berkeley to the bharata natyam guru Balasaraswati, from the New Dance Group of the 1930's to the Judson Dance Theater of the 1960's, and from ''The Nutcracker'' to the hula.

Now a commemorative booklet has been published featuring descriptions and photographs of the honorees.</p><p>The list runs the gamut of genres and generations, from the tapper Honi Coles to the early Balanchine ballerina Alexandra Danilova, from the film director Busby Berkeley to the bharata natyam guru Balasaraswati, from the New Dance Group of the 1930's to the Judson Dance Theater of the 1960's, and from ''The Nutcracker'' to the hula.</p><p>The booklet offers a useful historical perspective on choreographic careers and accomplishments. But how might the living treasures speak about their own work? The list provides an occasion to solicit the views of the artists themselves -- to hear them sum up their legacies and say how they might explain their work to an audience 50 years from now. Their responses, below, range from the earnest to the whimsical. Each artist's language, concerns and sense of history are as distinctive as what they have created.</p><p>CHARLES (CHOLLY) ATKINS</p>                </div>

                    <p>Motown choreographer and performer with Coles and Atkins</p><p>I would tell them the same thing as I'd tell them today. My work, if learned well and executed well, will endure decade after decade after decade.</p><p>TRISHA BROWN</p><p>Artistic director, Trisha Brown Dance Company</p><p>My purpose is to communicate through choreography that meets the standards applied to visual art. I work in cycles to address a question or an unknown. This system perpetuates me forward through a wide range of concerns. I play with meaning and nonmeaning in abstraction, depiction in opera and formal ideas always.</p><p>WILLIAM CHRISTENSEN</p><p>Founder and special adviser to the board, Ballet West</p><p>I fought like hell and they always wanted to do it their way, but I outwitted them and got it to go my way. That's how it's always been and still is. I'm honest and kind, and I wouldn't hurt a flea, but don't get in my way. Did you know I used to box?</p><p>CHUCK DAVIS</p><p>Artistic director, African American Dance Ensemble, and founder, Dance Africa America</p><p>I would share with them something I wrote during my morning's meditation: ''The sounds of time caught in the heartbeat is reflected in dance that honors the universe.'' I want to be acknowledged as one of many, many dancers in this century who opened a safe path for others to realize the beauty of dance and its place in our world culture.</p><p>JANE DUDLEY</p><p>Choreographer, New Dance Group</p><p>I try to filter through my dance what I feel about the period I am living in -- positive or critical. I work from the music. I choose music that speaks to me in a meaningful way. I hope by doing so I convey my own aims and healthy wishes.</p><p>KATHERINE DUNHAM</p><p>Choreographer, performer and founder, Katherine Dunham Centers for Dance and Humanities</p><p>I hope that they do not look at the work as something stationary, something that happened and was finished when I go. I hope that they think of it as a continuous and ongoing thing. I'd feel good about that.</p><p>ANNA HALPRIN</p><p>Founder, San Francisco Dancers' Workshop, and co-founder, Tamalpa Institute</p><p>I work toward a future where more of us call ourselves artists, working together to make art concerned with the primary issues of life; a future where art is honored for its power to inspire, teach, transform and heal. I work for a future where all the people, creatures and landscapes of the world are dancing together.</p><p>BILL T. JONES</p><p>Artistic director, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company</p><p>At a time when the piercing wail of anxiety and discontent at the loss of a true moral voice was at a fever pitch, I felt like a cultural mendicant faced with two choices: to go into the cloistered order of individualism and art as aesthetic research or to become the warrior engaged in the pursuit of art as an instrument for social change. I moved forward with uncertainty and some joy, equipped only with a gnawing desire to create a belief in the beautiful and the true.</p><p>BELLA LEWITZKY</p><p>Founder, Bella Lewitzky Dance Company</p><p>I never had so much fun doing anything else in my life. Dance is irreplaceably wonderful.</p><p>SOPHIE MASLOW</p><p>Choreographer, New Dance Group</p><p>My choreography was attuned to what was happening in the world, in terms of individual relationships and larger issues such as war and Southern race relations. The work was about my own responses and the fact that there was not enough response coming from other people and that nothing much was done about these things, until it was too late. They were concerns that hovered over me, that I couldn't shake off. I didn't think that a dance would make the situation better. It was about a feeling I had that I wanted to share with other people.</p><p>MATTEO</p><p>Artistic director, Foundation for Ethnic Dance</p><p>I was especially fortunate to have Carola Goya, famous American pioneer of classical Spanish dance, as my partner, wife and spiritual mentor, who believed that one was born with a dual purpose -- to think and create. We did what was called ''ethnic'' dance, which comprised the classical dances from countries around the world. I'm eternally grateful to my first teacher, La Meri, and the many gurus and maestros who taught me their classical dances to pass on to my fellow Americans.</p><p>DONALD McKAYLE</p><p>Founder, Donald McKayle and Company, and professor, University of California at Irvine</p><p>My work has always dealt with the human spirit and resonated within the aspirations, physicality, dreams and reality of vibrantly alive people.</p><p>MARK MORRIS</p><p>Artistic director, Mark Morris Dance Group</p><p>Since I will most probably be dead in 50 years, I am happy to imagine thousands of 75-year-olds who will still be in love after meeting on a blind date at one of my shows when they were young.</p><p>FAYARD NICHOLAS</p><p>Choreographer and performer with the Nicholas Brothers</p><p>My brother and I started out in 1930. I first started performing in colleges, theater, benefits and plays. I just picked it up. I never had a lesson. I saved a lot of money. We created a new style. We called it ''classical tap.'' It had a combination of a little ballet with the tap. The thing of it is, we used our whole bodies, especially the hands. It had class, grace and personality.</p><p>JENNIFER TIPTON</p><p>Lighting designer</p><p>I would tell them that I always tried to give dancers an environment, a place to be that was special for that particular dance. I tried to illuminate the ideas of the choreographer as well as the movement. I paid particular attention to the structure and the rhythm of the dance and created light that was either in sync with that structure and rhythm or in counterpoint to it. I would tell them that I loved all dance no matter what its style and that my aim was to make beautiful dancers beautiful even if they were doing an ugly dance.</p><p>EDWARD VILLELLA</p><p>Artistic director, Miami City Ballet</p><p>I had the great pleasure of working with the masters of the 20th century -- George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, Igor Stravinsky and my teacher and coach Stanley Williams. I believe the works done by Balanchine and Robbins will still be in the active repertory at that time, just as the works of Petipa are still current and active in today's repertory.</p><p>Photos: The Nicholas Brothers, Harold, left, and Fayard, in the 1941 film ''Sun Valley Serenade.''
