The idea that life, in all its variety, ought to flourish is simply seen by most people as good. Ideas, however, are not regarded with anything like the same reverence. But they should be.     When an intellectual tradition disappears from public life, it diminishes a culture's ability to reflect upon itself, to learn from its past or to imagine possible futures. This is just what has happened over the the past three decades in the United States, where the humanities -- literary criticism, history, anthropology, sociology and art history among them -- have broadly retreated from the public fray and into on-campus fiefs.

There are roughly 9,000 philosophy Ph.D.'s in the country. More than 5,000 of them teach at four-year colleges, according to the American Philosophical Association, but few Americans would be able to recognize the name, much less the work, of a single one.</p><p>There is arguably a particular cost to philosophy's retreat, because, in an age when politicians, talk show hosts, rappers, journalists and infomercials saturate the environment with their aggressive messages, philosophy's methods of inquiry, and the skeptical habits of mind they instill, can help people sort honest argument from dishonest, the well-founded claim from bald assertion.</p>                </div>

                    <p>So it is a bad thing for Americans that a man named Simon Blackburn left the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this month for England, to take the Chair in Philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge University. It is a post once held by Ludwig Wittgenstein and G. E. Moore. ''A little pinnacle in our profession,'' Mr. Blackburn says happily.</p><p>Mr. Blackburn is the rare contemporary philosopher who willingly makes the effort to communicate with nonphilosophers -- to the point of maintaining a Web site (graced with a dashing photograph of himself ''looking philosophical'') and offering visitors encouragement to begin a ''meaningful interaction'' via e-mail.</p><p>Philosophers often explain, or explain away, their obscurity by insisting that theirs is a rarefied craft that can be understood only through a specialized language, a bit like physicists, mathematicians or geneticists. But, then, many thousands of ordinary men and women choose, from sheer curiosity, to spend their free time reading books and watching television documentaries about quantum physics, Fermat's Last Theorem and the unfolding mysteries of the human genome.</p><p>Philosophers, on the other hand, practice a vocation that for most of its existence has sought, as Bertrand Russell once wrote, to ''make us know the ends of life, and the elements in life that have value on their own account.'' Surely, that's a project for ordinary men and women as well.</p><p>It is true that, from Socrates to Gottfried Leibniz, from David Hume to William James, philosophy has concerned itself with technical matters. But it also maintained ''a two-way conversation'' with society, said Alisdair MacIntyre, a moral philosopher at Notre Dame, whose work explores the nature and meaning of human freedom.</p><p>After World War II, however, the philosopher became isolated within the university, where the field increasingly focused on the sort of specialization likely to land a graduate student a teaching post. The word philosophy may literally mean love of wisdom, but as a practical matter, it has come to mean love of tenure.</p><p>AT present, said Mr. MacIntyre, public discourse simply goes its raucous way ''without taking standards of reasoning seriously.'' If nothing else, philosophy has worked out those standards over 2,500 years. But as Brian Leiter, a professor of philosophy and law at the University of Texas at Austin, has written, faculty members at the most prestigious departments are likely to be ''very smart (clever, quick, analytically acute), but less often deep.''</p><p>Mr. Leiter, the creator of ''The Philosophical Gourmet,'' an annual ranking of philosophy programs that is the bible of graduate students, adds that these enviably placed academics tend to sound ''unbearably trite and superficial once they venture beyond the technical problems and methods to which their specialized training best suits them, and try to assume the mantle of 'public intellectual.' ''</p><p>The about-to-be-repatriated Mr. Blackburn recently made a spirited attack on this depressing record. Last fall Oxford University Press published his book, ''Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy,'' which, despite a lack of reviews and a vaguely insulting title (if you think about it) found a sizable audience. More than 30,000 hardcover copies have been sold, and Oxford has asked Mr. Blackburn to follow up with ''Being Good,'' a guide to the philosophy of ethics, which is to be published in  May.</p><p>It has been said that the first prerequisite for a citizen of a democracy is an immunity to eloquence. Philosophy, said Mr. Blackburn, should help to inoculate people against false appeals and baseless assertions -- just the sort of thing that passes for debate in America's polarized culture. In ''Why Bother to Think,'' an address he delivered last year at the University of North Carolina, where he has taught since 1990, Mr. Blackburn said, ''People who have cut their teeth on philosophical problems of rationality, knowledge, perception, free will and other minds are well placed to think better about problems of evidence, decision making, responsibility and ethics that life throws up.''</p><p>Mr. Blackburn writes that ''Think'' is ''for people who want to think about the big themes: knowledge, reason, truth, mind, freedom, destiny, identity, God, goodness, justice.'' They are not, he insists, ''the hidden preserve of specialists. They are things that men and women wonder about naturally, for they structure the ways we think about the world and our place in it.''</p><p>In a similar vein, Wittgenstein, whose post Mr. Blackburn has just assumed, wrote: ''The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.'' It's the habit of thinking critically, aided by techniques developed over more than two millennia. It's hard work, but it's for everybody.</p><p>THIS is an idea that has nearly been lost. The public perception of philosophy today is closer to the definition of wisdom offered by ''The Philosophical Lexicon,'' a satirical dictionary compiled by the philosopher Daniel Dennett and published online: ''A state of clarity and understanding so complete and exhaustive, yet also so detailed and complex, as to be totally incommunicable.''</p><p>Photo: Italian Renaissance philosophers got out and about, if Giorgione's ''Three Philosophers in a Landscape'' is to be believed.</p>                </div>
