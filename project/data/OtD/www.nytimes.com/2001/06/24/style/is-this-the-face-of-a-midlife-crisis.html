But that's all over now. He has divorced his wife, quit the wireless sales rat race and moved back to his hometown in northeast Pennsylvania.</p><p>The old midlife crisis strikes again, with one new wrinkle: the guy is 27.</p><p>''I was king of the world, but I didn't feel fulfilled,'' he said, asking not to be named because of embarrassment over his circumstances. ''That started the snowball, and it all started rolling downhill from there.''</p><p>Regrets about the past. Yearning for work that is spiritually fulfilling, not just lucrative. Misgivings about relationships. It turns out that many 20-somethings are wrestling with the kinds of issues long associated with middle age. They're having their ''American Beauty'' moment a decade or two ahead of schedule.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Think of it as a mid-midlife crisis. Or as some are calling it, a ''quarterlife crisis.''</p><p>Besides the classic midlife symptoms, 20-somethings have a few others particular to their generation. Having come of age in a period of spectacular boom and bust, they have extraordinarily high, often unmet expectations of wealth and success. The pressure to succeed young and fast is complicated by the instability of careers in the digit ocracy. The king-of-the-world generation suddenly suspects the boat they're in might be the Titanic.</p><p>The editor of an online magazine based in Austin, Tex., has started a Quarterlife Crisis support group, inspired by a new book, ''Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique Challenges of Life in Your Twenties'' (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam), by two women in their 20's, Alexandra Robbins and Abby Wilner.</p><p>An e-mail desideratum making the rounds also seems inspired by the book.</p><p>''You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two,'' it reads in part. ''You see what others are doing and judge yourself a bit more than usual. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past.''</p><p>In ''Start-up.com,'' a recent documentary chronicling the rise and fall of an Internet company, one founding partner earnestly declares, ''I've got a lot to do before I'm 30!'' His plans did not include the dissolution of both his business and a lifelong friendship with his partner, precipitating a premature midlife crisis.</p><p>Dr. Marilyn Metzel, an adjunct professor of clinical psychology at the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri, said these issues are being raised by younger patients. ''What I'm seeing in my clinical practice is that all the stages of life are now being telescoped,'' she said. ''What we saw in the 50-year-old range, I now see in the 20-to-30-year-old range.''</p><p>In ''Quarterlife Crisis,'' Ms. Robbins, 25, outlined the distinction between her generation's crisis points and those of her parents' generation. ''In midlife, the panic is caused by too much stability, too much predictability, too much security,'' she said. ''With the quarterlife crisis, it's the opposite: no stability, no predictability, no certainty.'' The result, she added, is a ''cycle of intense self-doubt.''</p><p>Ms. Robbins and Ms. Wilner, 25, interviewed 100 or so people in their 20's for their book. Ms. Wilner, a Web designer (recently laid off), summarized the problem: ''People are taking longer to settle down, in terms of careers, relationships. That is a source of stress.''</p><p>The instability is confirmed by the latest census and labor data, which show that the 36.3 million Americans in their 20's are marrying later and changing jobs more frequently than their elders. The median age for marriage among men has risen to 27 from 22 a generation ago, and to 25 from 20 among women. According to unpublished data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median length of time workers in their early 20's stay in one job has shrunk by half since 1983 -- from 2.2 years then to 1.1 now.</p><p>Job-hopping and delaying marriage would appear to allow young adults more time to find themselves, but many complain this freedom has  them feeling more lost than found.</p><p>Amy Malissa, 23, was in New York a few weeks ago doing what she has been doing for the last six months: looking for work. Ms. Malissa knew that her last job, planning millennial events for the city of Philadelphia, had a built-in expiration date -- but that was fine. She wanted to keep her options open, in line with the conventional wisdom that company loyalty is dead in the new economy. A hundred-plus r&eacute;sum&eacute;s later, sent from her old room in her parents' house, that wisdom is looking overrated.</p><p>''I thought I was being smart taking a job with the freedom to turn in different directions,'' Ms. Malissa said. ''And I'm realizing maybe that was shortsighted or na&iuml;ve.''</p><p>Cynthia Steele, 27, thought she had everything figured out when she married and found gainful employment as an administrative assistant at the Pittsburgh Symphony. But she is having classic doubts about her life trajectory. ''You start wondering, Is this what I really want to do?'' she said. ''I want to have kids, but do I stay home?''</p><p>William Strauss, the author with Neil Howe of several books on generational identity, sees ''a strong historical analogue'' between 20-somethings and the 20's Lost Generation.</p>                </div>
