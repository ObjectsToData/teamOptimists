It was unclear at first just what nomadic desert dwellers could have made over the backroom battles of J. R. or the plantation sweetness of Miss Ellie, even if the open plains of Texas could at times seem as arid as the surrounding desert.</p><p>But was this any more peculiar than the international popularity of jeans and Jerry Lewis and McDonald's? Why shouldn't Bedouins, sheep farmers, hut dwellers, Tibetan monks and Indian computer programmers get in on the rambunctious fun, the way representatives of the entire ''family of man'' cheered when the aliens were vanquished in ''Independence Day''? These artifacts are, after all, the products of an unparalleled marketing apparatus, aiming for the greatest common denominator. Analyses of cultural imperialism and prescriptions for multiculturalism have become commonplace.</p><p>But why has American pop culture become so dominant? Marketing power and the prospect of amusement are insufficient explanations. The answer may lie not in the markets but in ourselves. And something clearly changed at the beginning of the 20th century. Before that, of course, Europeans tended to look at America not as a source of entertainment or enlightenment but as a vast, untamed wilderness whose inhabitants lacked all sense of manners or measure.</p><p>One intriguing example of how that situation changed is given in a recent book, ''Silent Film and the Triumph of the American Myth'' (Oxford) by Paula Marantz Cohen. Ms. Cohen, a professor of humanities at Drexel University in Philadelphia, shows that the development of the silent film ''sustained the American myth and sold it to the world.'' Though many distinguished silent films were made in Europe, by 1918 80 percent of the world's films were made in Hollywood, the first sign of American cultural dominance. (Incidentally, a weekly festival showing restored silent films will begin on Friday at the Museum of Television and Radio, 25 West 52nd Street in Manhattan.)</p>                </div>

                    <p>The importance of American influence was obvious, even at the time. In 1920, one French critic, typically intertwining scorn and envy, wrote: ''The Americans are primitive and at the same time barbarous, which accounts for the strength and vitality that they infuse into their cinema.'' The American poet Vachel Lindsay wrote in 1915 that ''our soil has no Roman coin or buried altar,'' so film could take their place, providing a ''new hieroglyphics'' for American democracy. D. W. Griffith, one of the great directors of the era, argued that silent films were associated with ''the good old American faculty of wanting to be 'shown' things.''</p><p>In Ms. Cohen's analysis, silent film developed three major preoccupations, each associated with a particular genre of silent film: the body (associated with comedy), the landscape (associated with the western) and the face (associated with melodrama). In each case, the genres tapped into distinctly American themes.</p><p>The film's image of the body, Ms. Cohen shows, was a declaration of its independence from the burdens of traditional time and space, a rebellion against even natural obligation. Harry Houdini, with his escapes and daredevil feats, demonstrated the rebellion in the flesh; he also owned a film production company and attempted futilely to become a movie star. Douglas Fairbanks, before whom the royalty of Europe deferred, was the true Houdini of the screen. He overcame all physical limitations, swooping, leaping, jesting, undercutting all pretense. Meanwhile, Buster Keaton (whose parents were friends of Houdini), paid tribute to the liberational possibilities of film itself as he demonstrated the creation of a new American identity. As for landscape, Ms. Cohen makes a good case that the silent cinema helped shape popular images of the American West. One major director of westerns, William S. Hart, created an 1,800-acre ''sound stage'' (silent, of course) that included entire ranches and towns.</p><p>Ultimately, Ms. Cohen suggests, the silent-film version of America is saturated with sensation and physical energy, playful inventiveness and human possibility. These were the same qualities associated with the great stars of the era, ranging from Mary Pickford to Rudolph Valentino, who themselves began in poverty and replicated, at least publicly, the triumphs of their characters. The same was true of the early film producers, many of whom, like Adolph Zukor, were immigrants. As the author Neal Gabler, a close observer of Hollywood, has argued, they enacted the American myth in their own reinvented lives as much as in their films.</p><p>In the era of the silent film, this vision of American life was thrown into relief; it was in sharp contrast to the still-powerful hierarchies of European cultures. The power of the vision also became clearer than it had ever been; the magic of the moving image dissolved European traditions with ease. Since then the American idea of material prosperity and individualism has become generalized. It has become associated with the nature of modernity itself.</p><p>Across the globe, as strong tribal and national ties have weakened, as it has become increasingly evident to even the least privileged nation just how much is possible and just how little has been achieved, a desire takes shape that has all the elements of the American dream. This aspiration can be accompanied by hostility and resentment, seeing America as a source of restrictions rather than the birthplace of possibilities. It can lead to doleful cultural consequences as a bland, meretricious populism displaces more subtle aspirations. But it can also lead to unprecedented attempts to embrace American ideals, even if they are never thought of as explicitly American.</p><p>This may be the source of American cultural dominance. In its various incarnations -- in music, dance, art, film and television -- American pop culture keeps reflecting the mythological themes first brought into world culture by silent film. And these themes, far from being provincial and constrained, promise a brave new world of unbounded possibility.</p><p>Photo: Playful inventiveness and energy: Buster Keaton helped mold a new American identity in his silent films, paying tribute to film itself as a liberating force.
