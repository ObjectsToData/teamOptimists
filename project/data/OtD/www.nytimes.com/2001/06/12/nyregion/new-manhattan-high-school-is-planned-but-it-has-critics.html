They have returned to the public schools after years of abandoning them, rejuvenating many elementary and middle schools. But they contend that the magnet schools do not provide the rigorous academic programs that their college-bound children are looking for.</p><p>The Board of Education's decision represents a shift in policy from nearly two decades of stressing the creation of small magnet schools, which use innovative themes to attract students from all over the city.</p><p>City and education officials said yesterday that the plan represented an acknowledgment that a middle-class constituency for public schools is growing. It also acknowledges that the school system might serve its long-term interests by cultivating  affluent families -- who can afford to move to the suburbs, if not send their children to private schools -- as well as poor families, who have no other options but public schools.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Quite frankly, sometimes people believe that in districts where students are doing O.K., we don't have to do as much. That's not true,'' C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said yesterday, announcing the agreement at a news conference with Representative Carolyn Maloney and other elected and education officials. Ms. Fields said the building could be ready by fall 2002.</p><p>But the plan, which would create a 700-student high school in a warehouse formerly leased by Sotheby's on East 76th Street between First and York Avenues, did not satisfy many of the parent leaders, who had pressed for it by holding rallies and incessantly telephoning public officials.</p><p>Several parents in the Partnership for an Upper East Side High School said the school was not nearly big enough to meet the neighborhood's needs, and they worried that important details still to be worked out -- like the borders of the area it would serve and the admissions criteria -- could end up excluding the very students it was intended to embrace.</p><p>Community School District 2 has more than 2,000 students in the eighth grade, they said, about three times the number that will be served by the new high school. If the school ends up serving all of District 2, which includes Chinatown, the Upper East Side and West Side neighborhoods like TriBeCa and Greenwich Village, it could end up admitting only a handful of students from its target Upper East Side neighborhood, parents complained.</p><p>Moreover, some parents are worried about whether the board will insist on using an admissions formula it often uses for high schools. Students entering high school are required to choose the school they want to attend, listing their choices by order of preference. In an effort to make the system equitable, the board, in many cases, restricts the number of high-achieving students who can be admitted to any single school.</p><p>Under that formula, only 16 percent of students can come from the top tier on standardized tests; 16 percent must come from the bottom tier and the rest from the middle. Some parents say this punishes children from middle-class families with educated parents, who tend to do better than average.</p><p>''I don't know if it's better than nothing,'' said Jeanne Kassler, one of the founders of the partnership, who has two sons at Public School 6, on East 81st Street.</p><p>Sarah Steiner, the mother of two children at P.S. 158, also on the Upper East Side, said she feared that the goal of creating a neighborhood school had been subverted. ''It doesn't help the community very much,'' she said. ''We're the people who are committed to public education, and living here, and nobody wants to give us the opportunity.''</p><p>Until now, efforts to create an Upper East Side high school had been bogged down in disputes over whether such a school would be implicitly racist, because it would be limited to a neighborhood that -- unlike the city as a whole -- is mainly white and mainly affluent.</p><p>Officials tried hard yesterday to deflect any implication that the new school would be elitist or exclusionary. Ms. Maloney conceded that some students in the surrounding Upper East Side neighborhood might be squeezed out, but she added: ''It used to be that parents would leave the city. Is that good for the city?''</p><p>And in a bit of political horse trading, officials coupled the announcement of the new school with an announcement that an existing small high school in the neighborhood, Life Sciences Secondary School, would also receive roughly $3.5 million from the Board of Education and the City Council to expand, build science labs and improve its curriculum. The students at Life Sciences are predominantly black and Hispanic, and many of them are from outside the neighborhood. Officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said two Board of Education members, Ninfa Segarra, the president, and Irving Hamer, the Manhattan member, had insisted on the cash infusion for Life Sciences before they would agree to a new East Side school.</p><p>Although the city has opened many small high schools over the last decade, they have special themes, like music, art or technology, that are intended to attract students from all over the city. Most of the remaining neighborhood schools have become schools of last resort, picking up students who are not motivated enough to choose a school, or who are rejected by every school they choose. In District 2, the neighborhood high schools are the Bayard Rustin High School for Humanities on West 18th and Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side, parents said.</p><p>Ms. Kassler and other leaders of the partnership had hoped to secure space in Julia Richman High School, a large traditional school building on the Upper East Side with a swimming pool and several gymnasiums. The school now houses six small schools, they said, and most of the building's students come from outside the neighborhood.</p><p>Ms. Maloney said, however, that Anthony Shorris, the deputy chancellor who negotiated the deal for a new high school, had made it clear from the outset that the Julia Richman building was not on the table because there was an aversion to disrupting existing programs.</p><p>The old Sotheby warehouse was offered as a possible site by Councilwoman Eva Moskowitz. But it cannot open next fall because it needs about $12 million in work.</p><p>Photo: A warehouse will become a high school on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Some parents who live in the neighborhood are worried that the school's admissions formula might favor students from other areas. (Frances Roberts for The New York Times)(pg.
