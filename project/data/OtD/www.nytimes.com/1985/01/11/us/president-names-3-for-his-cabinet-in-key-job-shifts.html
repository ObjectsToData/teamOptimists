    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="   President Reagan today announced the appointment of three new Cabinet officers and the shift of a top assistant to the No. 2 job in the Treasury Department.     Mr. Reagan said that he would nominate Energy Secretary Donald P. Hodel to head the Interior Department and name as his replacement John S. Herrington, the White House personnel director. His statement, made public by the White House, was expected.    He also nominated William J. Bennett, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, as the new Secretary of Education. The move was expected to ease tension and staff uncertainty over the future that arose when it was announced in November that Secretary of Education T. H. Bell would be leaving. He stepped down in mid-December.">

                    <strong>WASHINGTON, Jan. 10&mdash; </strong>
                    President Reagan today announced the appointment of three new Cabinet officers and the shift of a top assistant to the No. 2 job in the Treasury Department.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Reagan said that he would nominate Energy Secretary Donald P. Hodel to head the Interior Department and name as his replacement John S. Herrington, the White House personnel director. His statement, made public by the White House, was expected.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He also nominated William J. Bennett, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, as the new Secretary of Education. The move was expected to ease tension and staff uncertainty over the future that arose when it was announced in November that Secretary of Education T. H. Bell would be leaving. He stepped down in mid-December.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Darman Named for Treasury Post        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Reagan said he would nominate Richard G. Darman, a Presidential assistant, for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the department's No. 2 post. Mr. Darman had served as a deputy to James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff who is to become Treasury Secretary, and was instrumental in the development and execution of Administration policy as one of the President's top five aides.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The President believes that these nominees will provide exceptionally strong leadership as we enter the second term of his Administration,'' Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said in making the announcement. ''They are men of proven ability who have served in key positions within the Government. They will make a strong team even stronger.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The White House backed away from proposals to abolish the Departments of Energy and Education, a 1980 Reagan campaign pledge. Instead, Mr. Speakes said that Mr. Reagan had instructed Mr. Hodel and Mr. Herrington, upon confirmation by the Senate, to study merging the Energy and Interior departments and had told Mr. Bennett to conduct a similar review of the feasibility of eliminating the Education Department.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Strengthening Is Stressed        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Asking for the studies does not necessarily constitute a decision to eliminate or reorganize these departments,'' said Mr. Speakes, adding that funds for all three would be requested in Mr. Reagan's budget for 1986. ''The purpose of all the reorganization studies is to strengthen the management and effectiveness of our Energy, Education and Interior responsibilities.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Speakes said Mr. Reagan had decided to call for the studies at a Cabinet meeting today in which the participants discussed merging the Commerce Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a proposal made to Congress in 1983. No decision was made, Mr. Speakes said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    These changes follow Mr. Reagan's announcement Tuesday that Mr. Baker would switch jobs with Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. Several high Presidential aides have announced that they will be leaving the Administration, including Michael K. Deaver, the deputy chief of staff, and Interior Secretary William P. Clark.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Conservatives Unanswered        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But in the announcement today Mr. Reagan failed to satisfy a request by political conservatives that he name to a high-level White House post a major conservative such as Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States representative at the United Nations. The conservatives said they hoped the departure of such top White House officials as Mr. Baker and Mr. Darman would provide flexibility for Mr. Reagan in selecting a staff.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Darman, who is 41 years old, had been among the chief White House targets of conservatives who, in urging his removal, frequently criticized him as a political moderate. He has been called one of the brightest of Mr. Reagan's senior aides, especially in legislative strategy and negotiating.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Apparently, Mr. Reagan announced that he would nominate Mr. Darman, without seeking the resignation of the current deputy secretary, R. T. McNamar. Asked about Mr. Darman's nomination several hours before it was announced, Mr. McNamar told a reporter: ''They aren't going to be any decisions like that for a couple of weeks. There are just no announcements about Treasury that are pending.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    'Delighted' Darman Is Selected        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But later, in a statement, he said he indicated to Treasury Secretary Regan last fall that he wanted to return to private life in California this year. He said he was ''delighted'' with Mr. Darman's selection.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Speakes said in announcing Mr. Darman's appointment, ''We don't have a resignation, but I would judge by the time Mr. Darman's nomination is submitted to the Senate and he is confirmed there would be a vacancy in the position.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Administration officials said Wednesday that White House legislative strategists believed the best approach to winning confirmation was to submit the names of the Cabinet officials in a package. But Mr. Speakes said today that Mr. Reagan had not made the decision until now and had informed each in individual meetings this morning.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Hodel, 49, who is to succeed Mr. Clark, will be returning to the Interior Department, where he served almost two years as Secretary James G. Watt's top deputy. Environmentalists had criticized his role in developing policies that encouraged increased energy exploration through expanded coal leasing on Federal lands and offshore oil drilling.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In a statement today about his appointment, Mr. Hodel said he looked forward ''to fulfilling the responsibilities'' of serving as steward of the nation's ''treasures.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Herrington Nomination Backed        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Herrington, 45, has not held a Cabinet post and lacks a background in the energy field. But Mr. Speakes said he had been a ''longtime member of the Reagan team.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''He knows the President's policies and desires and he has served effectively in the White House and the Department of Defense,'' the White House spokesman said. ''And he's a specialist in personnel, administration and organization and he brings to the Energy Department a combination of the knowledge of defense and civilian management and organization.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Bennett Nomination a Surprise        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The selection of Mr. Bennett, 41, was the only surprise, although he and John R. Sibler, the president of Boston University, had been termed the leading candidates by White House officials. Mr. Bennett had the support of conservatives who had been hostile to Mr. Bell. Education lobbyists pushed for the appointment of Albert Quie, a former Minnesota governor and congressman.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The merger of the Energy and Interior departments seemed to gain momentum amid reports in recent days that it was under consideration. But such a step was expected to face a number of obstacles, including a lukewarm reception from some key members of Congress.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Asked today if that was a factor in Mr. Reagan's decision for studies of the matter, Mr. Speakes said, ''I think these are important functions that are performed by these two departments and the President wished to have an opportunity to have a fresh look at them.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Administration, after a similar study that Mr. Reagan called for concerning the Education Department, recommended in 1981 that the department's function be shifted to an independent agency. The proposal ran into opposition on Capitol Hill, including criticism from Republicans.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    White House aides have been developing an overall reorganization plan for the second Reagan term that would streamline some departments and agencies by shifting responsibilities to others. Mr. Speakes acknowledged today that one aspect of the proposal under consideration was to combine the Bureau of Reclamations and the Army Corps of Engineers and to eliminate the Council on Environmental Quality. No final decision has been made, he said.        </p>
