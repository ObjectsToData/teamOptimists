    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  J. Willard Marriott, who transformed a tiny root beer stand in Washington into the Marriott Corporation, a $3 billion lodging and food service empire, died Tuesday night, apparently of a heart attack, at Huggins Hospital in Wolfeboro, N.H., near his summer residence. He was 84 years old and lived in Washington.   Mr. Marriott, known as a deeply religious man, gave 10 percent of his income to his church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which he was active all his life. He was a generous philanthropist and supporter of Republican political causes and candidates, among them Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, John B. Connally, the former Texas Governor, and George Romney, former Governor of Michigan, a fellow Mormon.   Mr. Marriott started his nine-stool root beer stand in the nation's capital on May 20, 1927, the day that Charles A. Lindbergh began his flight across the Atlantic. Mr. Marriott invested $500 in savings in the stand, which he called the Hot Shoppe.">

                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A half-century later that original investment had grown into a far-flung diversified business that included 143 hotels and 1,700 restaurants, an airline catering service, entertainment parks, cruise ships, travel services and food service management operations for businesses and institutions. The corporation had 109,400 employees; what it did not operate itself was franchised.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The corporation now has 140,000 employees in 26 countries and operates 1,400 restaurants, primarily Roy Rogers Restaurants and Big Boy's coffee shops. It operates 143 hotels and resorts in 95 cities, but has sold its entertainment parks. In its airline catering division, Marriott operates 90 flight kitchens serving more than 150 airlines worldwide. In 1984, Marriott's annual sales reached more than $3.5 billion.        </p>

                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    At the time of his death, Mr. Marriott was chairman of the board of the corporation. His first son, J. Willard Marriott Jr. of Chevy Chase, Md., has been president of the corporation since 1964 and chief executive officer since 1972. His other son, Richard E. Marriott of Potomac, Md., was also a senior executive in the corporation.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A six-footer who did not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages, Mr. Marriott, in his early years, worked 18 hours and more a day. ''No person can get very far in this life on 40 hours a week,'' he once observed.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A few years ago, at the opening of the Westchester Marriott in Tarrytown, N.Y., Mr. Marriott, then 81, remarked: ''People ask me how I can sleep with all the company's operations. I tell them I sleep like a baby.'' He paused, then added, ''Waking up every half-hour to cry.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Marriott served as chairman of the Presidential inaugural committees at the Nixon inaugurations in 1969 and 1973.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As the Watergate scandals developed, Jeb Stuart Magruder, a former White House aide who was reported preparing to plead guilty and bear witness against other Nixon aides, was put on the inaugural committee payroll by Mr. Marriott.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    One Man's Sense of Fairness        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In an interview with The Washington Post, Mr. Marriott did not comment on the political paradox of Mr. Magruder's being sustained by one part of the Nixon circle while reportedly preparing to attack another. Instead, Mr. Marriott said of Mr. Magruder, then a 38-year-old father of four:        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''He's got a right to earn a living, to feed his family. He hasn't been convicted of anything yet. He has no income and can't live on nothing. He's down and out, and he's got a right to work. It's none of the newspaper's business.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This sense of fairness extended to other areas, often in advance of accepted opinion. In June of 1960, for example, Mr. Marriott's Hot Shoppe restaurants in Arlington, Va., opened their doors to blacks, the first well-known restaurant chain to abandon the color line in Virginia. The move was greeted with jubilation at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, then taking place in St. Paul.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In 1973, Mr. Marriott became something of a hero to nonsmokers when he set apart an entire floor of rooms in three of his hotels in Washington for them. The American Hotel and Motel Association said the hotels were the first to offer such a haven.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Town Named for Family        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    John Willard Marriott was born Sept. 17, 1900, in Marriott, Utah, the second of eight children of Ellen and Hyrum Marriott, a sheep and cattle rancher. His great-grandfather, John Marriott, went West with the Mormon migration in 1847 and established the town, near Ogden, that bears the family name.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    By the time he was a teen-ager he was wearing cowboy clothing that was not a costume and carrying a pistol that was not a toy as he helped tend his father's flocks and herds. When he was only 14 his father entrusted him with a trainload of sheep to Omaha, and from then on he grew in independence.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He served the obligatory two years as a Mormon missionary before he turned 20, traveling in New England. When he returned to Utah, he worked his way through Weber State College and the University of Utah because his father's ranching business had fallen on hard times. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1926.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The next year, when he started his first Hot Shoppe in Washington, he married his college sweetheart, Alice Taylor Sheets, the daughter of a leading Salt Lake City lawyer who was also a Mormon bishop. She helped him with his business and became an officer and director of the company.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    By 1932, with seven Hot Shoppes in the capital and the company incorporated under that name, Mr. Marriott began an expansion of the small chain outside Washington. A year later he collapsed with a disease of the lymphatic system and his doctors gave him two years to live.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Confounding the Doctors        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He spent six months fishing, hunting and riding in Maine and Florida, then confounded his physicians by not only returning to his business but expanding it. Mr. Marriott started his airline catering service in 1937 at the old Hoover National Airport, now the site of the Pentagon.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    By the end of World War II, Mr. Marriott's restaurants were dotting the turnpikes from New York to Florida and points west. In 1952, the stock of the Hot Shoppes Corporation was offered to the public.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Five years later, in 1957, Mr. Marriott opened his first motel, the Marriott Twin Bridges Motor Hotel in Washington. A decade later, the corporate name was changed to the Marriott Corporation and shortly thereafter its stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On its 50th anniversary, in 1977, the company passed the billion-dollar sales mark.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Marriott held honorary Doctor of Law degrees from Brigham Young University and the University of Utah and an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Weber State College. The 23,000-seat Marriott Activities Center at Brigham Young University and the Marriott Library at the University of Utah were financed with contributions from Mr. Marriott.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Besides his wife and two sons, Mr. Marriott is survived by three brothers, Paul, of Washington and Bal Harbour, Fla.; Woodrow, of Washington and Russell, of Kensington, Md.; three sisters, Kaye Kausholz of Chevy Chase; Eva Candland of Mesa, Ariz., and Helen Dougan of Salt Lake City; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Funeral services are to be held Saturday at the Washington Stake Center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kensington, Md. Burial will be held at Parklawn Cemetery in Rockville, Md.        </p>
