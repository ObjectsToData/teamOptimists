    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  FRANK RODRIGUEZ has spent the last few weeks developing an employee-attitude questionnaire that he will use in his department at the American Express Company to uncover any morale problems. Surveys like his are not uncommon in large corporations, but what is unusual is that Mr. Rodriguez is conducting the research to meet an academic requirement in a novel undergraduate business program.    Mr. Rodriguez is a student at the College for Human Services in New York City, a 400-student professional- studies college with an ususual approach. Like his 15 classmates in the new business program there, he works full time and also takes a full load of classes. Each term, in addition to his class assignments, he must undertake a term project involving his workplace like the one he is working on now, which the school calls a ''constructive action.''">

                    FRANK RODRIGUEZ has spent the last few weeks developing an employee-attitude questionnaire that he will use in his department at the American Express Company to uncover any morale problems. Surveys like his are not uncommon in large corporations, but what is unusual is that Mr. Rodriguez is conducting the research to meet an academic requirement in a novel undergraduate business program.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Rodriguez is a student at the College for Human Services in New York City, a 400-student professional- studies college with an ususual approach. Like his 15 classmates in the new business program there, he works full time and also takes a full load of classes. Each term, in addition to his class assignments, he must undertake a term project involving his workplace like the one he is working on now, which the school calls a ''constructive action.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Constructive actions, like Mr. Rodriguez's research, are designed to meet a genuine need, explained Barbara L. Smyth, assistant dean for education at the college. They also provide students with an opportunity to apply the skills they learned during the term.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''We have turned education right side up,'' said Audrey Cohen, the institution's president. ''We have enabled our students to blend theory and practice, which cannot be done in a traditional school of higher education. With work-study,'' she went on, ''you do a job and may or may not take a course that relates to it. We're building an entirely different system. Instead of starting with a piece of knowledge, we begin with a purpose. We focus on eight areas we think an individual needs to know to succeed in a service economy.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    These eight areas make up the core of what the college calls the ''crystal curriculum.'' In the 1970's, according to Miss Cohen, the school's faculty identified eight skills, or ''crystals,'' such as research and communication and personal development. For each of the three terms per year, students take five multidisciplinary courses - skills, systems, self and others, values and ethics, and purpose - that bear directly on the crystal on which they are focusing at the moment. The crystals change each term, and by graduation a student has studied all eight crystals from the five courses' vantage points.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For example, Mr. Rodriguez's crystal this term is research and communication. His values class draws on history, philosophy and humanities sources to teach ethics of communication. The course called Self and Others uses psychology and learning theory to teach students about personal communications. In his skills course he studies marketing research.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The college was founded in 1964 as the Women's Talent Corps, a federally financed training program. It adopted its present name in 1967 and three years later first offered an associate degree. Now it offers a bachelor's degree in professional or career-skills studies that was accredited by the New York State Board of Regents in 1979, as well as a part-time work-study program for 63 junior high school students in East Harlem, and is ''really looking at education from a totally different angle,'' said Miss Cohen. ''We first ask, 'What do we want our students to be?' '' she said. ''Then we focus on subjects that will help them become that.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In recent years, educators and business professionals have criticized traditional business- school curriculums. They contend that the students do not learn the practical skills they need to succeed in business.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Graduates often are too theoretical and shortsighted, said Jack N. Behrman, associate dean for academic programs at the graduate school of business of the University of North Carolina. Students often are not taught good communications skills or how to consider a decision from a variety of perspectives. ''There also is a lack of ethical understanding of the system,'' he said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The business program at the College for Human Services attacks these problems by applying a multidisciplinary curriculum to teach specific skills, Miss Cohen said. ''There is no way to consistently connect theory and practice in the old system,'' she said. ''The only way you can do this is by focusing on purpose.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The students, most of whom are low-level managers who need a college degree to advance, said they found the curriculum both interesting and practical. ''I came here because I needed the business education,'' said Keith Ambarado, from New York City. ''I don't have any financial background, and I do a lot of writing.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Students come here because they can get a bachelor's degree in two years and nine months,'' said Miss Smyth, the assistant dean. This is possible because the college offers a complete curriculum during the summer session. ''They also like the idea of being able to apply the knowledge at work,'' she said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    STUDENTS also said they liked being able to work and go to school full time. Even those who could afford to stop working wanted to remain on their jobs, where they gain valuable experience. Eventually, the college would like to provide job placement services to prospective students.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''We're not just learning obscure book knowledge here,'' said Bernadette Rude, also from New York, a student who works for the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. ''It's all very relevant. I don't foresee anything I won't be able to apply.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''They say that when you complete a crystal you will never think and act the same way again,'' said Mr. Rodriguez. ''I thought it was a sales pitch, but they were right.'' He said even his supervisor noticed an improvement in his business and personal skills.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    While no one will be graduated from the business program, which was instituted in September 1983, until the summer of 1986, students, faculty members and business professionals interviewed are optimistic that the knowledge and skills learned at the college will produce a more well-rounded and open-minded business person.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''I think they are going to be very well-trained people because their curriculum gives them hard-core, nitty-gritty business tools,'' said John Hoyt Stookey, president of National Distillers and Chemical Corporation, who is a member of the college's business advisory committee.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Today you either have a degree and no experience or you have experience and no degree,'' said Miss Rude, who will soon complete her fourth crystal. ''But I'll have both.''        </p>
