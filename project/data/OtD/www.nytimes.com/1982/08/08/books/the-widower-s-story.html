    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="AUTUMN By A.G. Mojtabai.  140 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. $9.95.   DRIVING alone in the evening, returning from a trip, liking the idea of the family meal ahead, I have been attacked once or twice in my time by melodrama. Thoughts regarding the nature of aloneness.  Reflections on what it would be like to know, as one drove, that the house up the road had necessarily to be empty. Turning the radio back on and listening again to the first-round golf scores from somewhere sets the mind on a better course, but there's still a bit of unease.  Certainly you forget quickly the names of the players who didn't make the cut. A.G. Mojtabai's fourth novel speaks with force and clarity to the sort of unease I mention. A short, quiet-voiced tale, it describes a few days in the life of a recently widowed 66-year-old accountant named Will Ross - a man under pressure to move out of the Maine seacoast cottage he and his wife had imagined, during 20 years of summer vacations, as their probable retirement home. The key to the book's value lies in its alertness to the varieties of feeling awakened in those newly alone.">

                    DRIVING alone in the evening, returning from a trip, liking the idea of the family meal ahead, I have been attacked once or twice in my time by melodrama. Thoughts regarding the nature of aloneness.  Reflections on what it would be like to know, as one drove, that the house up the road had necessarily to be empty. Turning the radio back on and listening again to the first-round golf scores from somewhere sets the mind on a better course, but there's still a bit of unease.  Certainly you forget quickly the names of the players who didn't make the cut. A.G. Mojtabai's fourth novel speaks with force and clarity to the sort of unease I mention. A short, quiet-voiced tale, it describes a few days in the life of a recently widowed 66-year-old accountant named Will Ross - a man under pressure to move out of the Maine seacoast cottage he and his wife had imagined, during 20 years of summer vacations, as their probable retirement home. The key to the book's value lies in its alertness to the varieties of feeling awakened in those newly alone.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    At one moment - during an outbreak of intense sexual heat - Mrs.  Mojtabai's widowed hero has a sudden, fresh comprehension of what it means to be utterly free and experiences aloneness as thrilling independence. At other moments, talking aloud to his departed mate in her garden shed or in the kitchen, or asking if by chance she heard the weather on television, Ross is hazy about where his mind stops and his wife's begins, incapable of grasping that he is actually by himself. The novelist moves with the feeling, wherever it leads, stands inside it catching its weather, making one sense the currents, the back eddies of loneliness. It seemed to me at times, reading ''Autumn,'' that no one I had previously read had been as patient or keen or unsentimental as Mrs. Mojtabai about the matter of loss.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The pressures endured by the widower in this book are perfectly ordinary. Ross has a married son in his mid-30's who lives in Texas, believes that his father can't possibly survive a winter by himself on the coast of Maine and calls up every Sunday after the rate change to hound the old man out of his house. In addition, there is an amorous widow who's attracted to Ross, believes that he will shortly forget his wife as she has forgotten her dead husband and presses Ross to skip south with her to Florida sun and fun.  Ross handles these pressures well, in my view. He is rude to his son and daughter-in-law, mocking, for instance, their selfcongratulating decision against having children (''I forgot - you have dogs instead''). He accepts the amorous widow's sexual advances but rejects the sun and fun. The closely related principles guiding his mind appear to be, first, that, since staying on in the seaside house was the plan he and his wife had settled on together, it has substance that other behavior must lack; second, that happiness in Florida amid throngs of cheery shuffleboarders is a mode of unreality; third, that the least comfort is somehow the best.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    AFTER Ross's wife goes, a well-intentioned preacher leaves him ''a little directory ... little index, how to look up the right psalm for the right sorrow: in danger, God seems distant, friends fail you and the like.'' Ross reports that he ''went at it hard for two, three days, then quit.'' It emerged that the only thing he liked in the Scripture line was a verse from the Book of Kings -''not the words so much as what they made me think of: 'Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.' I liked that one, always have; it doesn't insist on anything, doesn't harp.'' (Lovers of I Kings will try mentally to push Ross forward a verse or two to the ''still small voice,'' but ''Autumn'' is an astringent work; Ross stops at the hand.)        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    I wish to say that, despite the occasional patch of personal, absurd, on-the-road melodramatics I referred to above, I was not initially well disposed toward this novel. Books that establish themselves, in their opening pages, as inquiries into grief deserve to be resisted; they resemble street beggars, assuming sympathy instead of earning it. When Mrs. Mojtabai's widower decides to go out for a restaurant meal to see whether this will help and the waitress tries to clear away the other place setting, Ross cries out: ''Leave it, leave it!'' ''Why can't they leave it be,'' he wonders angrily.  ''I wouldn't use two forks.'' Looking at the other people in the room staring at him, he thinks: ''Take a good look: this could happen to you.'' Obviously such a passage sets a tide of feeling running in the reader, but I stood it off properly.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    It was the same when, during a spell of bad weather in the story, Ross says aloud to his wife, ''It's raining out ... you aren't missing a thing.'' And very nearly the same during the scene - a very mysterious scene, simultaneously amusing and unbearable - of coupling with the amorous widow. Ross has a sense of his wife ''not far off, looking over my shoulder, listening in. She isn't wishing me ill, she isn't cheering me on, she's just curious. I know I would be.'' Some minutes later he brings himself to utter his wife's name as though casually, in a sentence spoken to the widow, and feels at once - naturally - that he's committed treachery. ''There! I've said it. ... I don't feel any better for it, just small, cheap.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    GRADUALLY, though, it sinks in that in resisting this story - fighting it, really - one is doing the author's own bidding. Her spiky, defiant hero never once weeps, and Mrs. Mojtabai herself clearly has a profound conviction of the moral rightness of reserve.  What is the good of anything else? her tone insists. What can be the purpose of self-display? Toward the end, during a hospital scene of terrible beauty, resistance crumbles. But even then, tear-blinded, one feels the author's grave unfeigned disapproval of such weakness.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Autumn'' has some flaws. The visitor, real or fantasized, who takes up residence in a tree house on Ross's property late in the novel provides a note of mystery that's more distracting than enriching, I think. As readers of Mrs. Mojtabai's earlier novels will remember, this is an author who makes do with the simplest narrative line - no hint of page-turning suspense. A few idioms in the book and a few social details struck me as shaky. But I doubt many readers will finish the novel thinking about flaws. What I myself did afterward was go back over the work admiringly, turning the pages slowly, on the theory that the fight was finished, that I had toughed it out and could now apply myself coolly to study of the craft. (The theory proved false.) People who care about the absolutely genuine in art and life will not wish to miss A.G. Mojtabai's ''Autumn.''        </p>
