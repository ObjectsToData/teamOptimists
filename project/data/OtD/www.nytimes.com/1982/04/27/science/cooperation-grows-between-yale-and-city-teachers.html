    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  THE Gothic stone walls that buffer the campus of Yale University from the rough and tumble city of New Haven, barriers that often seem psychological as much as physical, are becoming increasingly less forbidding to at least one group: local public schoolteachers.   An ambitious program, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, bridges the gulf by allowing about 80 teachers a year to work with Yale professors in developing curriculum units to take back to the city's public schools.   ''The attitude of teachers has changed and Yale is no longer seen as an ivory tower separated from New Haven,'' said Linda J. Maynard, a social studies teacher at the Hamden-New Haven Cooperative Education Center, a public school that operates in a nontraditional manner.   The program, which starts every March and continues with weekly meetings until the end of July, provides courses - known as seminars -in which groups of eight to 14 teachers gather with a senior professor. The subjects of the seminars are determined in advance by a panel of teachers who consult with their colleagues in the school system to identify areas of mutual concern.">

An ambitious program, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, bridges the gulf by allowing about 80 teachers a year to work with Yale professors in developing curriculum units to take back to the city's public schools.   ''The attitude of teachers has changed and Yale is no longer seen as an ivory tower separated from New Haven,'' said Linda J. Maynard, a social studies teacher at the Hamden-New Haven Cooperative Education Center, a public school that operates in a nontraditional manner.   The program, which starts every March and continues with weekly meetings until the end of July, provides courses - known as seminars -in which groups of eight to 14 teachers gather with a senior professor.

                    ''The attitude of teachers has changed and Yale is no longer seen as an ivory tower separated from New Haven,'' said Linda J. Maynard, a social studies teacher at the Hamden-New Haven Cooperative Education Center, a public school that operates in a nontraditional manner.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The program, which starts every March and continues with weekly meetings until the end of July, provides courses - known as seminars -in which groups of eight to 14 teachers gather with a senior professor. The subjects of the seminars are determined in advance by a panel of teachers who consult with their colleagues in the school system to identify areas of mutual concern.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In reaching out to the surrounding public schools, Yale is making a gesture that many educators say ought to occur more frequently.  Colleges and universities have a high stake in improving the academic preparation of young people who will eventually be their students.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Nothing made this interdependence more apparent than the spread of remedial studies for incoming freshmen in the 1970's. There is now more interest than ever before in seeking avenues of cooperation; the huge City University of New York, for instance, is involved in 128 individual projects with public, private and parochial schools.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Yet the gulf that divides elementary and secondary education from higher education is not easily crossed. A long history of poor relationships still separates those who teach in colleges and universities and those who teach in the public schools.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''There is a continuum from secondary school to college that Americans have tended to ignore, creating a kind of gap that shouldn't be there,'' said Howard R. Lamar, dean of Yale College and a founder of the institute. ''What is very important now is an awareness of the role that a university can play in a public school system.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The teachers' institute at Yale, formed in 1978 and supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science Foundation and other sources, is emerging as one of the better examples of cooperation between a school system and a university. The program grew out of a project for history teachers that began in 1970, and in 1980 was cited as a model by the National Commission on the Humanities.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This spring, the institute expects to provide six separate series of seminars, all for secondary schoolteachers. Its aims are far more practical than a simple addition to the teachers' theoretical knowledge. Besides listening to lectures, reading books and engaging in discussions, each participant prepares a curriculum unit to present to his or her classes the following year over a period of two to eight weeks. Teacher Is Aided by Seminar        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For example, Ben Gorman, a teacher at Fair Haven Middle School, introduced into one of his courses this year a sequence of lessons on trees and their function in the life of the city. He prepared the lessons last year in connection with a seminar on the environment that lent itself to many possible lesson plans.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Ongoing curriculum development is important and the institute is a way of doing this,'' said Mr. Gorman. ''People in New Haven have always had some access to Yale, but there was nothing like this in which professors and teachers worked closely together in ways that have an impact on the public school students.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Program participants, or fellows as they are called, have the opportunity to become members of the university community. They are listed in the Yale directory and enjoy privileges in the libraries and other facilities. This is no small matter for public schoolteachers, so many of whom are accustomed to few amenities. The program is free to the teachers, who are paid $500 for their participation.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''It's nice to get away for a while from the realities of urban poverty and the problems of secondary schools,'' said Miss Maynard.  A recent survey of the former fellows showed that almost half were influenced in their decisions to remain as schoolteachers in New Haven by their experience in the institute.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Another useful product of the institute has been the continuing relationships formed between some of the New Haven teachers and members of the Yale faculty. The teachers can turn to the professors for suggestions and ideas long after the seminars have been completed.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Most of the people I taught a year ago are still in touch with me,'' said Robin W. Winks, a Yale history professor. ''Whether we will still be in touch five years from now, I don't know.'' Planning to Lead 2 Seminars        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dr. Winks has been so pleased with his seminars that this year he is leading two: ''Society and the Detective Novel'' and ''An Unstable World: The West in Decline.'' Seminar assignments are in addition to the regular schedules of Yale professors and they receive extra pay.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Another Yale professor, Robert M. Cover of the law school, is leading a seminar on ''The Constitution in American History and American Life.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Among the subjects on which teachers hope to develop curriculum units from this seminar are the treatment of Japanese-Americans in World War II, the effects of urban law on families, the procedures of a criminal trial and the question whether equality can be legislated.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The value of the institute, which is directed by James R. Vivian, a Yale official, does not seem limited to the schoolteachers, many of whom repeatedly participate in the program. Professors maintain that they are forced to think anew about their subject matter, knowing that it has to be recast in ways that can be passed on to students in high schools and junior highs.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The seminars help me grow as a teacher,'' said Dr. Winks.  ''Furthermore, I've learned about the practical problems of teaching in high school. People who have been in what some call 'the real world,' have a different perspective on learning and it's nice to be teaching them.''        </p>
