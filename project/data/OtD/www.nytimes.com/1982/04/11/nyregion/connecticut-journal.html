    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  THIS would be the year, David Holahan thought, that everyone would see the annual April Fools' Day joke in his newspapers for the baldfaced tomfoolery it was. After all, he reasoned, who would believe a front-page story ''By John Reed'' that The Gazette and The Compass, which serve the Old Lyme and Mystic area, had been bought by Tass, the Soviet press agency?   Who, indeed. Mr. Holahan last week described three true believers among his readers.  One Mystic resident called the office of The Compass to say that she wasn't surprised the paper, which she already considered to harbor left-wing tendencies, had been bought by Communists. A receptionist tried to assure the woman the story was a joke. ''That's just what you would say,'' the woman rejoined.   A man called The Compass to ask how - as the story reported - Mr.  Holahan and his co-publisher, Chip Bates, had been killed after Tass bought their paper in ''separate but simultaneous hunting accidents,'' shooting themselves in the back of their heads with ''standard-issue Soviet Army rifles.'' Again, the receptionist deflated the caller; this one accepted that he had been fooled.">

                    THIS would be the year, David Holahan thought, that everyone would see the annual April Fools' Day joke in his newspapers for the baldfaced tomfoolery it was. After all, he reasoned, who would believe a front-page story ''By John Reed'' that The Gazette and The Compass, which serve the Old Lyme and Mystic area, had been bought by Tass, the Soviet press agency?        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Who, indeed. Mr. Holahan last week described three true believers among his readers.  One Mystic resident called the office of The Compass to say that she wasn't surprised the paper, which she already considered to harbor left-wing tendencies, had been bought by Communists. A receptionist tried to assure the woman the story was a joke. ''That's just what you would say,'' the woman rejoined.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A man called The Compass to ask how - as the story reported - Mr.  Holahan and his co-publisher, Chip Bates, had been killed after Tass bought their paper in ''separate but simultaneous hunting accidents,'' shooting themselves in the back of their heads with ''standard-issue Soviet Army rifles.'' Again, the receptionist deflated the caller; this one accepted that he had been fooled.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    And, finally, a reader who is a friend of Mr. Bates's family called The Gazette to offer her condolences on his death.  Mr. Holahan had considered the Tass ruse too unbelievable to attract the acceptance accorded two previous April Fools' Day stories: a 1981 article that The Gazette was being sold to Walter Cronkite and Charles Kuralt (reported, then retracted, by The New York Post); and the 1980 story that The Gazette had purchased The New London Day, a nearby daily newspaper (reported by The New England Printer and Publisher).        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    About 20 callers did recognize this year's story for the joke that it was, Mr. Holahan said. But for the handful who could not tell the difference between fact and fantasy, he offered an idea for April Fools' Day, 1982.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''We may sell out,'' he said, ''to some people from the planet Pluto.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    What began simply as a support group for WYRS-FM, the all-jazz radio station based in Stamford, has become a force critical of the station's direction.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Friends of WYRS organized late last year to convince the incoming owners of the station to retain jazz programming. The new management, headed by Alphonsus Donahue Jr., took over in March and did keep WYRS as the only full-time, commercial jazz station in metropolitan New York.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But the group now says that the station has embraced a softer form of jazz, which one member called ''one step above elevator music.'' The flames were fanned by an inaccurate news report that WYRS had begun playing music by Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand, and by an ill-worded statement by Ronald M. Gilbert, WYRS's new general manager, that WYRS would play less ''improvisational'' jazz - a contradiction because jazz is, by definition, largely improvised.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    What has, in fact, changed is this: WYRS has dropped its jazz education and audience participation shows, playing instead about 25 more songs daily. And there are indications that the station is playing more ballads during daytime hours, in hopes of solidifying its commercial appeal.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But both jazz musicians and Rick Petrone, the program and production supervisor and the creator of many of the canceled WYRS features, claim the station remains pure jazz.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''In many instances we are playing the shorter version of a cut,'' said Mr. Petrone. ''But that way we can play more cuts. We've proven we can educate. Now we want to prove we can sustain a jazz radio station. That means we have to go through a transition period. What people forget often is that we're a commercial station.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Politicians are often asked to kiss babies, taste ethnic foods and wear funny hats. But where is it written that a politician must pose with a pig? Recently, Governor O'Neill was asked to do just that, and he complied with only a hint of reluctance.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As part of a promotion, the Connecticut affiliate of the American Diabetes Association asked the Governor to take part in a photo session on the State Capitol lawn, along with some children who have diabetes - and a 3 1/2-week-old piglet.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The children wore T-shirts that read: ''Pigs Are Precious.'' The pig pancreas is valuable in the manufacture of insulin, a substance used to aid diabetes sufferers.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The piglet was owned by the University of Connecticut's animal industries department. The Governor eyed the little creature warily before the ceremony, and noted that it ''resembles a few people I know.'' Mr. O'Neill did not elaborate.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As the piglet's handlers prepared the animal for the picture-taking session, the Governor wondered aloud about its behavior, saying: ''I've got to go to Danbury tonight, and I don't want to have to go home to change.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But the children from the American Diabetes Association held the piglet. The Governor was asked simply to join them in the photo, which he did.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The piglet - not actually a part of diabetes research - was returned to the university. Judging from the animal's noisy behavior, the session with publicity photographers and a politician was just about all the social commitment this little piglet could take.        </p>
