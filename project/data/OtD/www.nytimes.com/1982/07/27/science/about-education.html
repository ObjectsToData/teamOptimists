    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  TELEVISION has conquered America, but last month it suffered two stinging defeats in higher education. The University of Mid-America, a Middle Western consortium of universities that attempts to improve opportunities for off-campus adult education, announced it has had to abandon extensive plans for a nationwide American Open University and that it would end its own operation by Sept. 30.   At about the same time, CBS and New York University announced they would discontinue ''Sunrise Semester,'' the televised college course on which some of the university's most distinguished professors reached a pre-breakfast home audience of credit and noncredit students over the last 25 years.   Explaining the fate of the open university, Donald R. McNeil, U.M.A.'s president, said: ''It's too bad that the National Institute of Education provided about $4 million to develop and refine the concept of the A.O.U. and then wouldn't give us the last million and a half as seed money to get us up and going. However, that is life and we'll have to wait until some visionary millionaire takes over the idea.''">

                    TELEVISION has conquered America, but last month it suffered two stinging defeats in higher education.

                    At about the same time, CBS and New York University announced they would discontinue ''Sunrise Semester,'' the televised college course on which some of the university's most distinguished professors reached a pre-breakfast home audience of credit and noncredit students over the last 25 years.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Explaining the fate of the open university, Donald R. McNeil, U.M.A.'s president, said: ''It's too bad that the National Institute of Education provided about $4 million to develop and refine the concept of the A.O.U. and then wouldn't give us the last million and a half as seed money to get us up and going. However, that is life and we'll have to wait until some visionary millionaire takes over the idea.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As for ''Sunrise Semester,'' CBS said that last year only 42 of its approximately 200 affiliated stations carried the program and only 47 students were enrolled for credit.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The open university concept was inspired by the British Open University, started 11 years ago with government financing, the expertise of the British Broadcasting Corporation and a large fulltime faculty. The instructors not only develop radio and television programs and extensive textbooks for home study but also run a system of remote-control homework and examinations with the help of computers and tutors.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The British program has reached hundreds of thousands. Last year, it admitted 21,000 new degree-seeking students and, for budgetary reasons, had to turn away 15,000 applicants. In its first 10 years, it has had a graduation rate of nearly 60 percent, more than 10 percentage points higher than America's on-campus colleges.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In 1979, the American Open University began to conduct in-depth feasibility studies and obtained the approval of the University of Mid-America trustees for plans to establish a nationwide independent degree-granting institution of higher learning. Preparations included surveying existing correspondence courses, telecourses and computeraided instruction; hiring a staff with academic expertise, and assembling two sets of advisory faculties - in the arts and sciences, and in business.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''These efforts resulted in a fully developed conceptual plan for the American Open University and a specific two-volume business plan to back it up,'' Mr. McNeil said. However, rejection of further financing by the National Institute of education has dashed all hopes for further operations.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    What went wrong with the American Open University and ''Sunrise Semester''?  In the case of the CBS-N.Y.U. venture, the answer appears to be that the network ran the program for some years with what even casual viewers saw clearly as a minimal investment in production. The most eloquent teachers could not overcome those limitations, and the university did not always provide the compelling lecturers who gave the program glamour and substance in its early years. At any rate, on-camera lectures, without visual and production support, make for dull education. In addition, the early-morning slot, once viewed as expendable, has since become profitable for news.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The reasons for the American Open University failure are more complex. David Blackburn, director of the New York-based British Open University Foundation, said: ''To make it work you have to have academics who put their reputation on the line full time. You have to be able to defend the university as a whole, not just single courses.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    An American expert in televised higher education said the plan had been conceived and administered primarily by television people. He said he felt they had been too involved with ''random TV courses'' and with the creation of a separate institution, apart from existing campuses.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Other experts have long been convinced that while television can make a contribution to higher education, the British concept could not be readily exported to the United States for one obvious reason: In Britain, with its limited access to traditional campuses, there is a huge backlog of people for whom the open university is the only chance to gain a college education; in the United States, with its mass college attendance, such a backlog, if it exists, is small.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In addition, higher education at the moment is actually overbuilt and therefore does not look kindly on any off-campus competition for scarce students. Institutions will cooperate with planners of a televised curriculum only if they can retain control over students and tuition.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Educators who failed to overcome these obstacles nevertheless refuse to accept the defeat as final. They view the open university as an idea whose time in America has not yet come. ''Those of us who shared this dream are deeply disappointed,'' Mr. McNeil said, ''but we strongly believe that some time in the next decade an American Open University will be created.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Meanwhile, a different, more modest form of open university is doing well in the United States. The National University Consortium, financed in part by the Carnegie Corporation, began operations in the fall of 1980. Based on a pilot program begun at the University of Maryland in 1972, it now is located at that institution's Center for Public Broadcasting.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Instead of functioning as an independent national university, the consortium makes its arrangements with local colleges and public television stations. Students enroll on the participating campus, pay tuition and are subject to that college's academic controls. The consortium provides the televised programs and study materials, many of them adapted from the British Open University, which gets $15 in royalties per student enrolled in each course. The college pays the consortium a membership fee of $10,000 a year plus $35 per course taken by each student.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The consortium's secret, says Dr. Alan Hershfield, its director, is that it acts primarily as a service organization. It negotiates with the British, develops curricula and designs courses, but it always leaves the faculties of the colleges in charge.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    At present, 17 colleges and 23 television stations are part of the consortium. Last year, 1,500 students were enrolled for credit, up from 900 the year before, and 2,000 are expected this fall. The goal is 30,000 students with 100 colleges participating.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    It offers three curriculums - the behavioral and social sciences; the humanities, and systems management for business and public administration. Science is to be added next.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dr. Hershfield is convinced that the consortium is on the right track because it is committed to a slow and cost-effective buildup, tight quality control and a partnership with the existing world of academe. While its eyes are on the future, it is careful not to frighten those who must worry about survival now - the campuses who don't want to lose their students to the electronic competition.        </p>
