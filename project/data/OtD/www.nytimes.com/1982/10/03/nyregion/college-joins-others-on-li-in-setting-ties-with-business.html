    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  OLD WESTBURY CREATED 14 years ago as an experimental campus, designed to encourage the enrollment of minority and nontraditional students, the State University of New York's College at Old Westbury is taking steps to broaden its student base and create more contact with the Island's business and cultural commmunity.   ''We've become isolated here through the rhetoric of our past,'' said Dr. Clyde J. Wingfield, who since assuming the presidency of Old Westbury about 100 days ago has set the college on what aides describe as ''a rather dramatically different course'' from that of previous administrations.   Dr. Wingfield regards the 25 percent attrition rate, or turnover of new students, at the school to be ''excessive,'' so he has called on the Old Westbury faculty to establish tougher admissions standards for the first time in the history of the college.   The college head said it was also time for Old Westbury ''to develop bridges with the Long Island business and corporate world.'' He said that such a ''valuable and natural link'' should produce benefits for the college, its students and the Island's business community.">

                    The college head said it was also time for Old Westbury ''to develop bridges with the Long Island business and corporate world.'' He said that such a ''valuable and natural link'' should produce benefits for the college, its students and the Island's business community.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In following this course, Old Westbury is joining most of the other institutions on Long Island in trying to establish a close relationship with the business community. The president of another state university on Long Island, Dr. John H. Marburger of Stony Brook, for example, is on the board of directors of the Long Island Action Committee, which seeks to promote the Island's economic interests.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Island's private educational community, unfettered by controls at the state level, has long enjoyed such a relationship.  As a step toward opening new avenues of contact with the business community, Dr. Wingfield has established the Old Westbury Center for Management Studies, which will hold its first winter economic and business conference on the campus on Dec. 9. He said he planned to discuss there the ''mutually supportive relationship between Long Island's economy and higher education.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    These efforts are paralleled by a major change of academic orientation among the students of Old Westbury, as well as at most other schools and colleges on the Island, toward business and technical careers.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Old Westbury has traditionally had a reputation as a college with an academic program that dealt primarily with the social sciences, humanities and the arts. ''Now, however, students have made very clear their career choice is in another direction,'' said Robert J.  McVeigh, director of college relations at Old Westbury.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He said that one out of every three students who graduated from Old Westbury last June had majored in business and management.  ''Today, two-thirds of our students with declared majors have selected business, applied sciences, mathematics and computer sciences,'' he said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In an interview last week in his fourth-flour office overlooking the wooded hills of the 600-acre campus, Dr. Wingfield said that Old Westbury had operated as the only ''open-admissions'' college on the Island and that the resulting attrition and remediation problems generated by this policy had drained the college of critical financial resources.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In calling for tougher admissions standards, he said he felt that ''better prepared students must be attracted to Old Westbury.'' He said he would also like to see the present enrollment of slightly over 3,600 students, nearly 400 more than last year, expand to between 6,000 and 7,000 over the next decade.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The rhetoric of past administrations,'' he said, had referred to the special ''mission'' of Old Westbury, the recruitment and education of the ''traditionally bypassed'' students, such as blacks, Hispanic people, Asians, older women and blue-collar workers.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He stressed that while he remained in agreement with a policy of attracting these students, he believed it was necessary to attract ''better prepared'' students from these groups.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    He also said that the college had been mandated by the State University of New York board of trustees to serve two other groups - transfer students from the Island's two-year colleges and the traditional 18-year-old high school graduates.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The present student enrollment is made up of 1,803 men and 2,085 women. About 35 percent of the students are black, 8 percent are Hispanic and 3 percent are Asian. The average student age is 28, higher than at most undergraduate schools, because many of the students are older women, many of them housewives with older children who are now seeking training for a career outside the home.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Several weeks ago, Dr. Wingfield announced plans for a $6.8 million natural sciences building, which will be the last building in the campus's $85 million master plan. The three-story building is scheduled for completion in 1985 and will include facilities for biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and business and computer science courses, as well as office space for 45 instructors.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The new space, he said, was already in demand since 36 percent of the present student body is now in business administration and 26 percent in the sciences.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A few weeks ago the school librarian completed moving the last of the 150,000 volumes of the library into a new complex. The volumes include extensive collections in black studies and women's studies.  The theater in the new $12 million library-theater complex is also near completion, awaiting the installment of 400 seats.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For a New York State resident, full-time tuition at Old Westbury is $1,050 a year. A dormitory room costs $1,250 a year, and the meal plan is about $1,000 a year. On-campus facilities include housing for 650 students. About 80 percent of the students commute.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The total cost per year of attending Old Westbury ranges from $1,500 to $4,000, depending on commuter or resident status.  Out-ofstate students pay an additional $700 in tuition. Part-time students pay $35 a credit.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Efforts to change the emphasis of enrollment criteria at Old Westbury by previous administrations met tough campus resistance.  So, not surprisingly, Dr. Wingfield's efforts have renewed an old campus controversy.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Last week's issue of the student newspaper, The Catalyst, devoted much of its news coverage and editorial comment to the Wingfield plans.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The editorial said that raising admissions standards ''would curtail the original mission of the college'' and that that was ''not the way to bring in better students and decrease the attrition rate.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Improving existing programs and facilities, from bilingual education to business, and from housing to recreational, will certainly entice a larger percent of students to complete their education'' at Old Westbury, the editorial said. ''Efforts should be focused on increasing the number of cultural events, coordinating more well-planned and interesting activities, and letting students know that if they are willing to work, their 'special place' is behind them all the way.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Student Union on campus has issued a call for students to express their views at a meeting at 9 P.M. tomorrow.        </p>
