    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="ALTHOUGH he was not the first artist to paint the picturesque Hudson River Valley and the Catskills, Frederic Church was perhaps the most talented. Born in Connecticut in 1826, he studied for two years with the painter Thomas Cole, who lived in the town of Catskill. Church returned to the area 15 years later and bought a property across the river, where he built a Moorish-style castle on a bluff with a view to die for. He called it Olana.    A New York State Historic Site since the 1960's, the house and grounds are a good summer day trip from Westchester. Besides the architecture and furnishings, best described as idiosyncratic, the home contains dozens of Church's paintings and sketches. Among them are the preparatory oil sketches for ''Niagara'' and ''The Heart of the Andes,'' two of America's most famous 19th-century landscape paintings.  ">

Besides the architecture and furnishings, best described as idiosyncratic, the home contains dozens of Church's paintings and sketches. Among them are the preparatory oil sketches for ''Niagara'' and ''The Heart of the Andes,'' two of America's most famous 19th-century landscape paintings.</p><p>Olana is about to undergo major restoration, which means now is the time to visit. Supported by a $1.5 million grant from New York State and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the restoration will open up the second floor to visitors and roughly double the wall space for the display of artwork from the collection. Beginning in December, the paintings will be packed away and the house will be closed for conventional tours until around June 2006.</p><p>Aside from sketches for famous paintings, the house contains a few of Church's paintings of the area. Among them is ''Twilight Among the Mountains'' (1845), shown at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan the year it was painted. With a frozen foreground figure, it is stodgy as far as landscapes go, but it also shows the artist's early faith in the value of the sublime in art. The sublime understood as a pillar of beauty, that is. As an art term, the sublime was first used in the 18th century to describe paintings that manage to overpower or take possession of the viewer. Later it became connected to nature worship, and the depiction of scenes of such awe-inspiring beauty, intensity and grandeur (snowy peaks, sunsets, rainbows) that they fill viewers with a melancholy sense of their own insignificance. Church traveled the world in search of such vistas.</p>                </div>

                    <p>On one of his trips to Europe and the Middle East, Church discovered Moorish architecture. He was so fascinated by its hypnotic sense of purity, permanence and obvious decorative possibilities that he resolved to build a house in this style. He also resolved to design it himself, borrowing ideas from buildings seen on his travels and architectural pattern books popularly available in the 19th century.</p><p>An ensemble of architectural styles, the building is a hybrid of Disneyland, Neuschwanstein (''Mad'' King Ludwig's castle in Bavaria) and the Addams' Family home. Quaint features include an abundance of fanciful arches, fake latticework filling window openings and the gilt and polychrome-tile-pattern stenciling decorating the interior and the exterior. The building's columns, cornices and eaves are especially colorful.</p><p>Church acquired hundreds of exotic objects on his travels in the Middle East, Mexico and South America, which he later used to decorate his home. Much of it is kitsch- -- instant antiques, ''tourist'' souvenirs, bazaar art -- but here and there you stumble across an appealing object or two. I particularly liked the collection of painted wooden chairs in the Court Hall, some of which might be Indian.</p><p>The views from the house are also superb. The best vantage point is the lofty bell tower (the bell was rung at meal times), from where you look down over orchards and barns, beyond which the river narrows and the landscape flattens to become a blanket of trees.</p><p>Silent and majestic, the Catskills rise in the distance. To contemplate this view is to be engulfed in what the art critic Christopher Knight calls ''an aesthetic reverie.''</p><p>Church painted many pictures of and from Olana.</p><p>Although there is nothing on display right now that depicts the house (mind you, there is a beautiful oil sketch of clouds over Olana in the collection), you can enjoy two winter scenes showing the view down the river from Olana toward Westchester, as well as a large, imposing painting titled ''Catskill Mountains From the Home of the Artist'' (1871). Church also devoted as much energy into creating a landscape at Olana as he did to painting it.</p><p>He planted thousands of trees around the property to frame or to compose views, designed miles of carriage trail routes and dredged a cranberry bog to create a 10-acre reflecting lake.</p><p>Why? He wanted to make an awe-inspiring, walk-in painting. Finished in 1900, the year of his death, it was his final work of art.</p><p>Olana State Historic Site, 5720 Route 9G in Hudson.
