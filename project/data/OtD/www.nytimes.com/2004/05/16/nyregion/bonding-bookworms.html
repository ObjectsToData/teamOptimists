There are sports games and practices, Brownie and Cub Scout meetings, and religious school, too.</p><p>Still, Tony Fedor has signed up Ashley, 8, and Matthew, 9, for Book Voyagers at the Monroe Public Library, a program that brings children and their parents, grandparents or caregivers together to read and discuss award-winning children's literature.</p><p>Being a part of a parent-child book group balances things out with the sports and the school activities, Mr. Fedor said.</p><p>The parent-child book groups are a natural progression from the adult book groups that are already popular. Here, parents read the same books as their children and get together with other families to talk about them. The children get one-on-one time with mom or dad and can cozy up alongside others.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Life shouldn't be this hectic, but it really is,'' said Susan Muro, the program director for Book Voyagers, which is run by the Connecticut Humanities Council in libraries around the state. ''Setting aside time for reading shows that reading has a priority and a place in our lives.''</p><p>Helene Tweed, 45, who joined a Voyagers program at the New Canaan Library with her daughter Melissa, 10, said, ''This is an oasis from the competition.''</p><p>About 65 percent of Connecticut towns have played host to Book Voyagers at a library since the program started in 1999; the program is open to children ages 6 through 14. The group meets one hour a week for four weeks.</p><p>There are 12 themes, like fantasy and Harry Potter, and each series is led by a gifted storyteller or children's literature specialist. Parents and children get to hear each other's views.</p><p>''What this program is about is getting people to come together over books, but the book is just a vehicle,'' said Jennifer Perry, a senior editor of children's books at Scholastic Inc. in Danbury and a longtime Voyagers discussion leader.</p><p>''In the hectic world we live in, parents don't have time to sit down with their children and ask questions other than 'How was school?' and 'When's the next practice?'</p><p>''This program really brings them together to talk about the much larger issues going on in their lives. These programs really help children develop an appreciation for reading, and they can use any story as a launching pad.''</p><p>The Fedors talked about the novel ''Junebug,'' Alice Mead's story about what it was like for a 9-year-old boy to live in a crummy housing project. Junebug's dream was to sail off to a better world, and he tucked a wish inside some bottles and cast them in the water. Now, Ashley and Matthew were going to make a wish, paint a glass bottle and put their wish inside.</p><p>There are also public groups like Book Voyagers in libraries and schools, and private groups in homes. Whether the group is public or private, families read the same books together. They talk about books they might not ordinarily read and by authors they might not know.</p><p>Though often a bit shy at first, the children are eager to speak up after a session or two. Parents say they notice that their children's confidence at speaking up in front of adults grow in this relaxed setting. The children get better at critiquing books, too.</p><p>Teresa Fernandes and Jan Merrill started a co-ed book group in Greenwich. There are three boys and three girls and the children are all in second grade. Annie Merrill, 7, is in the group.</p><p>''It's really nice to have something to do with my younger daughter that's just for us two,'' Ms. Merrill said. ''We both look forward to it.''</p><p>Ms. Fernandes said that her 7-year-old son, Sam Blitt, walks out of school with his face buried in a book, and reads until 11 at night. She can't attribute Sam's love of reading all to the book group. ''It happened simultaneously,'' she said.</p><p>Grace House, 11, always loved to read, too. So, her mother decided to start a mother-daughter book group for her in Wilton four years ago, when Grace was in second grade. The group has been meeting every six weeks, and Ms. House has started another group for Grace's younger sister, Gabrielle, 10. Each girl in their group gets a chance to choose a book and be the hostess.</p><p>The girls have become best friends, and the mothers have, too.</p><p>''What I've really enjoyed is seeing the growth in the girls,'' said Kelleen Weldon, who played host to the group at her home in Wilton in April with her daughter Chelsea, 11. ''When we started out in the book club, the moms were driving the conversation, coming up with the questions and pulling all the information out of the girls. The girls would be very reluctant to have opinions.''</p><p>That all changed after the first four meetings. The girls no longer feel uncomfortable disagreeing with each other.</p><p>''Chelsea was not into reading when we started the book club and she read only for academic reasons,'' Ms. Weldon said. ''Now she's very happy to sit down for the pleasure of reading and I owe it 100 percent to book club.''</p><p>Lynn Sadlon, the coordinator at the Fox Run Family Resource Center at Fox Run Elementary School, started a book group for mothers and fifth grade girls at the Norwalk school after reading Shireen Dodson's book, ''The Mother-Daughter Book Club: How Ten Busy Mothers and Daughters Came Together to Talk, Laugh and Learn Through Their Love of Reading.''</p><p>There are only three fifth graders and their mothers in the Norwalk group. They read coming-of-age novels, because Ms. Sadlon said she wanted to increase the communication between mothers and daughters as they approach adolescence.</p><p>The girls are given a job to do each month, and it might be discussion director or connector. The discussion director comes up with the questions about the book; the connector's job is to relate the book to something that is happening in the girl's life or in another book.</p><p>Connecting with ''The Private Notebook of Katie Roberts, Age 11'' by Amy Hest was easy for 11-year-old Christina Chironna of Norwalk last September. The story is about a girl whose mother remarried and was expecting twins.</p><p>What was the connection?</p><p>''I'm 11 and I'm going to have twin babies in my house,'' Christina said.</p><p>''It was just so fitting,'' said her mother, M.J. Chironna.</p><p>What was the best part of book group? That was easy.</p><p>''Being with her,'' Christina said as she sat smiling next to her mother.</p><p>Photo: Clockwise from left: Chelsea Weldon, 11, Kathy Glazebrook, a parent, Grace House, 11, Kelley Glazebrook, 11, and Katharine Mandia, 12.
