                    <p>Charon paused and looked out to see whether the audience was listening to her story with the same intensity with which she listened to her patient's. She is a striking, delicately boned woman, with large blue eyes set in a narrow face, and her reading has both the ingenuous charm of a schoolgirl, looking for attention and approval, and the canny confidence of a masterful storyteller who knows she has it. She's right; the audience was rapt.</p><p>The crowd of physicians, psychologists, nurses and English professors had come to participate in a conference on what is called ''narrative medicine,'' but in large part they had come simply to hear Rita Charon -- the leader of the burgeoning movement that seeks to situate storytelling at the center of medicine. Charon, a 54-year-old internist with a Ph.D. in literature, is the director of the pioneering Program in Narrative Medicine at Columbia University, which teaches literature, literary theory and creative writing to medical students and whose practices are rapidly being incorporated and adapted by schools across the country.</p><p>Narrative medicine imports terms from literature to describe the doctor-patient relationship. In describing his backache, Charon said, the Dominican man was actually telling an ''illness narrative,'' which can be interpreted just like a literary text: by examining the presentation of character, the structure of the tale and the plot of the disease. Regardless of the outcome -- the diagnosis or treatment (which Charon did not relate) -- what is central is the telling and receiving of the tale. Narrative medicine appears to answer a central paradox. Unlike other fields -- like literature -- medicine really is always getting better. Yet despite its ever-increasing efficacy, nearly half of patients seek out alternative care, and both patients and physicians voice increasing dissatisfaction with the practice of mainstream medicine.</p><p>Once upon a time, until the last century or so, doctors (and their predecessors, priests and shamans) had little in their tool bags except their humanity with which to channel that mysterious thing we call a healing encounter: that charged interaction -- personal and impersonal, physical and spiritual -- upon which so much depends. Now that blood tests have replaced bloodletting, how can the interaction be more rewarding?</p><p>The answer narrative medicine provides is that in growing as a science, medicine has forgotten that it is an art, which like other arts must celebrate the creation of stories. Increasingly, the medical profession is looking to a literary cure. The past five years have seen an explosion of writing about illness by both physicians and patients who -- like the Romantic poets during the Industrial Revolution -- are trying to restore a sense of meaning and healing to counter the dehumanizing effects of technological explosion. New literary journals have sprung up at medical schools, and longstanding ones have seen a significant increase in submissions and circulation. Prominent medical journals like JAMA have begun publishing personal reflections and poetry by physicians. (Recent titles include ''Rubor, Calor, Tumor, Dolor,'' and ''The Alzheimer Sonnets.'') Numerous medical schools have begun integrating courses in reading and writing into their curriculums.</p><p>Charon first coined the term ''narrative medicine'' in a January 2001 article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ''Narrative'' is the buzzword today in many academic disciplines, from philosophy to anthropology and psychology. Charon defines narrative medicine as ''medicine practiced with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, interpret and be moved by the stories of illness.''</p><p>The goals of narrative medicine are similar to those of other medical movements that have focused on communication and treating ''the whole person'' instead of the disease alone, like biopsychosocial medicine, patient-centered care, relationship-centered care, the primary care movement and others. But while other movements have used psychological and spiritual terms, narrative medicine uses literary ones.</p>                </div>
