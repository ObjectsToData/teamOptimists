    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In 1937, when Tom Williams was 26, he wrote a play called ''Spring Storm,'' and the following year read it aloud in his playwriting seminar at the University of Iowa. It was greeted by ''a long and all but unendurable silence,'' he later recalled, and ''was quite finally rejected by the class.'' After failing to get the play produced, he filed it in the forgotten drawer. He soon changed his name to Tennessee Williams, and within a few years began his career as a playwright.    ''Spring Storm'' was never produced or published during Williams's lifetime. Next month the play will finally have its New York premiere. The production, sanctioned by the Tennessee Williams estate, was brought about by an enterprising young director, Coy Middlebrook. The play, in rehearsal, will begin previews on May 5, opening May 9 at Theater at St. Clements in Manhattan. For Mr. Middlebrook it is a dream project he has nurtured for five years. He turned 36 on March 26, a birthday he shares with Williams, which he accepts as a sign of synergy.  ">

It was greeted by ''a long and all but unendurable silence,'' he later recalled, and ''was quite finally rejected by the class.'' After failing to get the play produced, he filed it in the forgotten drawer. He soon changed his name to Tennessee Williams, and within a few years began his career as a playwright.    ''Spring Storm'' was never produced or published during Williams's lifetime. Next month the play will finally have its New York premiere. The production, sanctioned by the Tennessee Williams estate, was brought about by an enterprising young director, Coy Middlebrook. The play, in rehearsal, will begin previews on May 5, opening May 9 at Theater at St. Clements in Manhattan. For Mr. Middlebrook it is a dream project he has nurtured for five years. He turned 36 on March 26, a birthday he shares with Williams, which he accepts as a sign of synergy.  "></div>

Next month the play will finally have its New York premiere. The production, sanctioned by the Tennessee Williams estate, was brought about by an enterprising young director, Coy Middlebrook. The play, in rehearsal, will begin previews on May 5, opening May 9 at Theater at St. Clements in Manhattan. For Mr. Middlebrook it is a dream project he has nurtured for five years. He turned 36 on March 26, a birthday he shares with Williams, which he accepts as a sign of synergy.</p><p>The play is set in a small Mississippi town and focuses on four mismatched lovers. At the center is Heavenly Critchfield, a young woman whom Williams described as ''frankly sensuous without being coarse, fiery-tempered and yet disarmingly sweet'' -- an early version of Blanche DuBois, Alma Winemiller and other subsequent Williams heroines.</p><p>''Spring Storm'' has a youthful exuberance and is filled with colorful characters and lyrical language. In it are themes that would dominate Williams's work for the next decades: the conflict between family responsibility and individual freedom, and how an unmarried woman can turn into ''a front-porch girl,'' someone who sits and waits for the next step in life.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In its earliest form, it was called ''April Is the Cruelest Month.'' Looking back, Williams once wrote, ''The idea of the play as I see it is simply a study of Sex -- a blind animal urge or force (like the regenerative force of April) gripping four lives and leading them into a tangle of cruel and ugly relations.''</p><p>Albert J. Devlin, professor of English at the University of Missouri at Columbia and co-editor of ''The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams,'' said, ''There is a passionate, violent quality in 'Spring Storm.' '' As such, he said, the play ''is a real precursor of 'Orpheus Descending.' ''</p><p>Robert Bray, editor of the Tennessee Williams Annual Review, said, ''It's interesting for its sorority of spinsters, women who find themselves victims of rejection or repression.'' In the play, he added, ''there are rough stones that would be more polished in later work.''</p><p>For years ''Spring Storm'' was in the Williams archive at the Harry Ransom Humanities Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In 1996 it was unearthed and given a staged reading at the Ensemble Studio Theater in Manhattan. On the basis of that reading, New Directions published it in 1999. Later it was reprinted in the Library of America two-volume collection of Williams plays. In recent years it has had productions at two small regional theaters in Mill Valley, Calif., and Austin, Tex.</p><p>When the play was staged in Austin by the Actors Repertory of Texas, Robert Faires said in his review in The Austin Chronicle that it had ''flashes of lyrical grace and true wisdom'' and was ''big, far-reaching, clumsy in places, but vivid and rich with promise.''</p><p>Coincidentally, there is now (through Saturday) a student production of ''Spring Storm'' at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Allean Hale, an adjunct professor at Urbana and an expert on Williams, said on the telephone that Williams's other early plays (like ''Stairs to the Roof'') were derivative, and that ''Spring Storm'' was ''the first play he wrote really from his own life.''</p><p>Although major theaters have expressed interest in the play, directors were evidently discouraged by the work's ambitiousness: more than 20 characters, settings that range from a high cliff overlooking the Mississippi River to a lavish garden party, and a storm onstage -- none of which has deterred Mr. Middlebrook.</p><p>He first became aware of the play when he was studying at the Actors Studio Drama School at the New School University in Manhattan and Krista Lambden, a classmate and an actress, gave him a copy. ''I was amazed by it -- all this rich, nourishing material,'' Mr. Middlebrook said in a recent interview. He decided to work on the play in the hope of producing it.</p><p>At the New School he was encouraged by Carlin Glynn, a Tony Award-winning actress and faculty member. In the spring of 2000, Mr. Middlebrook gathered 15 actors in her apartment for a reading. Ms. Glynn said she was impressed by the director's talent and by the Williams play. ''Early Williams,'' she said, ''is so much better than late almost anyone else.''</p><p>Mr. Middlebrook contacted Tom Erhardt, the agent who controls productions of Williams's plays, and Mr. Erhardt responded that a company in England had the English-speaking rights. Privately, Mr. Middlebrook continued working on scenes in the play with Ms. Lambden. In 2002 he was one of the founders of the Lobo Theater off Off Broadway and directed the company's first production, a revival of Lyle Kessler's ''Orphans.''</p><p>He put in another request to Mr. Erhardt, and this time was granted the rights for a four-week run. Speaking on the telephone from London, Mr. Erhardt said that several theaters in England had considered producing the play. The National Theater, which staged the world premiere of another early Williams work, ''Not About Nightingales,'' presented a public reading of ''Spring Storm.''</p><p>But with no other production scheduled, Mr. Erhardt decided to go with Mr. Middlebrook and the Lobo Theater. He wants to see the play performed, he said, and this ''may open a few doors for us.'' Mr. Erhardt has allowed Mr. Middlebrook ''some latitude'' in trimming the text.</p><p>Mr. Middlebrook said his goal was ''to streamline the play, to get the action of the events closer to each other,'' without destroying the poetry. He has cut some of the characters and will stage the play with a cast of 13.</p><p>Ms. Lambden will play Heavenly, and two experienced professionals, Ms. Glynn and Elizabeth Kemp, also have important roles. The budget for the play is $50,000. It would probably cost 20 times that on Broadway.</p><p>''I'm terrified,'' Mr. Middlebrook said, ''but I'm also exhilarated.'' So much of the play, he said, ''is a young Tennessee finding his voice.'' Were Williams alive today, he added, ''I hope that he would feel that if someone were going to dredge this out of the drawer that it should be us'' -- a young director and a youthful ensemble finding its voice.</p><p>Photo: Coy Middlebrook, left, at a production meeting for the revival of Tennessee Williams's ''Spring Storm.''
