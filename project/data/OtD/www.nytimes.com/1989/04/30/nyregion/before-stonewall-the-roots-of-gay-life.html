                    <p>''EVERYTHING came together at that one moment. This is it. This is what we've been waiting for. We've had enough. We're going to fight back.''</p><p>On June 27, 1969, these militant words summed up the response of the 200 or so patrons of the Stonewall Inn to what might have been just another in a series of police raids on gay bars in Greenwich Village.</p><p>What ensued was initially described as a melee and then, variously, as a riot and a wild insurrection. Beer cans, bricks, garbage and slabs of glass were hurled at police officers barricaded inside, while crowds ranging from as many as 400 to 1,000 mobilized outside for three days afterward.</p><p>The incident was historic, for it marked the beginning of an organized movement of homosexual activism. From then on, gay life would often be talked about in two categorical ways: before or after Stonewall.</p>                </div>

                    <p>To create a visual history of men and women who were stereotyped as outsiders, as living in ''the world of the twilight,'' as those who were ''that way'' and, by implication, to chronicle events that led to the Stonewall uprising, the documentary ''Before Stonewall'' was made.</p><p>Robert Rosenberg, who grew up in Elmont, co-produced (with John Scagliotti) and co-directed (with Greta Schiller) the 90-minute film, which is subtitled ''The Making of a Gay and Lesbian Community.''</p><p>It was released in 1986 and later shown on public educational television, after which it received an Emmy award.</p><p>As part of a series of documentaries on the theme, ''A Multicultural Society,'' which is being co-sponsored by the New York Council for the Humanities, ''Before Stonewall'' will be screened tomorrow at 7:30 P.M. at the State University of New York in Farmingdale and Tuesday at La Guardia Community College in Long Island City.</p><p>Following the screenings, Mr. Rosenberg, who is curator of the Global Village Documentary Festival, which runs through May 12 at Manhattan's Public Theater, and who recently completed a documentary about a Jewish family in Nicaragua (''Crossing Borders: A Jewish Witness for Peace''), will participate in a question-and-answer session with the audience.</p><p>In his office at the Media Studies Center of the New School for Social Research in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Rosenberg recalled the process of creating ''Before Stonewall,'' which was five years in the making.</p><p>''As an independent film maker trying to make my way, I realized that the issues of lesbian and gay life were sidestepped,'' he said. ''I was interested in revisionist and oral history, from new perspectives, from the standpoint of those involved.</p><p>''I thought it was possible to do visually interesting work and, at the same time, recover from the shadows our own ancestry, our forefathers and mothers.</p><p>''It had existed only in secretive form: home movies or in gay and lesbian archives around the country. It was also a fundable project, given the distance of time.''</p><p>''Before Stonewall,'' which was produced for $250,000, begins with footage of Ronald Reagan, as an actor in a military role, commanding a sergeant ''to report to wardrobe for assignment to 'Ladies of the Chorus.' ''</p><p>It then goes on to explore aspects of homosexual life during World War II and the McCarthy era and then to find ''deep connections'' among civil rights, women's liberation and gay pride.</p><p>Emphasizing that the film is not a collection of personal stories, not propaganda and not a polemic, Mr. Rosenberg said:</p><p>''The focus is on how a community evolved. A knowledge of history empowers us as a society. These were the people who led to liberation, who had the chutzpah to demand and protect their rights.</p><p>'' 'Stonewall' didn't come out of the sky. People have to decide how they would live their lives without oppression. This is not a ghettoized issue; it's not just for gays and lesbians, but designed to be accessible for the broadest possible audience. The real issue is choice.''</p><p>The 33-year-old Mr. Rosenberg, whose own gay life began in what he called a ''positive post-Stonewall'' era, was a student at Elmont Memorial High School during the early days of gay liberation.</p><p>''The Elmont Public Library had gay-positive books, like Dennis Altman's 'Homosexual Oppression and Liberation,' '' he said, ''but I took that one out with terror, hiding it from my parents.''</p><p>Mr. Rosenberg came to grips with his homosexual identity, ''with being comfortable with who I was,'' during his freshman year at Hampshire College in Massachusetts.</p><p>''Then I told my parents during Christmas break,'' he said. ''They were not too happy.''</p><p>However, his mother's reaction changed to supportiveness, while his father, a clinical psychologist, remained resistant.</p><p>''He was a political liberal,'' Mr. Rosenberg said, ''but he never acclimated to the idea on an emotional level. He was dying when I started applying for grants for 'Before Stonewall' in 1980, and among his last words to me were, 'Must you make this film?'</p><p>''When it opened, my mother said, 'Your father would have been proud,' but that was her illusion. I felt that he'd never be reconciled to it. Parents have to come out themselves as parents of gay children.''</p><p>Mr. Rosenberg's mother, Bernice, who still lives in Elmont, is ''now one of my best publicists,'' he said.</p><p>''She was an activist before I was born, and that must have been passed on subliminally. And now I've helped to reinspire her. My father died of asbestos-created cancer, and she's vice president of the White Lung Association and a member of the Older Women's League.''</p><p>Although Mr. Rosenberg, who lives in Brooklyn, says that battles have yet to be won - ''There is plenty of prejudice and homophobia in society, AIDS has decimated our community and it's not easy for any teen-ager coming out'' - he remains an ''overall optimist.''</p><p>Mr. Rosenberg is the father of a 2 1/2-year-old son, Noah, who lives with his lesbian mother, the child's custodial parent. The child was conceived by artificial insemination.</p><p>''Things are going in a positive direction,'' he said. ''Gay people have taken more initiative in defining for themselves the possibilities of family life, having roots, raising kids.</p><p>''There's a lifetime commitment. And isn't that a belief in the future, a declaration of hope?''</p><p>Photo of film producer Robert Rosenberg (NYT/Sara Krulwich)</p>                </div>
