                    <p>''The problem of arts funding today is rather Pirandellian - two endowments in search of a rationale,'' Leonard Garment said with a smile. But he was serious. The arts and humanities, he was saying, can no longer take Government support for granted nor relax in the belief that there is ''assumed virtue for programs like the arts.'' The economic and political climate has changed and ''the people in power are saying that every marginal dollar has to be justified.''</p><p>Mr. Garment has sound credentials for making such observations. From 1969 to 1974 he was a special consultant to President Richard M. Nixon, and he is credited with having persuaded the President to lead Congress to increase the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts from $8 million in 1969 to nearly $75 million five years later. Arts and the Deficit</p><p>Next Wednesday, which is Arts and Culture Advocacy Day, Mr. Garment is to deliver the second annual Nancy Hanks lecture before some 400 arts lobbyists at the National Academy of Sciences. Earlier in the day, arts administratiors from across the nation will meet with members of Congress to ask for financial support and to try to raise their awareness of the importance of cultural activities. Mr. Garment's topic will be Government support of the arts when all Federal spending is ''measured by the great standard of the budget deficit.'' The lecture is sponsored by the American Council for the Arts, the Friends of Nancy Hanks and the Gannett Foundation. Nancy Hanks, the second chairman of the arts endowment, died in 1983.</p><p>Mr. Garment, a well-known Washington lawyer and Government adviser, is a master of cultural politics. Equally at home with people who frequent the corridors of power and with artists and intellectuals, he recently spent a day at the Federal Emergency Management Administration, where he and his partner, David I. Shapiro, are representing a consortium of Alaskan fishermen in their negligence suit against the Exxon Corporation over the oil spill in Prince William Sound. That evening, he played jazz clarinet with his musician friends at a local night spot. 'Beginning of the End'</p>                </div>

                    <p>Unlike many people in the arts today who think Government support for the arts has a secure foundation, Mr. Garment is dubious. The Reagan Administration's effort to cut the arts budget severely in 1981 and the recent slashing of the budget for the state arts council in Massachusetts are signals that ''we are at the beginning of the end of the halcyon days of support for the arts, in the sense of the unexamined argument,'' he said.</p><p>''I think there is a time of testing ahead when people, counting a whole range of budget questions, will begin to examine the marginal areas of Federal, state and local budgets,'' he said. ''And with just a little bad luck there can be mayhem in the comptroller's office.''</p><p>Intense competition for Government support comes about, he said, because ''we live in a hydraulic world, increasingly moved by distant moving parts.'' He cited such pressures on the budget as ''the large and growing deficit,'' the instability of the dollar, changing patterns of trade, such bedrock Government expenses as national defense and programs ''to protect the national economy,'' which cannot be significantly altered, and new budget items generated by what he calls today's therapeutic culture.</p><p>''It's more than diet and jogging,'' he explained. ''It's the need for money for drug-dependency studies, alcoholism studies and a great many other things.'' Opportunities Today</p><p>''It's not enough,'' he continued, ''to have the American Arts Alliance and other good, friendly organizations go down to Washington and talk to the major patron.'' Speaking of Senator Claiborne Pell and Representative Sidney R. Yates, he said, ''Pell and Yates are wonderful guys, and they have all kinds of seniority, but they are pre-sold and to some extent their powers and strengths are pre-shrunk.''</p><p>''When the endowment's budget was increased quite dramatically under President Nixon, with Nancy Hanks as chairman of the endowment,'' he said, ''that was a certain time and place. She was right just then, and President Nixon was interested for reasons that were again peculiar to that time and place. Now, nearly a quarter of a century later, times have changed, and one has to find out what is right for this time and place. Are there comparable opportunities today?''</p><p>Asked to answer his own question, Mr. Garment replied: ''I think the education of children is central to the solution to problems of health, crime, delinquency and general social pathology, and if arts organizations get involved in education they can become part of a broad new coalition. I don't mean the endowments should give up everything else they're doing, but I think education offers a possibility for an announced, focused moving into areas that everybody is concerned about, not just people who have a very strong feeling for chamber music. Art Leading to Work</p><p>''For most children, producing art is their introduction to work. They discover what powerful satisfaction work can give. These are the impulses people need if they are to be productive members of society. Furthermore, if children are to become innovative, they must be at home in the world, and nothing better suits them for that than a broad education which includes the arts.''</p><p>The idea of the social role of the arts is one that springs from Mr. Garment's personal experience. ''To me,'' he said, ''growing up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in a lower-level economic family, the arts were the integrating instrument in my life. It was music and jazz. My mother used to save money for the Jewish National Fund for growing trees in Palestine - that was before Israel - and she put coins in a little can called a pushke, but she had another little can where she would put coins to buy me a Buffet, the world's finest and most expensive clarinet.''</p><p>''Well,'' he said, ''I met jazz musicians and entered the Brooklyn College jazz club. My whole world opened up. I left school to play in a band, and when I came back I had a sense of one of the languages of the world that I would never have had otherwise.''</p><p>''What I'm saying is that to justify the expenditure of Government funds for art, you have to show what it can do,'' he said. ''The new flag of the National Endowment for the Arts should say on it what Lincoln said in his second inaugural: 'Think anew; act anew.' Those are timeless words.''</p><p>Photo of Leonard Garment (NYT/Phil Hosefros)</p>                </div>
