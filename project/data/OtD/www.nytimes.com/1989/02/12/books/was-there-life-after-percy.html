                    <p>MARY SHELLEY  Romance and Reality.  By Emily W. Sunstein.  Illustrated. 478 pp. Boston:  Little, Brown &amp; Company. $24.95.</p><p>If we were to see Mary Shelley's life enacted upon a stage, we would certainly dismiss it as an improbable fiction. Her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, whose book ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is one of the earliest widely known feminist texts, died a few days after giving birth to her. Her father, William Godwin, a powerful philosopher of his time, brought her up to honor the memory of her mother and to adore him. Although Percy Bysshe Shelley was already married, his admiration for Godwin led him to love Godwin and Wollstonecraft's daughter. Mary, determined to live out the principles of her dead mother and adored father, ran off with Shelley, finding in him the perfect male companion.</p><p>Idealist, genius, guilt-ridden and confused, he was almost as much a victim of their times as she. In the company of people whose lives cross hers like characters in a television version of Romanticism, Mary Shelley lived out her unconventional, unplotted destiny. Eight years after running away with Shelley, she had buried her husband and three of her four children, written (at 19) one of the world's masterpieces, ''Frankenstein,'' learned to speak five languages and begun the study of Greek; she was not yet 25.</p><p>Emily W. Sunstein, an independent scholar and author of ''A Different Face: The Life of Mary Wollstonecraft,'' goes on carefully to evoke the less explored part of Mary Shelley's career. The remaining years of her life (she died of a brain tumor at 54 in 1851) were spent in trying, as a few daring women have done since, to balance her ideals and energy against the strictures of the Victorian morality that followed hard upon the age of Romanticism. Far happier on the Continent, she was forced ever after to remain in England to insure her only child, Percy, his inheritance. She loathed England's ''social system, moralism, and dullness''; conventional circles shunned her. As Ms. Sunstein sums up these English years, Mary Shelley ''made herself into a professional writer, helped to support her father as well as her son, and tried to continue the essence of her former life in retirement with a woman friend.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Hers is a life emblematic in its generosity and fear as she threaded her way through difficult and penurious experiences for which there was no script. Mary Wollstonecraft had said of her older daughter, Fanny: ''I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit.'' Godwin unfolded the mind of Mary Shelley; while he could not render her fit for the world she would inhabit, she was, we now learn from this biography, as fit as anyone could be. Mary Shelley believed that ''she was Wollstonecraft's last regret solaced, her last wish fulfilled: a daughter who chose young to pursue joy and greatness with a worthy companion regardless of a benighted, hypocritical world.'' Life, of course, was to demand more of her than joy and greatness.</p><p>''Mary Shelley'' is almost as full of event as the daily life its subjects led. So it should be. The author has not played literary critic of the works - the bibliography lists seven pages of them, including ''The Last Man,'' Mary Shelley's most famous work after ''Frankenstein,'' and some virtually unknown or newly attributed to her by Ms. Sunstein. The biographer amply demonstrates that other commentators have strained to put the worst possible construction on every act and word of Mary Shelley's. Beginning with Edward Trelawny, who outright lied about many matters, they blamed her for not having her husband's best wishes at heart, and some went even so far as to assert that she did not write ''Frankenstein.'' Ms. Sunstein has corrected the erroneous assumptions that have misled so many critics, myself (when young) included.</p><p>As a budding literary critic in 1960, I was guilty of exactly the sort of misapprehension now disproved. Writing the life of the Garnett family, I condemned the young biographer Richard Garnett for defending Mary Shelley, not only helping thus to perpetuate a calumny but missing the chance to celebrate Garnett's insights. Yet even Garnett, who, Ms. Sunstein tells us, answered Trelawny's charges and exposed his inaccuracies about the Shelleys and Byron, was to write of Mary Shelley that ''nothing but an absolute magnetising of her brain by Shelley's can account for her having risen so far above her usual self as in 'Frankenstein.' '' When she was not being condemned as immoral and dishonorable for running away with Shelley, and for his first wife's suicide, Mary Shelley was reduced to subsidiary importance, a wraith in Shelley's shadow. Critics nowadays accuse her unfairly of excessive admiration for the bourgeois family, even as Trelawny and other ''friends'' of Percy Bysshe Shelley found her insufficiently self-sacrificing toward him.</p><p>The casual reader of biography may find too many details here; they are, however, essential to the story Ms. Sunstein has to tell. Mary Shelley's girlhood prepared her, as Margaret Fuller's father had prepared his daughter, for a destiny nowhere possible in the world she would inhabit. Yet Shelley, and the Romantic age he and his friends illuminated so brilliantly and for so short a time, gave her the chance to release her powers, to create and, in endless pain and compromise, to endure. Biographies of brilliant women can only tell us how they made the best, and often a dazzling best, of what the world gave them. This one promises to be the definitive biography of Mary Shelley. My only complaint is minor indeed. Ms. Sunstein, perhaps to provide transitions between the extraordinary events of her subject's life, falls into the ''had I but known'' mode of narration. ''Change was coming, indeed revolutionary change, but not in any form that she had anticipated,'' ends one chapter. ''The time was approaching . . . when she would trust that she had found . . . the third serious love of her career,'' ends another. Yet a book must be judged on a scale commensurate with its ambitions. Ms. Sunstein is to be praised for looking anew at so misunderstood a life.</p><p>''We think back through our mothers if we are women,'' Virginia Woolf said. As biographers of women, we must, as Ms. Sunstein has done, ignore old reputations and, by means of our revisionary work, become the belated daughters of mothers long dead and long betrayed by history.</p><p>Drawing of Mary Shelly (Mark D.
