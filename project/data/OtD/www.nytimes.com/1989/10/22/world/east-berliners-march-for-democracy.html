                    <p>Several thousand East Berliners marched hand-in-hand in a single line through the center of the city today in the first demonstration for more democracy in the East German capital since Egon Krenz replaced Erich Honecker as Communist Party leader last Wednesday. The police did not interfere.</p><p>The marchers defied a warning by the Berlin party chief, Gunter Schabowski, who engaged demonstrators in discussion in front of the main government building, the Palace of the Republic. He urged them not to endanger what he called ''a new age'' by an ''escalation'' of pressure.</p><p>Few people here, however, seem to think that the change in leadership marks ''a new age.''</p><p>Conversations with East Berliners since Mr. Krenz replaced Mr. Honecker indicate that it will take more than replacing one hard-line leader with another to calm the unrest that has erupted in the last month.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Despite Mr. Krenz's efforts to show that he will try to maintain close touch with the people of this country, open its press to critical voices and try to open discussions with the Protestant churches, under whose roofs many dissenters are sheltered, the new leader appears not to have achieved credibility as a man of renewal. A Factory Hand Comments</p><p>A retired factory hand, speaking in the pungent accent and mocking vocabulary of the Berlin working class, nearly exploded with derisive laughter when asked whether he expected a change toward a more open society.</p><p>''From him?'' he asked with a snort. ''After he went to China to congratulate them for the blood they spilled? After he rigged our last election? After being the boss of State Security? The sparrows on the roof wouldn't believe him.''</p><p>Mr. Krenz has praised the Chinese leadership for crushing of the democracy movement in June. After local elections in May, dissidents charged that cheating was widespread; as party secretary in charge of internal affairs, including the feared Security Service, Mr. Krenz is assumed to have been responsible.</p><p>Although Mr. Honecker is seen by some as an orthodox Communist who led the most productive Communist country into economic stagnation, others, particularly the middle-aged, still see him as the successor to the hated Walter Ulbricht. 'Careerists or Ham Actors'</p><p>To many of that generation, the 77-year-old Mr. Honecker, who succeeded Mr. Ulbricht in 1971, appears as a scapegoat sacrificed by ambitious men like Mr. Krenz, 52 years old, who until Mr. Honecker's last day in office gave him full support and praise.</p><p>Mr. Honecker's reputation has also been enhanced in some circles by reports attributed to Gunter Schabowski, Politburo member and head of the East Berlin party, that the former leader fought tooth and nail for his job at Tuesday's Politburo meeting that deposed him but was still ousted without dissent by the 163-member Central Committee, whose members all owed Mr. Honecker their jobs. Only his own abstention marred unanimity.</p><p>''At least Honecker had some legitimacy for having been a Communist when it was dangerous and suffering in Nazi jails,'' a scholar and party member said. ''The new one has always been just a careerist and a provincial ham actor.''</p><p>''They're all the same,'' said a driver for a Government organization. ''The reasonable ones never made it into the Politburo. Erich was just the honorary top man these last years. It was Hager who used him, and he is still there.'' Staying in Power</p><p>Kurt Hager, the Politburo's 77-year-old ideologist and perhaps the least popular member of a widely unpopular leadership, remains in power, despite his vocal opposition to applying the liberalization program of Mikhail S. Gorbachev to this country.</p><p>Academics report that staff members, from professors to janitors, at the many educational and research institutions in the capital were in a state of political ferment that began last month, when the exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans to West Germany by way of other Communist countries started, and has reached new heights since the leadership change.</p><p>They said that although few trusted the sincerity of Mr. Krenz's pledges to create an atmosphere of greater openness, intellectuals and young people were in the mood to test the new possibilities to the full. Research institutions in law, the social sciences and the humanities were reported to be humming with meetings of Communist Party and trade-union units, which are drafting resolutions for top leaders.</p><p>While careful to stress support for Communism and the independence of this country - the shibboleths of East Germany - the debates and resolutions demand above all freedom of expression and association. Many Bulletin Boards</p><p>They follow resolutions by theater workers, popular and classical musicians and others in the arts that together with protest marches starting from churches broke the ice of rigid orthodoxy and ousted Mr. Honecker. Actors have read such texts from the stage, and resolutions are attached to theater walls for audiences to sign.</p><p>In apartment buildings, notices calling for protest meetings have been appearing on the bulletin boards that had have always been reserved for calls for support for party and government.</p><p>Participants at academic discussions reported virtually unanimous skepticism about Mr. Krenz's committment to genuine change. Intellectuals and young people said they had been repelled by the hour-long television speech, a repetition of his address to the earlier Central Committee session, with which Mr. Krenz began his rule Wednesday night.</p><p>Not only did the speech and Mr. Krenz's subsequent pronouncements offer no specific changes, according to many people who heard them, they were also couched in the jargon that party functionaries learn in the many party schools through which they pass on their way to the top. Because of its remoteness from common German and frequent incomprehensibility, it is called here ''party Chinese.''</p><p>In a group of academics, there was consensus that optimism for Mr. Krenz's rule could stem only from what they believe to be his opportunism which, they say, made him aspire to leadership even in his first party organization, in elementary school. They said his style showed an attempt to imitate Mr. Gorbachev and expressed hope that this would also lead Mr. Krenz to espouse some of the Soviet leader's ideas.</p><p>Egon Krenz, who replaced Erich Honecker as the East German Communist Party leader last Wednesday.
