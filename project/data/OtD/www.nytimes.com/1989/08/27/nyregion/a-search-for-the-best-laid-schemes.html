                    <p>AS Elizabeth Mills Brown searches through the cities and towns of Connecticut, she knows just what she wants. ''I want everything of distinction,'' she says. Mrs. Brown's task is to find the state's best architecture.</p><p>She is researching and writing ''Connecticut: A Guide to Its Architecture and Towns,'' to be published by Oxford University Press in the early 1990's as one of 70 volumes on the architecture of the United States. Mrs. Brown's volume on Connecticut will have at least 600 pages and hundreds of photos. It will cover about 2,000 individual buildings and 500 town or city scenes, including modest churches, stately mansions, colonial homes, 19th-century mills and contemporary academic buildings.</p><p>''It's an enormous job,'' said Mrs. Brown, a Guilford resident who holds a master's degree in art history from Yale University. She is the author of ''New Haven: A Guide to Architecture and Urban Design.''</p><p>''The thing that makes it hard to do - and that makes it fascinating - is that this small state is packed with the whole history of New England,'' she said. ''It spans the whole architectural experience of the country. We have high style; we have the vernacular; we have the industrial; we have a little bit of everything.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mrs. Brown describes Connecticut as ''a very unusual little state that packs in a whole lot of geological areas: mountains, plains, river valleys, coastline.'' She said these areas produced different cultures with their own architecture, like the port towns along the Connecticut River.</p><p>She observed that Connecticut architecture reflects ''moments in time'' - periods when industries were built up or declined, railroads came and then were superseded by highways, and when towns were bypassed or developed.</p><p>''All this is part of understanding 'why is this building here? How did it get here? Why is it still here?' '' Mrs. Brown said, explaining that she wants her readers to see buildings in context.</p><p>Mrs. Brown is proceeding region by region. ''Regions hang together,'' she said.  Scouting Buildings</p><p>''I have three consultants doing field work,'' she said. ''They scout out areas I should look at; then I go and look them over.''</p><p>Mrs. Brown always instructs her consultants to ''scout around outside of Main Street,'' because she does not want to miss the less visible, the less well known. Another consultant pores over architectural journals.</p><p>Once places are found, they are carefully researched. ''We have to learn everything we can about the buildings,'' Mrs. Brown said. She writes as she goes along, and then revises. She added that Connecticut photographers will take pictures for the book.</p><p>Mrs. Brown said her own field work has aroused suspicions. ''I've had people call the police,'' she said. This has happened after being spotted driving around and around the same area, getting a good view or just looking for a parking place.</p><p>Mrs. Brown's work has even given her some design ideas unrelated to architecture. She explained that she spends so much time in her car that she is looking into ways to redesign the American automobile.  High Praise</p><p>But when it comes to buildings, Mrs. Brown has high praise for the designs of individual structures and groups of them throughout Connecticut.</p><p>She admires Fairfield County's impressive public buildings and fine old estates, like the Lockwood-Matthews house in Norwalk. She likes towns all over the state. ''One of the great achievements of Connecticut architecture is towns,'' she said, adding that as many as 100 of the state's 169 towns ''work as towns.'' She said, ''We have some good examples of seaport towns, like Southport and Stonington, and New London has a lot left.''</p><p>Mrs. Brown also cited towns like Litchfield and Durham which were built along ridges. She especially likes Durham's Church of the Epiphany, a Gothic-style frame church built in the 1860's and later topped with a tower. ''It's a beauty,'' she said.  Old Mill Towns</p><p>Connecticut's old mill towns also deserve recognition, she said, explaining: ''Some of the greatest building of the 19th century was industrial. Some of the great mill buildings are still there, and the houses built by the companies.'' For example, she said, there are places like Baltic and Willimantic. She said that she saw an ''urgent need for preservation and for finding ways to rehabilitate and use'' old mill complexes.</p><p>She regards the once bustling mill city of Norwich, and many little towns around the state, as little-known architectural gems.</p><p>''One of the most wonderful towns in Connecticut - that a lot of people don't know about - is Norwich,'' she said. ''And there are places tucked away that are full of delight. That's what people don't know. How many people know New Hartford? Eastford? Gurleyville? North Guilford?''</p><p>She noted that while people justly admire the architecture of Connecticut's colonial period, they sometimes underrate the value of buildings from other times. For instance, she said, ''People say, 'Oh, that's only colonial revival.''' But she pointed out that the colonial revival period, from about 1900 to 1940, was a great building period, for by then Connecticut had an architectural profession of its own.  Good Word for the Suburbs</p><p>''And, it's time to stop being snobby about suburbs,'' Mrs. Brown said. She noted that suburbs have provided a high standard of living for many people, and that many suburban communities built before the 1920's are especially well designed and well landscaped.</p><p>''Age isn't all that matters,'' she said. ''It's not all 'ye olde,''' Mrs. Brown's book will include buildings constructed in very recent years. Of particular note, she said, are high-style contemporary buildings at private educational institutions. For example, the book will cover the work at Yale University of such leading modern architects as Eero Saarinen, Philip Johnson and Louis Kahn, and the Hartford Seminary building of Richard Meier.</p><p>Mrs. Brown said her book, like others in the series, will be a serious work as well as a convenient-to-use guidebook. ''Although this book is in the form of a guidebook with maps, it is based on research designed for use by scholars and students,'' she said. She added that the whole series will be very helpful for tourists as well as scholars. ''For the first time, you'll be able to see Ameican architecture in context,'' she said.</p><p>Mrs. Brown's book is financed by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Connecticut Architecture Foundation. Checking journals for the project is Emay Twining Buck. Field consultants are Jan Cunningham of Cunningham Associates, in Middletown, and Bruce Clouette and Matthew Roth of Historic Resource Consultants, in Hartford. Mrs. Brown's secretary, Sarah McCulloch, keeps the field workers sane by obtaining street maps of almost every town in Connecticut.</p><p>''And, I'm getting a great deal of help from local sources in every town,'' Mrs. Brown said, adding that despite all efforts, ''It would be impossible not to miss a lot of great things.''</p><p>Anyone with material that might be relevant to the work, like old photographs, building records, or information on little-known or unpublished buildings, can write to Mrs. Brown at Old Quarry, Guilford, Conn. 06347.</p><p>Photo of Elizabeth Mills Brown, working on a guidebook to Connecticut architecture; the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion in Norwalk (pg. 1); the Egyptian-style gate at the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven; a bow-front style house on Academy Street in New Haven (pg. 12); (NYT/Stephen Castagneto)</p>                </div>
