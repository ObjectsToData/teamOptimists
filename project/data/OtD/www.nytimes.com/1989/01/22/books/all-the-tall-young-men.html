                    <p>A SEASON INSIDE  One Year in College Basketball.  By John Feinstein.  464 pp. New York: Villard Books. $18.95.</p><p>In ''A Season on the Brink,'' John Feinstein followed Coach Bob Knight and the Indiana University basketball team through the 1985-86 season. His new book, ''A Season Inside,'' begins and ends in Kansas City with Coach Larry Brown and the forward Danny Manning of the University of Kansas. In between, in a six-month odyssey that takes him to 104 college basketball games, Mr. Feinstein, a sports reporter for The Washington Post, checks in on several dozen teams (including most of the 1987-88 top 20) as the winter wears down to the glamour activity of the season, the 64-team N.C.A.A. Division I tournament.</p><p>As he crisscrosses the country on his way to Kansas City's Kemper Arena and the Final Four, Mr. Feinstein converts the college season into docudrama, weaving vignettes featuring players and their parents, referees, sportscasters, college officials and hucksters into a datelined narrative. He keeps this busy history coherent by drawing extended, novelistic sketches of his principal characters, most often the coaches. By enveloping the players in their mentors' often flamboyant personalities, Mr. Feinstein is able to attach identities to teams that might otherwise run together in a faceless procession of tall young men. It is the coaches, much more than the players, who star in this book, and that is a revealing emphasis.</p><p>Even before Dan Quayle acknowledged his philosophical debt to Bob Knight, the Hoosier coach had achieved the public recognition usually reserved for rock stars. For Mr. Feinstein, it is high-profilers like Mr. Knight, the lovable Rollie Massimino of Villanova, ''show biz'' Jim Valvano of North Carolina State, smooth Dean Smith of the University of North Carolina, unrepentant Jerry Tarkanian of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and unsinkable Lefty Driesell, formerly of Maryland and the Len Bias affair, now of James Madison, who give the college game its continuity, its special character and, in some cases, its special odor. To hometown fans, of course, each year produces its local heroes, but national recognition goes to a handful of outstanding players bound for the National Basketball Association. Though he spotlights Danny Manning and Navy's David Robinson, and though he labors to achieve a racial balance with stories about exemplary white players such as Arizona's Steve Kerr (whose father, then president of the American University of Beirut, was gunned down in Lebanon in 1984), it is only intermittently and with a heavy hand that Mr. Feinstein gives life to these portrayals.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Although he describes their feats in fast, bouncy prose, that does not solve the problem that many of these young men are more interesting as athletes than as people; all but the most talented athletes belong to interchangeable categories, to body types and positions. While the competition for their recruitment - tellingly described by Mr. Feinstein - is as staggering in intensity as it is repulsive in its dishonesty, a large number of college athletes annually fall by the wayside, so that this detailed narrative is cluttered with the nearly anonymous bodies of the injured, the addicted and the academically unqualified and disqualified. Mr. Feinstein acknowledges these casualties of the system, but his purpose, he says, is to describe the inside culture of college basketball. It is not to suggest that ours is a nation that eats its young.</p><p>Yet Division I basketball is not a culture but rather a subculture living somewhere in the deep pockets of that extralarge player, all-American corporate capitalism. Thus, while the National Collegiate Athletic Association's rules are wonderfully elaborate, they did not prevent Danny Manning's father from getting a coaching job at Kansas at the same time that his son was being recruited by Larry Brown. And although the ''amateur'' college game forbids players from collecting endorsements, it allows coaches to serve as hosts on television shows, incorporate their clinics and moonlight for companies like Nike, which pays a handful of big-name coaches between $120,000 and $200,000 yearly to distribute free shoes to their players. While colleges represented by these teams may rake in welcome television and tournament dollars, they seldom devalue their academic stock in exchange, since only a third of all N.C.A.A. Division I basketball players (including all those sitting permanently on the bench) currently earn baccalaureate degrees. Mr. Feinstein praises some schools where players graduate in large numbers, but he is silent about the rest.</p><p>Were he less silent, it is unlikely that Mr. Feinstein would be welcome in the locker rooms and the team meetings where he collects his inside stories, and surely he knows how high are the odds against achieving more than cosmetic improvement in the academic programs. Basketball is now a big multinational business. Though only a tiny percentage of college stars will make it in the N.B.A., more may hope to play in Europe or South America. A genuine ''world series'' in basketball may not be far away; a telegenic sport, basketball is fast approaching soccer in international popularity.</p><p>Some may complain that the cost for this entertainment is falling disproportionately on the shoulders of young black men - reflecting the transformation, as the sports sociologist Harry Edwards puts it, of Jim Crow to James Crow, Esquire. Indeed, had photographs been included in this book, as they were in ''A Season on the Brink,'' that point would have been explicit. But the growth of the sport is so irresistible that the real achievement of recent N.C.A.A. ''reforms'' has been the creation of additional layers of complicity in the academic farm system. Junior colleges increasingly shelter and grant questionable degrees to players who otherwise cannot qualify for four-year programs; the Division I institutions then accept these students, sometimes by prior arrangement, with the task of keeping them academically qualified to compete, at times for only a single year.</p><p>Of course, none of this is Mr. Feinstein's fault, and while he does not go out of his way to report on this part of the game, neither does he deny it. ''A Season Inside'' is a buoyant and entertaining tribute to college basketball, but it inadvertently raises troubling questions. By the end of his upbeat chronicle, even people who love the game as much as John Feinstein does may wonder how many of the players he describes could actually read his book.</p><p>Photo of Danny Manning of the University of Kansas being mobbed by teammates after leading Kansas to victory in the 1988 N.C.A.A. championship game.
