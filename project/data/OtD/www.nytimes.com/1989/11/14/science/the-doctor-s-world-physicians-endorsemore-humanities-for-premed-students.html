                    <p>MOUNTING evidence of the medical profession's estrangement from the public has led many leaders to blame much of the problem on the narrowness of a physician's training. Now many physicians have supported those views in a survey of graduates from three liberal arts colleges in Pennsylvania.</p><p>The survey is believed to be the first to reflect practicing physicians' views of their own undergraduate education. The doctors said they wished they had taken more courses in the humanities and said they took too many science courses that were not needed in their daily work.</p><p>Moreover, many physicians said their undergraduate education did not provide them with enough skills in dealing with people.</p><p>The physicians in the survey went to Franklin and Marshall, Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges. The colleges were chosen because of their strong liberal arts undergraduate programs, success in preparing future physicians and willingness to cooperate in the study, said the authors, Dr. David W. Fraser and Dr. Leah J. Smith of Swarthmore.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Fraser, who is a physician and president of Swarthmore, said in an interview that he was ''startled such a study had not been done before because it seems so obvious a thing to do.'' He said he hoped the findings would encourage prospective physicians to take full advantage of a liberal arts education before entering medical school with confidence that it will contribute to their professional and personal lives.</p><p>Dr. Fraser and Dr. Smith asked 960 physicians who studied at the three colleges from 1955 to 1982 to answer questions about the ways their undergraduate education had prepared them for careers in medicine.</p><p>Of the 589 respondents, 73 percent majored in science, 13 percent in a social science and 14 percent in the humanities. The percentage of humanities majors was about five times the average reported in a national survey a decade ago.</p><p>If they had been assured of admission to the medical schools in which they finally enrolled, 31 percent said they would have majored in the humanities, 17 percent in the social sciences and 54 percent in the sciences. The doctors said they took a heavy dose of science, particularly chemistry, at the expense of the humanities to improve their odds of admission to medical school.</p><p>''This discrepancy between training and need suggests that medical schools should go further than they have in limiting the required or recommended undergraduate science courses to a minimum,'' the authors said in the September issue of Academic Medicine. The journal is published by the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington.</p><p>Medical school officials have repeatedly told premedical students to choose their courses according to their interests and have urged those inclined to major in the humanities to do so. Yet many students have viewed such advice with skepticism because of a perception that medical schools favor science majors.</p><p>Dr. Myron S. Magen, dean of the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine in East Lansing, agrees that medical educators are hypocritical in saying they seek the broadly educated student who is schooled in the humanities.</p><p>''That is one of the greatest canards'' inflicted on premedical students, Dr. Magen said in an interview. ''They know we are lying and consequently they load up on the sciences, and that is what we look at.''</p><p>Dr. Magen said that medical schools, faced with a sharp drop in the number of applicants in recent years, are likely to admit larger numbers of more liberally educated students.</p><p>The basic science curriculum in medical school has come under attack because it typically emphasizes mastery of an immense body of knowledge, rather than independent thinking. As a partial step to broaden a physician's education, some students may study the humanities during medical school.</p><p>Dr. Stanley S. Bergen Jr., president of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said he and his staff are developing a program that would allow medical and dental students to take courses in the humanities and behavioral sciences at Rutgers and five state colleges, Jersey City, Kean, Montclair, Ramapo and William Patterson.</p><p>While the program would be elective in its initial stages, Dr. Bergen expressed hope that it would eventually be mandatory. Such a program would be a step toward ''assuring a more well-rounded doctor and addressing some of the complaints voiced so loudly and so accurately by the public today,'' Dr. Bergen said.</p><p>Educators have long debated the importance of the nonscience part of a physician's training to the practice of medicine. The concern in recent years has been a perceived loss of perspective on broader social and economic problems.</p><p>Dr. Lewis Thomas, the author of several best-selling books of essays on medicine and a former head of several medical schools and research institutions, has said that ''the influence of the modern medical school on liberal arts education in this country over the last decade has been baleful and malign, nothing less.''</p><p>Dr. Thomas placed the blame squarely on the admission policies of the nation's 127 medical schools. These institutions, he said, ''used to say they wanted applicants as broadly educated as possible, and they used to mean it.''</p><p>Criticism from medical leaders has led to a change in the examination that students take for admission to medical school. Beginning in 1991, the Association of American Medical Colleges will add two 30-minute essays to the admission test to help medical schools evaluate communications skills and to encourage more students to take writing courses.</p><p>Many physicians have said that if medical educators were sincerely concerned with reviving the humanities in medicine they would do well to change their student-selection process.</p><p>Medical educators say that more than half of all college humanities majors who apply to medical school get in. But critics point out that humanities majors constitute only 4 percent of all medical students.</p><p>Dr. Fraser said that as an undergraduate majoring in biology at Haverford, his goal was to become a college teacher. His experience, he said, ''told me I didn't want to be a lab scientist doing what my mentors were doing.''' Now, Dr. Fraser said, he wishes he had majored in philosophy.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
