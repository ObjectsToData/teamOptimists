                    <p>BEFORE the Reagan Administration cut off liberal money to the arts and humanities, I traveled around to a lot of posh little writing-teaching gigs. They'd fly you in, you'd get a pile of manuscripts to look over and a bunch of students. After some seminars and receptions, you'd take your check and fly home.</p><p>The money was good, the hours short, the limelight sweet. But when I look back and try to figure out, ''What exactly did I teach those people?'' the only thing that stands out occurred, I think, at a weekend fiction workshop somewhere in Texas. Thirty students had been picked by the regents - not on their ability, I gradually found out, but according to how much money their families had donated to the university.</p><p>One of these chosen 30 was a nervous, blue-haired old lady; she had given a lot of money to the history wing of the library, one of the regents confided before he introduced her. She was known throughout the country as a philanthropist, activist and amateur anthropologist. But I discerned at once that what she wanted to be known as, above all, was a writer. You can't mistake those burning eyes. . . .</p><p>When her turn came, she pitty-patted primly to the front of the class with a gay bouquet of pink-inked pages and began reading - a tale dealing with her youth in an orchard where she was trying to pick peaches and with her mature life in a nursing home where she was trying to teach people who could barely speak the English language something about English literature. And about her husband and his near-rise to the Senate, poor man.</p>                </div>

                    <p>I listened to her sing-songing this sort of stuff for 45 minutes. I was amazed, impressed, appalled, touched, embarrassed. Most of all, I was mad as hell. Nobody had screened this story at all! Or, worse, somebody had screened it, but felt that telling the woman it was unseemly gibberish might be fiscally imprudent. BY the time she'd been reading for about half an hour, she didn't have to be told. She knew. Everyone who has ever read in front of an audience knows the feeling - ''Eek! This is hideous bloody awful and I'm only halfway through!'' But she sing-songed bravely on. The manuscript began to shiver in her hand like dead weeds, and the preppies at the back of the room started sniggering, finally laughing out loud. When she finished and sank back into her seat, there was blood in the water of that Texas classroom. Twenty-nine sharks were ready to show off their literary chops, and our old philanthropist knew she deserved devouring.</p><p>Luckily, I remembered something Malcolm Cowley had taught us at Stanford - perhaps the most important lesson a writing class (not a writer, understand, but a class) can ever learn. ''Be gentle with one another's efforts,'' he often admonished us. ''Be kind and considerate with your criticism. Always remember that it's just as hard to write a bad book as it is to write a good book.''</p><p>I was able to pass this lesson on to that Texas workshop, and it worked. It was oil on bloody waters. We were all grateful.</p><p>Every writer I know teaches. At some point you have to, even if you don't have to. It's like having to yell instructions during a high school wrestling match if you used to be a collegiate grappler. You may not have been any world beater, but you had your little specialty - two or three good moves that you could pull out of your pocket, a few simple tricks like ''Look away from the half nelson!'' or ''Swing out on that bar-arm!'' For some reason, you have to yell these things, have to teach what you were taught - especially if you were taught by a great coach.</p><p>It's been my good fortune to have a number of such coaches. Bill Hammer taught me the bar-arm series - the basis of most pinning-hold combinations. In Speech 101, Robert C. Clark taught me the three secrets of good diction: ''Lips, tongue and teeth! Lips, tongue and teeth!'' And a great writer-teacher named James B. Hall revealed for me one of the keyholes of literature.</p><p>I was a junior at the University of Oregon, majoring in speech and drama. One of the requirements toward a degree was a term of television writing. My screenplay instructor told me, ''You need to learn something about story. I'm transferring you to J. B. Hall's fiction class.''</p><p>Fine with me; I loved fiction, especially the science sort. Ray Bradbury was my favorite. ''They don't get any better than Bradbury,'' I was fond of explaining. Then Professor Hall had me read a story by Ernest Hemingway called ''Soldier's Home'' and asked me to explain to the class what the story was about.</p><p>''Well,'' I shrugged, ''all I can see is it's about this guy Krebs sitting in his mother's kitchen eating breakfast. She's hollering at him about getting out of the house and getting a job and developing some interests now that the war is over, but all he wants to do is go watch his sister play baseball someplace.''</p><p>''No!'' Professor Hall said. ''Here's what it's about - here!'' He strode over in his white shoes and stabbed a finger on a paragraph in the middle of my book. ''Right after his mother has served him his bacon and eggs and is telling him how she carried him next to her heart. . . . What does Krebs do? What does he look at? Read it again - aloud.''</p><p>The paragraph was only one line long. ''Krebs looked at the bacon fat hardening on his plate.''</p><p>''That's what the story is about! That one line is the key. That line sounds the note for all the rest of the story. The whole composition would be in disharmony without that key to tune it. See?''</p>                </div>
