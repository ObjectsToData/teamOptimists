                    <p>President Bush had resisted the subject for as long as he could, believing it would be unseemly to make secret plans for a new Defense Secretary before his loyal ally from Texas, John G. Tower, was officially rejected. But by late Thursday morning the death rattle of the nomination could no longer be ignored in the Oval Office.</p><p>As Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, continued to argue for the nomination on the Senate floor and berate the Democrats for their treatment of Mr. Tower, the President began talking about new prospects for the Defense Department with John H. Sununu, his chief of staff, and Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser.</p><p>There was a sense of urgency in the room as the three men talked. They knew they had to move quickly to regain the image of being in control. And they knew that they had to choose someone who was clean enough and popular enough to glide through confirmation and meet the heightened ethical and moral scrutiny that seem likely after the Tower debate.</p><p>Mr. Sununu and Mr. Scowcroft had recreated the original list of Defense prospects and added some names. Mr. Bush had been so determined not to talk about anyone besides Mr. Tower that when White House officials went to look for the original file of names in midweek they could not find it. They had to call the secretary of Mr. Bush's former chief of staff, Craig Fuller, to track it down, one White House official recalled. Enthusiasm Is Immediate</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Sununu and Mr. Scowcroft went over the old and new names with the President. The name of Representative Dick Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who had served with Mr. Bush in the Ford Administration, was mentioned. Mr. Bush was enthusastic and told his advisers to check out the possibility.</p><p>The first time around, immediately after the election, Mr. Cheney's name had been raised. But it was not mentioned in any serious fashion, partly because of Mr. Bush's early rule that he did not want to deplete Congress of Republicans and partly of Mr. Cheney's history of heart problems and his bypass operation last year.</p><p>This time, however, Mr. Sununu and Mr. Scowcroft put aside Mr. Bush's rule, with his agreement, and focused more heavily on members of Congress as possible replacements for Mr. Tower. ''They had certain natural advantages,'' said one White House official drily. ''There were other overriding considerations this time. We had to get somebody to move in quickly and not go through another knock-down, drag-out confirmation fight or through an extensive investigation.''</p><p>As one official close to the selection process put it, ''We looked down the list of members of Congress for the kinds of people who were familiar enough with national defense to be considered, and Cheney was a natural.'' The White House Calls</p><p>Mr. Sununu called Mr. Cheney at his office and asked him to come to the White House before the Tower vote, which was slated to take place at about 4:30 P.M. Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Cheney had a Cable News Network interview scheduled at 4 P.M. After he finished, he headed for the White House, where he met with Mr. Scowcroft and Mr. Sununu at 5 P.M. in the chief of staff's office, around the corner from the Oval Office.</p><p>The two White House officials asked Mr. Cheney if he had any suggestions for other possible Defense chiefs, and then they asked him if he might be interested. When he indicated he was, according to White House officials, Mr. Scowcroft turned to Mr. Cheney and asked, ''Dick, how about your health?''</p><p>Mr. Cheney, who had suffered three mild heart attacks since 1978 and had a coronary bypass operation in August, said his cardiologist had given him a clean bill of health. The two White House officials told him to ''go back and seriously think about it,'' as one Presidential aide recalled. Reassurance From Doctor</p><p>Mr. Cheney called his doctor that afternoon and was given reassurance on the subject of his health. He reported that to Mr. Sununu, and the notion of his nomination proceeded with more confidence.</p><p>''In the time since his name came up the first time, we'd seen him at the White House, he'd been skiing and was back at work,'' said one White House official. ''People had worked with him in leadership meetings and on the issue of contra aid, and obviously he had not been slowed down by what he had been through.''</p><p>If concerns about Mr. Cheney's health and his specialized knowledge about issues like military procurement seemed to have faded, his strengths seemed more pronounced than ever, in light of the Tower debacle.</p><p>President Bush, stung by criticism that his Administration has become mired in problems with appointments and agenda, was grimly determined that this decision would be marked by speed and authority. Delays Are a Concern</p><p>''He was quite determined to get this thing done quickly, very quickly, because of all the policy things backed up,'' said one top White House official. ''That's one of the reasons why he didn't want to give up on Tower, because the switch would have entailed huge delays, and the President is very concerned that the policy machinery is backed up and there is no one at Defense to make appointments or decisions.''</p><p>But Mr. Scowcroft emphasized later that, although the decision was swift, it fit the President's requirements that the choice be someone whom he was comfortable and someone who would be a team player.</p><p>''Dick Cheney's no stranger; this is somebody who's worked with the President and with me and with Jim Baker,'' Mr. Scowcroft said, referring to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. ''It's a very warm, friendly kind of an association. We thought seriously about it and decided he fit naturally into the National Security team.''</p><p>On Thursday evening, Mr. Cheney talked it over with his wife, Lynne, the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and his two grown daughters, Elizabeth and Mary.</p><p>He also talked it over with his old friend and fishing buddy, the Secretary of State, who called him at home to urge him to accept the job. To the Private Office</p><p>Mr. Sununu and Scowcroft recommended Mr. Cheney to the President. On Friday morning, Mr. Cheney received a call to come to Mr. Bush's private office in the residential quarters of the White House. The two men talked for half an hour alone and then were joined by Mr. Sununu for another half-hour.</p><p>The President asked Mr. Cheney if he would take the job if it were offered. Mr. Cheney said that he would.  By the time the Congressman got back to his office at 2:15, the President was calling. Mr. Cheney turned around to go back to the White House to be announced at 4 P.M. as the new Defense Secretary-designate.</p><p>Before the announcement had even been made, the Federal Bureau of Investigation swung into action, calling Mr. Cheney's secretary to get names, phone numbers and addresses of key colleagues they would need to contact.</p><p>One White Hosue aide said the F.B.I. will use ''crash resources'' to finish its investigation so that the Senate can vote on the nomination before it it recesses next week.</p>                </div>
