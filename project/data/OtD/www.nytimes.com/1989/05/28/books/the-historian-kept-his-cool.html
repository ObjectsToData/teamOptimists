                    <p>ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE  A Life.  By William H. McNeill.  Illustrated. 346 pp. New York:  Oxford University Press. $24.95.</p><p>In the 1960's most educated Americans had heard of Arnold J. Toynbee (1889-1975); many had sampled his diverse historical writings, if only in excerpts. In 1947 he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine; the caption beneath his portrait held out the hope that ''Our civilization is not inexorably doomed,'' and Time's article about his theories elicited unprecedented interest. As his work was being assigned in courses and selling briskly in bookstores, he himself traveled around the country lecturing to audiences that came great distances to hear him; in 1955 he delivered 43 lectures and three talks in a mere six weeks, for lecture fees showing that even academic work could ''sell,'' at least in the form that Toynbee was able to present it. William McNeill's biography explains and analyzes the reasons, both emotional and intellectual, for Toynbee's extraordinary, though apparently ephemeral success.</p><p>Toynbee began with the assets of a capacity for concentration, abundant energy and an excellent basic education in the classics, which he acquired (on scholarships) at Winchester school and Balliol College, Oxford. After a year of walking through Greece, trying to imagine the events he had read about, he returned to Balliol as a fellow of the college, but almost immediately found teaching ancient history too confining, because he was eager to explore and understand the determining patterns behind historical development. Exempted from military service, because he had suffered from dysentery on his trip to Greece, during World War I Toynbee drafted intelligence policy on the Ottoman Empire and the Muslims of Central Asia. His war experience helped him to qualify for and win the chair in Byzantine history at the University of London. But this position also proved unsatisfactory, once its sponsors objected to Toynbee's criticism of Greek behavior in the war against Turkey in 1921. But soon Toynbee was able to find a position for which he proved to be ideally qualified, as director of the newly formed Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), which he supplemented with a professorship in international studies at the University of London. In the process of writing and editing the institute's ''Survey of International Affairs'' series, Toynbee was able to gratify his desire to learn about what was happening and had happened in the whole of the world.</p><p>Meanwhile Toynbee had married Rosalind Murray, daughter of the famous classical scholar Gilbert Murray, whose family had sufficient capital to sustain the Toynbees and their young children while Toynbee settled into his career. But, as his biographer explains, Toynbee was at best only intermittently concerned about his family; his real love was his work, which from his childhood had sustained him even in harrowing financial and emotional crises. His father suffered a mental collapse and was institutionalized when Toynbee was an undergraduate, in 1939 his oldest son committed suicide and three years later his wife left him, but throughout Toynbee was usually able to dispel depression by renewed application to his work.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. McNeill, a professor emeritus of history at the University of Chicago, draws on Toynbee's correspondence to show how he was able to maintain such a remarkable rate of productivity. An able and dedicated assistant, Veronica Boulter, helped him with every aspect of the ''Survey''; as their own expertise developed, they were able to delegate significant portions of the work to others. Although Toynbee relied increasingly on Veronica in the preparation of the ''Survey,'' by her own choice her name was modestly listed under his on the title page. She was so dedicated to Toynbee that she overcame her Christian scruples and in 1946 agreed to marry him, once it had become clear that, despite his entreaties, his first wife did not want him back.</p><p>During the 30's Toynbee began to publish what he liked to call, perhaps in order to avert hostility, his ''Nonsense Book,'' his comprehensive, 12-volume ''A Study of History,'' in which he sought to describe the reasons why civilizations rise and fall. As a young man, Toynbee had studied the work of the German historian Oswald Spengler, who argued that each great civilization followed the human tragic pattern of achievement, decline and death. Toynbee was annoyed by Spengler's dogmatism and his failure to describe connections among different civilizations; he himself sought to supply more facts about more civilizations to prove his own thesis and, perhaps most important, to show how the pattern that seemed so inexorable might be altered.</p><p>Because of his commitment to universal history, he became the first well-known historian to give priority to the study of non-European civilizations. But in his own time he was acclaimed not so much for the catholicity of his interests as for his command of facts and his abiding faith in the ideals of his own civilization. For his time, his tone was progressive; he preferred culture to savagery, monotheism to polytheism. He seemed not to try to enter into the minds of the people he wrote about, but to judge them from outside and from above as a Christian, a political liberal and an Englishman suspicious of barbarian tendencies in foreigners. In this way he managed simultaneously to inform and reassure his varied and enthusiastic audiences.</p><p>Throughout this carefully documented and eminently readable account Mr. McNeill keeps the reader aware of Toynbee's limitations, both personal and professional. But Mr. McNeill insists that nonetheless Toynbee deserves admiration, if not as a recorder of facts in the manner of today's specialist historians, at least as an artist who, like Dante and Milton, ''devoted heroic effort to the task of reaffirming and redefining the world's intelligibility in the light of everything they knew and believed to be true.''</p><p>But even if we grant Toynbee poetic license and compare his tragic view of history to that of Thucydides, it still may be reasonable to ask whether, if only by attempting less, Toynbee might better have achieved the aims he set for himself. Toynbee never seems to have questioned the assumption, common to ancient historians, that specific populations behave like individuals, and that everyone in a crowd will simultaneously think the same thought. Is it fair to say, like Toynbee, without specific reference to time and place, that ''the Hellenes came to find . . . the practice of man-worship in any form so unsatisfying'' that they turned to Christianity and Buddhism? Could or should the actual course of human events ever be so clearly and simply characterized? Toynbee seems not to have stopped reading and writing long enough to have asked himself some of these troubling questions.  THE SIMPLE TRUTH</p><p>Before Toynbee enlarged our perspective, history as studied in Western schools and taught in Western universities dealt with Europeans . . . and their descendants overseas, while other peoples entered on the scene only when discovered or civilized and conquered by Europeans. Everyone knew that India, China, and Islam also had lengthy histories; but these were special fields of inquiry, disregarded by historians. . . .  [ Toynbee ]  was able to introduce to a large portion of the world's reading public the simple truth that Asians, Africans, Amerindians . . . had a history that was independent of and analogous to the history of Europeans. The vision of a human past, cast, as he said, ''not just in western terms'' was . . . his great and central contribution to our tradition of learning, and ought to become his enduring claim to fame.
