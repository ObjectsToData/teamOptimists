    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  &quot;Malcolm X&quot; is a film that didn't have to be made to be controversial. The project has been embroiled in controversy since it was launched in 1968. At that time, a screenplay by James Baldwin and Arnold Perl was commissioned by Marvin Worth, a producer who had acquired rights to Alex Haley's as-told-to &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X.&quot; Over the years, the focus of the controversy has changed. Initially it involved Hollywood's readiness to deal with Malcolm X. Later it concerned which phase of his ideological development to emphasize. Then it focused on whether a white director could capture Malcolm's complexity.   When Spike Lee actually began filming &quot;Malcolm X&quot; for Warner Brothers last year, everybody, it seemed, had an opinion about what was in store. Within the black community, ideologues and intellectuals of every stripe -- cultural nationalists and integrationists, buppies and revolutionaries, Five Percenters and Baptist ministers alike -- wondered aloud about Mr. Lee's right to portray the complex life of Malcolm X for the big screen.">

At that time, a screenplay by James Baldwin and Arnold Perl was commissioned by Marvin Worth, a producer who had acquired rights to Alex Haley's as-told-to "Autobiography of Malcolm X." Over the years, the focus of the controversy has changed. Initially it involved Hollywood's readiness to deal with Malcolm X. Later it concerned which phase of his ideological development to emphasize. Then it focused on whether a white director could capture Malcolm's complexity.   When Spike Lee actually began filming "Malcolm X" for Warner Brothers last year, everybody, it seemed, had an opinion about what was in store.

Over the years, the focus of the controversy has changed. Initially it involved Hollywood's readiness to deal with Malcolm X. Later it concerned which phase of his ideological development to emphasize. Then it focused on whether a white director could capture Malcolm's complexity.</p><p>When Spike Lee actually began filming "Malcolm X" for Warner Brothers last year, everybody, it seemed, had an opinion about what was in store. Within the black community, ideologues and intellectuals of every stripe -- cultural nationalists and integrationists, buppies and revolutionaries, Five Percenters and Baptist ministers alike -- wondered aloud about Mr. Lee's right to portray the complex life of Malcolm X for the big screen.</p><p>In addition to battling critics like the poet Amiri Baraka, and amid reports of a conflict over Mr. Lee's insistence on a three-hour running time for the film, the director became engaged in a budget dispute with Warner Brothers. He also ran into financial difficulties. When Mr. Lee exceeded the film's $28 million budget, the Completion Bond Company, which insures investors against films going over budget, seized financial control and refused to approve further expenditures. In mid-May, Mr. Lee announced that prominent African-Americans -- among them Bill Cosby, Michael Jordan and Oprah Winfrey -- had responded to his appeal to donate money to save the film, which is now being edited.</p><p>But much of the hue and cry has been over who "owns" the image of Malcolm X, an image that evolved considerably. Here was a man who went from pimp, hustler and thief to defiant prisoner, black nationalist, and leading minister and propagandist for Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. Then -- after a visit to Mecca -- in the year before his assassination in 1965 at the age of 39, Malcolm X became a profound humanist. So forceful and incisive in life, Malcolm has, paradoxically, become a cultural and political Rorschach blot for the generations who honor his memory. The result has been considerable discussion and soul searching about the black artist's "burden of representation," as James Baldwin put it, as well as about the film itself, which is scheduled for release in November.</p>                </div>

                    <p>One afternoon recently, at Mr. Lee's 40 Acres and a Mule Studio in Brooklyn, the film maker talked with Henry Louis Gates Jr., W. .E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University and editor of Transition Magazine, about the making of "Malcolm X," and various other subjects -- among them, fact and fiction in films, his vision of Malcolm, his thoughts about black youth and the recent disturbances in Los Angeles. Here are excerpts from their conversation.  HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.: The "Malcolm X" project has been in development hell for two decades. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl, David Bradley, Calder Willingham, Charles Fuller and David Mamet were attached to the project as writers at various points. What's the real reason this movie was never made -- until now?</p><p>SPIKE LEE: I just think the studios were scared of the film. And the rising popularity of Malcolm, coupled with the box-office appeal of Denzel Washington and myself, is what made it economically feasible for them to invest in the project.</p><p>GATES: David Bradley says the writers weren't fired because the scripts were wrong; they were fired because the    story    was wrong.</p><p>LEE: I would agree with that. Malcolm X was basically disputing the American dream. And if there's one thing Hollywood is about, it is selling the American dream. So Malcolm X is at odds with the images that Hollywood has always been about.</p><p>GATES: On the other hand, he    is    the American dream: the self-made man. His story is very much like Benjamin Franklin's autobiography or Booker T. Washington's.</p><p>LEE: Yes, but the story Hollywood chooses to tell is always John Doe's, Horatio Alger's. It's never been about people of color.</p><p>GATES: What do you think about the relation between the film and the facts? Any form of narrative history involves falsification or distortion to fit a narrative framework. But in the case of Malcolm X, there's an especially heavy political freight to carry. There was a taste of this in the controversy over the historical veracity of Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." While the "Autobiography" stands as a fundamentally truthful document, individual episodes are disputed or controversial. As a film maker, do you think that matters?</p><p>LEE: It does matter. That's something every film maker or writer has to deal with when dealing with someone who has lived. I think Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." is a great movie. And the most important question you have to ask is: What is the    intent   ? Our intention is not to tear down Malcolm; for us, this is an act of love.</p>                </div>
