Teachers got plenty of it today, as 19 million Russian children started a new school year in a new country with plenty of problems.</p><p>There are shortages of money, teachers and textbooks. And in a new candor unlikely even during the most liberal days of the old Soviet Union, Education Minister Eduard D. Dneprov disclosed that across the vast expanse of Russia, 29 percent of the schools have no heat, 38 percent have no running water, and nearly half have no sewage systems.</p><p>But for Vera Muravskaya, mother of 7-year-old Ira, starting her first day in the traditional brown dress and white apron, with a white nylon bow in her blond hair and gladiolus gripped in her hand for her teacher, the feelings were as familiar as those of any mother at any time in Russian history.</p><p>"She's afraid," Mrs. Muravskaya said of Ira, who, of course, wants to be a ballerina. "But I think I'm more nervous than she is. I feel like I'm going myself."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Parents and children gathered by 7:30 A.M. in Bolshoi Vuzovsky Lane in central Moscow, outside what was once School 1227 and is now the Pokrovsky Classical Gymnasium. As usual, a little first-grader was carried aloft, ringing a bell, and the 16- and 17-year-olds, entering 11th grade, their last year here, led the first-graders by the hand into the school.</p><p>But the traditional welcoming speech by the school director, Nikolai M. Frankevich, 35, was short and nonideological. And instead of the red Pioneer scarves and pins a visitor would have once seen, there are now a few gold crosses around young necks, and a lot of eye makeup.</p><p>Ira was in traditional Russian school dress, but the older students have had no required uniform for three years now, and instead of demure blue skirts or trousers, there were jeans, sportshirts, miniskirts and even some red stockings.</p><p>Andrei Pozdnyakov, 15, wore a shirt printed with dollar bills and smoked American cigarettes, which makes him modish these days. In conversation he's polite and fascinated by chemistry and medicine.</p><p>Marya Lisyevich, 16 and a senior, wore a two-piece black outfit, with bare midriff, that might have graced a dance floor. She intends to go to Moscow State University and study Chinese. In her years at this school, which specializes in foreign languages, she's been able to study subjects like psychology, philosophy and rhetoric, as well as French and English.</p><p>She particularly likes American slang. Her favorite expression? "Oh, I like, 'It's my own business,' " she said, which may not be slang, but it's as good a theme as any for this new school year in a much-changed Russia. Why the two-piece outfit? "It's my last year," she said, "and I wanted to wear something special."</p><p>Inside, there was not a portrait of Lenin to be seen, not to mention Marx, Engels or even Boris N. Yeltsin. Mr. Frankevich, in a gray pinstriped suit, was all enthusiasm. "We think schools should be different, as all kids are different," he said, speaking in a refurbished office with a grandfather clock. Moscow University's first "classical gymnasium" -- originally a German form of secondary school -- was housed here until the gymnasiums were banished after the Bolshevik Revolution.</p><p>Mr. Frankevich is especially proud of the teachers who, with the help of teachers from Moscow State University, devised a new curriculum for 10th and 11th graders to include natural sciences and Latin taught from new texts. In April, he said, a special commission allowed the school to call itself a "classical gymnasium" again.</p><p>There are now courses in ancient history and ancient Rome, Mr. Frankevich said. For modern history, there are new texts and articles taken from contemporary journals. Rewriting History Again</p><p>"History of the Fatherland," a new textbook for Russian 11th graders, published this year, goes through the breakup of the Soviet Union last December. It gives a clear and almost neutral view of political events, speaking of deportations and the gulag, of Chernobyl and Andrei Sakharov, and how "the presence of Soviet troops" in Eastern Europe "created a powerful political and psychological background that helped Soviet supporters come to power." It treats struggles within the Communist Party as the ordinary maneuverings of ordinary men, rather than of saints or icons, and at one point speaks of the party's "political bankruptcy."</p><p>Even 5th graders get a new course concentrating on their neighborhood's history. Vladimir Bogoslovsky, a colonel in the Russian Air Force whose daughter, Masha, is entering the 6th grade, spoke appreciatively of her project last year into the environment of the neighborhood in the 16th century.</p><p>"I think education has to be different in a democratic Russia," Colonel Bogoslovsky said. "The children here are asked to do a lot of work on their own, and they act more like students and not like little soldiers."</p><p>Sex education is still a delicate topic, however. "In socialist times we closed our eyes and said there was no sex under socialism, and the problem was not really studied," Mr. Frankevich said. "But we'll solve it." Last year, he said, he showed an American sex-education video to 9th- and 10th-graders, "who reacted calmly."</p><p>Parents get very involved, he said. The richer ones have created a fund for repairs and to increase teachers' salaries to nearly 5,000 rubles a month, only about $24 these days but well above the average Russian teacher's salary of 3,600 rubles. Many teachers are going into private business or tutoring, and the Education Ministry says it needs 23,000 more secondary-school teachers.</p><p>"I never tire of telling parents they must invest money in their kids," Mr. Frankevich said. "A lot depends on who teaches them, and their environment determines what kind of people they will be."</p><p>Money is a problem for Nadezhda A. Kopylova, 51, director of a school on nearby Mechnikova Street. So she rented some space to the Moscow School of Managers, which also provides 10th and 11th graders "a commercial course," including, in Russian, "menedzhment, marketing, komputer" and "business English." It's popular, she said: "Many of our best students are in it."</p><p>Marya A. Lazerova, director of School 330 in Arkady Gaidar Street, still requires uniforms for her 500 pupils. But she is trying to introduce "extra services" for which parents will pay, like class trips and lectures by outside experts.</p><p>"A lot of parents are against it," Mrs. Lazerova said. "Not because they can't pay. But the habit of getting things for free is very strong."</p><p>She spoke dismissively of schools that pick students partly on their parents' ability to pay, because gifts are sometimes required to assure admission to reputable schools. And there is a gradual growth of the number of private schools in large cities. But those visited today are all neighborhood schools that do not charge admission; Mr. Frankevich does, however, accept students from all over Moscow to fill empty slots on the basis of a competitive interview.</p><p>Mrs. Lazerova has introduced a two-track system starting in the 8th grade for students choosing to specialize in humanities or math and science. There is also a third track for slower children, which some parents dislike as a regression from traditional socialist equality.</p><p>"The changes come so fast, a person can't change fast enough," Mrs. Lazerova said. The level of public morality is falling, she complained. "We could paint in rosy colors," she said, "but the children go out into the world and see black."</p><p>In fact, most of the schoolchildren interviewed today see the world vividly. "It's a better world than before," Marya Lisyevich, the language student, said. "There's a lot of democratic feeling."</p><p>Photo: Shortages of money, teachers and textbooks in Russian schools did not prevent continuing the tradition yesterday of schoolchildren in Moscow bringing flowers to their teachers on the first day of school.
