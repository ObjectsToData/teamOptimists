                    <p>MORT WALKER of Stamford is the scholar in residence at the University of Missouri this year. His creation, Beetle Bailey, will be the loafer in residence there, presumably for all time.</p><p>A lifesize statue of Beetle Bailey, the comic strip character that Mr. Walker created 42 years ago, is now being cast in bronze at a Bridgeport foundry and will be dedicated Oct. 23 during homecoming week at the university in Columbia, Mo.</p><p>As scholar in residence, Mr. Walker will give some lectures during the week and supervise an exhibition of comic art. He and his wife, Catherine, will be grand marshals of the homecoming parade. Beetle Bailey, of course, will be his usual indolent self, lounging on a bench, doing what he does best, nothing.</p><p>The 68-year-old Mr. Walker, who graduated from the University of Missouri in 1948 with a degree in the humanities, said the idea for a statue of the Army's classic goldbrick had come from the university's alumni association. It was created in clay by Mr. Walker's son, Neal, with his father's consultation. "I work best as a consultant," Mr. Walker said, smiling. He has cut back in recent years but still turns out a daily Beetle Bailey strip himself.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Walker believes it will be the first statue of a comic strip character to grace a college campus. It will also, he says, memorialize a place dear to his heart when he went to the university: The Shack. Born in a Booth</p><p>The Shack, which burned in 1988, was a student hangout with wooden booths carved with the names, initials and couplings of generations of students. The statue of Beetle Bailey will show him sitting in one of the booths. It will be featured outdoors on the campus, near a new alumni center and also near the site where The Shack once stood. It seems certain to be one of the most photographed places on the campus since there is space next to Beetle, on his bronze bench, for a few live persons to sit and be photographed.</p><p>The sentiment of former University of Missouri students for The Shack was evidenced when the alumni association offered to sell two-inch squares on Beetle's bench or the table in front of him, so that names, initials and sentiments would be forever cast in bronze. Some $30,000 was raised toward the cost.</p><p>No one probably has more affection for The Shack than Mr. Walker. He says Beetle Bailey was created while he sat in The Shack, quaffing something with suds on the top.</p><p>The cartoon character, whose greatest asset is goofing off, has brought Mr. Walker a measure of fame around the world. Beetle Bailey appears in some 1,800 papers in the United States but is also familiar in 52 other countries. The comic strip has also brought Mr. Walker wealth. For years he lived in a very big house in a very prestigious Greenwich neighborhood. For the past several years, he has lived in an equally splendid place in Stamford, a modern home fronted by the huge granite studio with cathedral ceiling by Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor best known for the Mount Rushmore memorial in South Dakota.</p><p>The studio contains a pool table, a full measure of comic and illustrative magazine art, and a bar that features a small bas-relief of Mount Rushmore but with Beetle Bailey added to the faces of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p>It is indicative of the humor of Mort Walker who says he is proud to be a cartoonist. "I'm utterly devoted to this business," he said. "I knew I wanted to be a cartoonist when I was three." He sold his first cartoon before he reached his teens and during high school was selling them on a regular basis.  At First, a Student</p><p>He enrolled at the University of Missouri but World War II interrupted his college education. In 1943 he was in the Army. "I went from private to sergeant, then back to private," he joked. Finally, he went to officers' candidate school, became a second lieutenant and wound up in Italy in charge of prisoners of war in the Naples area.</p><p>Discharged in 1947, he went back to college, became reacquainted with The Shack, and conceived the comic character of Beetle Bailey.</p><p>Beetle, however, was not a soldier at first. He was a student, at the fictitious Rockview University. The background of the strip, however, was the University of Missouri, including The Shack, Mr. Walker said.</p><p>He did not succeed in syndicating the comic strip until 1950 and something happened that year that decided Beetle's future: another war had started, this one in Korea. Mr. Walker decided to put Beetle in the Army. It was a decision he has never regretted.  A Spoof or a Touchstone?</p><p>Beetle in uniform was an almost instantaneous success. For more than four decades, the perennial private has never gone out of favor despite all sorts of national mood swings about the military. Mr. Walker says he believes there are two major factors in the success of the comic strip: that people who hate the military think he is making fun of it -- "I used to say I spent 4 years in the Army and 40 years getting even" -- and people who have been in the military can relate Beetle Baily's woes to their own experiences.</p><p>Basically, he says, Beetle Bailey is really a family comic strip. His family just happens to be made up of the Army characters who surround him, from the bumbling General Halftrack to Otto the Dog, who wears a uniform. "The father is Sarge," Mr. Walker said.</p><p>For years, Mr. Walker was sort of a one-man gang of the comic strip industry, involved with as many as four daily comic strips. He is a man of considerable energy and the unofficial troop leader of the coterie of comic strip artists who live in Fairfield and Westchester Counties, arranging golf matches and other social events and benefits. His overriding passion, though, has been the International Museum of Cartoon Art.  Museum Move</p><p>He founded the nonprofit museum several years ago. Its nucleus is some 3,000 pieces of comic art he amassed as a childhood fan. "I'd write to the artists, asking for the originals of a strip, and they'd send them," he said. "No one knew at the time that they could be valuable."</p><p>The museum's first home was in a mansion in Greenwich, then in a castle-like building in Rye Brook, N.Y.  That building proved too small, Mr. Walker said, for a collection that has grown to more than 100,000 original drawings, thousands of books on comic art and hundreds of hours of tapes dating to the earliest attempts at animation for motion pictures.</p><p>Now the museum is relocating to Boca Raton, Fla., and Mr. Walker is heading up a drive to raise $4 million, to supplement $2 million already in the bank, for a large new museum building. He said he was confident the museum would be ready by late 1993.</p><p>He is also working on a novel and his biography, even a musical about Beetle Bailey, which will be presented in a tryout at a dinner theater in Ohio.</p><p>Unlike Beetle Bailey, Mort Walker keeps very busy.</p><p>Photo: Mort Walker, left, created the cartoon character 42 years ago.
