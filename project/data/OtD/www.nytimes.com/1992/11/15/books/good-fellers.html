                    <p>FIDELITY   Five Stories. By Wendell Berry. 201 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $20.</p><p>WENDELL BERRY'S latest collection contains five stories that return to one of his favorite places, the fictional town of Port William, Ky., across the Ohio River from Indiana. As always, he richly evokes the region's farmland and hamlets, and his characters are fiercely individual, yet mutually protective in everything they do.</p><p>The first story, "Pray Without Ceasing," is the tale of a murder committed in the summer of 1912, 78 years before the narrator learns its details. According to a newspaper account published at the time, his great-grandfather, Ben Feltner, "friend to all," was shot to death by a farmer named Thad Coulter ("a good kind of feller, too," as one old man recalls) in a crime that has haunted Port William ever since. The narrator's grandmother knows the facts, and her recollections take up most of the story.</p><p>It seems that Coulter's son, Abner, was a young man with possibilities -- or at least so his father believed. Thad risked everything, including his farm, to set Abner up in the grocery business in the town of Hargrave, only to have Abner turn wastrel and lose everything. On the day the local bank foreclosed on his property, a drunken, grief-stricken Thad visited Ben Feltner, who had helped him buy the farm, not only to rant against injustice but also to seek "release . . . from the solitary cage of his self-condemnation." Release came, but not in the way Thad expected. And the narrator is surprised to learn that this tragedy, which shaped the destiny of two families, has created in his own life a legacy of a very different sort.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In this story and the others that accompany it, Mr. Berry's sentences are exquisitely constructed, suggesting the cyclic rhythms of his agrarian world. Seen from the distance of time, there is a definite pattern to the events of this world, which otherwise, in immediate experience, appear random and unpredictable. "He seemed to see always not only the changing road beneath his feet," Mr. Berry writes of the fugitive Thad, "but also that other world in which he had lived, now lighted in the dark behind him, and it came to him that on that day two lives had ended for a possibility that never had existed: for Abner Coulter's mounting up in a better place." Such taut phrases, filled with often painful self-awareness, recur throughout the story, providing much of its quiet beauty.</p><p>"A Jonquil for Mary Penn," which follows "Pray Without Ceasing," is not so much a fully formed tale as it is a portrait of the teen-age heroine's mental state a year and a half into her marriage. Mr. Berry presents Mary Penn on a cold March day when she feels physically ill, a rare occurrence that can perhaps be traced to her uncertainty about her 19-year-old husband and "the heavy, mostly silent force of his anger." As the story progresses, Mary broods about her husband and the farming community in which they live, pondering both Elton's dark moods and the way, in better times, he can "light up everything around him."</p><p>"Making It Home" seems to me the least original, most derivative story in the collection. Clearly inspired by Hemingway's "Big Two-Hearted River," it presents the flip side of that tale's themes. Where Nick Adams returned from World War I so shattered that even a beloved fishing stream could not calm him, Art Rowanberry comes home from World War II with a new appreciation of the Kentucky farm country that bred him and now reinvigorates him.</p><p>The title story is the most memorable. "Fidelity" tells what happens when Danny Branch and his family "kidnap" his comatose father from a Louisville hospital so the old man can avoid a long, undignified death and be buried in his native soil. It is a story of the conflict between natural and civil law, with even the police officer who represents the latter quietly giving way, preferring to "leave . . . the small, clear world of the law and its explanations and to enter the larger, darker world not ordered by human reasons or subject to them, in which he sensed obscurely that something might live that he, too, might be glad to have alive."</p><p>In a collection of essays called "What Are People For?" Mr. Berry called himself "a farmer of sorts and an artist of sorts." In this description of his vocations, we feel the characteristic tension of both his plots and his prose; without one, he cannot be the other. Like Art Rowanberry, Wendell Berry is a person who feels "the joy of a man who sees, a joy that a man tends to forget in sufficient light." A FARMER FIRST</p><p>He had crossed the wide ocean and many a river. Now not another river lay between him and home but only a few creeks that he knew by name. Arthur Rowanberry had come a long way, trusting somebody else to know where he was, and now he knew where he was himself. The great river, still raised somewhat from the flood of that spring and flowing swiftly, lay off across the fields to his left; to his right and farther away were the wooded slopes of the Kentucky side of the valley, and over it all, from the tops of the hills on one side to the tops of the hills on the other, stretched the gray sky. . . .</p><p>Art Rowanberry walked like the first man to discover upright posture -- as if, having been a creature no taller than a sheep or a pig, he had suddenly risen to the height of six feet and looked around. He walked too like a man who had been taught to march. . . . But whatever was military in his walk was an overlay, like the uniform, for he had been a man long before he had been a soldier, and a farmer long before he had been a man. . . .</p><p>The noises of the town were a long way behind him. It was too early for the evening chores, and the farmsteads that he passed were quiet. Birds sang. From time to time he heard a farmer call out to his team. Once he had heard a tractor off somewhere in the fields and once a towboat out on the river, but those sounds had faded away. . . .</p><p>Once it had seemed to him that he walked only on the place where he was. But now, having gone and returned from so far, he knew that he was walking on the whole round world. He felt the great, empty distance that the world was turning in, far away from the sun and the moon and the stars.</p><p>"Here," he thought, "is where we do what we are going to do -- the only chance we got." --    From "Fidelity."</p>                </div>
