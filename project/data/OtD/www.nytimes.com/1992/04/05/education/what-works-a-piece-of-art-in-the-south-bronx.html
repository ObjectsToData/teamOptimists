                    <p>But Jermaine liked drumming -- "not the noise, but the beat," he said.</p><p>And if anything can be said of St. Augustine's School of the Arts it is that there is a beat to the place. On almost any given day, the rhythms of the bands -- jazz, salsa, rock -- or the fuller tones of the orchestra and chorale bounce off its 95-year-old walls.</p><p>"There's a difference between the din of disorder and the noise of progress," said Thomas J. Pilecki, the school's principal, conceding with a smile, "I don't think I made that up."</p><p>The din has fallen harmoniously on Jermaine Dawson, and on dozens of other youngsters from the tough streets of the Bronx. For beyond the melodies of the music program and the spectrum of arts classes, there is a sort of "tough love" that strikes a chord for children in need of structure. 'Do Your Work'</p><p>"Do your work, period," science teacher Yvonne Rehm told one of her students recently. "When you make a commitment, you stick to it. That's what life is like."</p><p>Jermaine said he had "tried like having an attitude" during his first days at St. Augustine's. "But in this school, they'll be on your case."</p><p>In that firm, caring hand, youngsters often find renewed confidence. And then there are the drums -- as well as the pianos, the saxophones, the flutes, the guitars, the paints, the ceramics, the sculpture classes, the architecture classes, the choreography exercises, the readings from Shakespeare, all for children from kindergarten through eighth grade.</p><p>But St. Augustine's is a school of the arts, not for the arts -- a Roman Catholic school foundering with only 180 students in 1985, when it restructured its curriculum and began attracting neighborhood children in droves. Today there are 410 students, whose parents, many of them poor, manage to pay tuition of $1,500.</p><p>"We are not trying to create artists, we are trying to educate the total child," said Mr. Pilecki. "The arts are a way to a kid's heart, soul and mind, and the skills they learn in the arts are transferred and assist the children in their overall learning."</p><p>Often, he said, success in the arts "spills over" into academic areas. In Joseph Vorgity's visual arts class one recent morning, students were sketching the front of their school, from memory.</p><p>"I was just telling them," Mr. Vorgity said, "that an architect is someone who must strike a balance between math and science as well as visual design."</p><p>The children were asked to stand and speak about the school's appearance and symbolism. "Then they have to write about what they think that is," Mr. Vorgity said. "Eventually, they are going to design their own buildings."</p><p>The chairman of the school's fine arts department, Gary Schall, specializes in instrumental music, which goes beyond playing an instrument. In the music theory curriculum, for example, music is taught as a language art.  'They Are Responsible'</p><p>"We have an extensive music vocabulary and spelling list that they are responsible for," Mr. Schall said. "If they are learning a musical concept they must be able to articulate it, not just perform it. We also deal with it as a mathematical concept, exploring basic rhythms and their relationship to fractions."</p><p>In addition to basic academic subjects, all students take courses in voice, dance, graphic arts and computer technology.</p><p>From fourth through eighth grades, students take piano and another instrument. They also must take music theory, but have a choice of playing in the orchestra or a band. And they sing in the mixed chorus.</p><p>All students take humanities courses from a list that reads like a college catalogue: Gregorian chant, Romanesque architecture, Renaissance history, Victorian literature.</p><p>"When they are studying geometry, they tie it into their training in the art class for measuring and drawing shapes," Mr. Pilecki said. "In social studies, national and ethnic music is correlated with the study of particular countries."</p><p>Mr. Schall said: "In the humanities classes, they're going from the medieval period to the modern, correlating history with art history, music, literature, reflections on the scientific developments of each period, the philosophical changes from period to period."</p><p>Although St. Augustine's remains a Catholic school, only about 20 percent of its students are Catholic. Mr. Pilecki said, "We're not force-feeding the kids to become Catholics, but we do teach religion and we teach values."</p><p>Students, all in their burgundy sweaters, walk through halls lined with Monet prints or a mural of the logo from the Broadway show "Annie." In one room there are banks of electronic pianos, each with headphones. On the auditorium stage a pile of drumsticks is scattered near a folding chair with a saxophone lying across it, waiting to be played.</p><p>On one wall in a corridor of the four-story building, a poster bears the African prayer, "You, the good spirits and ancestors,  whom we have called, bless us abundantly and give us peace."</p><p>But all is not perfect tranquillity at St. Augustine's. On that recent morning, an irate parent called to complain of his child's suspension for misbehaving. And moments later, Venice Mack-Wilson, a kindergarten teacher, towed 5-year-old Frederick into the principal's office.</p><p>"I don't know what to do with him," Ms. Mack-Wilson told Mr. Pilecki. "You should just see the carpet in my room. What a mess!" Frederick -- the cuffs of his sleeves draped over his hands, his shoelaces dangling -- turned wide eyes up at Mr. Pilecki and explained, "I was cutting crayons with scissors."</p><p>Struggling to stifle a smile that might undermine his practiced stern demeanor, the principal said, "You can't just do all the things you feel like doing."</p><p>In a neighborhood where children are confronted by the reality of people too often doing what they feel like doing, the school on Franklin Avenue is a haven. As one student, Courtney Sledge, 14, wrote last year:</p><p>Follow me through the South Bronx,</p><p>I know it's dangerous,</p><p>but follow me.</p><p>I'll show you the other side,</p><p>come with me.</p><p>I'll show you the rainbow of the Bronx.</p><p>I'll show you the people</p><p>with colorful hearts,</p><p>come with me.</p><p>I'll show you how the kids play,</p><p>how the sun shines,</p><p>and how love fills the air.</p><p>Photo: Members of the orchestra rehearsing at St. Augustine's School of the Arts.
