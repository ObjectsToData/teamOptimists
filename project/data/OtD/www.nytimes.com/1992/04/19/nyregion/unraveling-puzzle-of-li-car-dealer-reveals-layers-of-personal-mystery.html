But he was thought of as the big guy in town, the very incarnation of success.</p><p>They liked it that he was a devout Roman Catholic, who seemed to go to Mass almost every morning, usually at the Infant Jesus Church here. They welcomed his charity: if anyone needed money for a good cause, he was a soft touch. And they envied his nimbleness in fashioning an empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>But now residents don't know what to think. He has become an entirely indecipherable puzzle.</p><p>John Michael McNamara -- an obstinately private local car dealer, real-estate developer, Republican Party backer and philanthropist -- is the man a Federal prosecutor says masterminded the "mother of all kiting schemes." The 52-year-old Mr. McNamara, a reserved individual with an oval face, is accused of a huge fraud in which he borrowed billions of dollars from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Mr. McNamara told the corporation, the financing branch of General Motors, that the money was going to buy cars and vans for shipment overseas, but investigators say the vehicles did not exist.

                    <p>Mr. McNamara, who was arraigned on Wednesday and freed on $300 million bail after pledging nearly everything he and his family own, has refused to comment on the accusations.</p><p>News of the purported scheme has been greeted with incredulity and also touches of black humor among Port Jefferson's 7,500 residents, many of whom are loath to accept that Mr. McNamara could be capable of such scabrous doings. The most popular joke in town is that G.M.A.C. stands for "Give McNamara Another Car."</p><p>"From the point of view of his personal character, John was outstanding," said Harold Sheprow, a former mayor of Port Jefferson. "Some kind of psychologist needs to look at this, because it didn't fit his character."</p><p>But there may have been many secrets about John McNamara that were kept from the ears of the local community. His own brother was surprised to learn that he never received a college degree. A number of people praised him as a good family man. Yet few seemed aware that he apparently has been separated from his second wife, Della, for more than a decade and lived alone with a cat. Built His Own Candy Mountain</p><p>On the surface, John McNamara was every bit the local magnate, the plucky boy who built his own big candy mountain. He was born in Woodmere, L.I., the second-oldest of five brothers. His father, Thomas McNamara, was a local Buick salesman who, in 1949, acquired the Buick-Pontiac dealership in downtown Port Jefferson.</p><p>His parents divorced in the early 1960's, and his father later remarried and had four daughters and another son with his second wife. His mother, Clara, now lives alone in Belle Terre nearby. His father, now 79, resides in Old Field, L.I., and owns the Harborside Inn in Port Jefferson. In the wake of the scandal, neighbors said, the father has hired a bodyguard and recently took his family to a home he owns on an island off the coast of Maine.</p><p>Thomas McNamara Jr., the oldest brother, described his father as strict and said he made sure the sons worked from early on. He and John both washed cars and swept up at the Buick dealership. Mr. McNamara Jr. is a lawyer in North Carolina and a former United States Attorney there. He prosecuted Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret doctor convicted of killing his family who was the subject of the Joe McGinniss book "Fatal Vision."</p><p>At Port Jefferson High School, John McNamara played football and basketball. After he graduated in 1958, he enrolled at Purdue University in Indiana, where he majored in humanities. He left for one semester to go to Long Island University, then returned to Purdue. Though he has told people that he graduated with a degree in engineering (Tom McNamara Jr. thought he had a degree), Purdue said he dropped out in 1963, before finishing his senior year. Took Over Father's Business</p><p>Returning to Port Jefferson, Mr. McNamara worked at his father's dealership. He married and had a daughter, Teresa, now in her late 20's, but the marriage did not last. In December 1977, when his father retired, John took over as president and owner of the business. It was moved to Nesconset Highway in Port Jefferson Station, a busier site.</p><p>"My father wanted me to take over the business, being the oldest," Tom McNamara Jr. said. "But I was inclined to be a lawyer, so it went to John."</p><p>In the early 1980's, Mr. McNamara began to chase grander dreams. He invested heavily in Long Island development. At the time, Port Jefferson was a somewhat shabby, sleepy town and Mr. McNamara is generally credited with doing the most to revitalize its heartbeat. Within a few years, he was the biggest owner of office buildings, stores and condominiums there.</p><p>With each passing year, his land holdings swelled until he was one of the Island's largest developers. He acquired land in Florida, and some Port Jefferson residents said he recently told them he had bought property in Germany.</p>                </div>
