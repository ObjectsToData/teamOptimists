So now she is trying to become a doctor.</p><p>As she begins her fourth year at the School of Medicine at the State University of New York campus here, Ms. Gratch represents a future direction in medical education. In the New York region and throughout the country, educators and administrators say, medical schools have been making an effort to recruit a more diverse type of student. Seeking Sensitivity</p><p>Part of the reason for this push is the theory that applicants who know about more than physics and organic chemistry will bring a more sensitive touch to the practice of medicine. But there is also a less idealistic drive at work: as medical school applications declined sharply during the last decade, students like Ms. Gratch were one way to fill the gap.</p><p>Recently however, speculation has begun within the medical community about how long this trend will continue. Applications to medical school have increased during each of the last two years, a trend that admissions officers attribute to the recession, since medicine is perceived as offering job security. The increase raises questions of what chance former actors, artists, bankers, bakers, teachers and other professionals will have in the future.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"I really feel lucky I did this when I did," Ms. Gratch said. "I'm afraid that in a year or two schools will lose interest in people like me."</p><p>Although medical school administrators say they do not keep separate tallies of how many so-called nontraditional students are being admitted, most agree that the number has been increasing.</p><p>"There has been a move afoot for some time now to deliberately diversify the population of medical students," said Richard Green, a spokesman for the Association of American Medical Colleges, which last year added an essay section to the medical college admission test (MCAT). "They are trying to give people who may not consider themselves typical medical students a chance to compete. And they are trying to send a message to the typical science geeks and say you will have to know more than organic chemistry, you'll have to know how to think and write."</p><p>How well the nontraditional students do in medical school remains unclear because schools do not keep particular track of them and their grades. It is also too soon to tell how they perform as doctors since most of them have only recently graduated.</p><p>Medical schools interested in this type of student are sending their message with varying degrees of formality. At Stony Brook, for instance, which has a reputation for attracting nontraditional students, the message is spread by word of mouth. "We have let it be known that we are hospitable to people with unusual training," said Dr. Pierce Gardner, associate dean for academic affairs, "and they come find us." Looking for Students</p><p>At Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in contrast, recruiters go out and look for students. Since 1987, nearly one-quarter of the 115 spaces in each medical school class has been reserved for students with liberal arts backgrounds. Each year Kenneth D. Smith, director of the Humanities and Medicine Program at Mount Sinai, has been making regular visits to Amherst College, Williams College, Brandeis University, Wesleyan University and Princeton University to persuade liberal arts majors to try medical school.</p><p>The nontraditional students are a varied group. Some, like David Landis, knew all through college that they wanted to go to medical school but decided to take time off before they began. Mr. Landis, who is now in his fourth year at Stony Brook, graduated from the University of Chicago in 1987 and spent a year running his own bread-baking business.</p><p>Others, like Ms. Gratch, never thought about medicine until they were long out of college. After graduating from Catholic University in Washington in 1977, she spent more than 10 years working as a waitress and an actress, finally landing the job that had been her goal: a full-time position in a classical repertory company. "Once I got where I wanted to be, I realized it wasn't enough," she said. "It wasn't challenging enough mentally or emotionally. Art is a kind of a luxury and health care is a necessity. It's more important somehow." A Sudden Rescue</p><p>Lisa Sanders reached a very similar conclusion. Ms. Sanders, who has been accepted at several medical schools, spent more than 10 years as a television researcher and producer. One afternoon about four years ago, she was accompanying the CBS reporter Robert B. Arnot, who is also a medical doctor, on a story near a lake. While reciting his lines for the camera the reporter noticed a woman floating face down in the water. Still wearing his microphone Dr. Arnot jumped into the lake, dragged the woman to shore and saved her life with cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p>"I watched him change from a journalist who watches things to a doctor who does things," she said. "It made me realize I'm not a person who wants to just sit around and watch."</p>                </div>
