                    <p>After all, Fox has loudly attributed its success in establishing itself as a viable fourth network to its willingness to take risks, to look for programs "with an edge" or "an attitude." This has led to many bold, attention-getting and borderline tasteless shows on Fox. Certainly, "Studs" fits that description.</p><p>Even Jay Leno could not resist taking a shot at Fox last week. In his "Tonight" show monologue, he referred to Mr. Chao's dismissal for demonstrating poor taste. "This is the Fox network," Mr. Leno said. "Isn't that why he was hired in the first place?"</p><p>The impression of Fox as the network most likely to transcend the boundaries of good taste has been a byproduct of Fox's well-executed plan to become the network most likely to be watched by viewers under the age of 25. Irreverence plays well with a young audience.</p><p>From the outrageously gay movie reviewers on "In Living Color" to the anti-establishment cracks of Bart Simpson, Fox has been strong on irreverence. But it has also had shows full of jokes about overweight women ("Babes"), about dead people ("Good Grief") and, of course, about sex -- and the lack of it -- for the most dysfunctional family on television ("Married With Children").</p><p>In that atmosphere, Mr. Chao may have felt somewhat comfortable pulling the striptease stunt, even at a management conference on June 19 staged by Fox's parent, Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. The forum he chose was a panel discussion on "the threat to democratic capitalism posed by modern culture."</p><p>The audience included Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; his wife, Lynne, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and other figures from conservative and Republican circles, as well as Mr. Murdoch and his wife, Anna.</p><p>Mr. Murdoch later said that Mr. Chao, who was trying to make a point about censorship and free speech, had made "a terrible misjudgment."</p><p>But Fox's critics felt it was a fair question to ask if Mr. Chao would have been similarly reprimanded if he appeared before the same group and showed a few minutes from "Studs" -- perhaps a shot of contestants answering questions like "Which is the guy who has bounce in his butt?" or "Which one is more likely to find the G-spot?"</p><p>The prize for a winning contestant on this game show is a "dream date."</p><p>To some, it seemed Fox was displaying a double standard: an outrageous and, to some, vulgar act is cause for dismissal in a private setting in front of distinguished guests; but outrageous and, to some, vulgar material is both acceptable and marketable in the public setting of broadcast television, where the guests are just the unwashed masses.</p><p>Longtime critics of Mr. Murdoch, looking to make the same point about a double standard, also cited the fact that his British tabloids run photographs of naked women.</p><p>A Fox spokesman, Dennis Petroskey, said Mr. Chao was dismissed not just because his actions were deemed "inappropriate" but also because they were "unauthorized." One of the oldest maxims of business, of course, is don't surprise the boss.</p><p>"This is something we have always contended with," said Jon Nesvig, the senior vice president of sales for Fox. "You want to keep an edge in what you do. You don't want to go over the edge. Sometimes, we have gone over the edge and we've pulled back. We've said we're going to take risks. But if you go too far, if you go over the edge, you fall off the end of the world. That's what happened here."</p><p>Fox executives said the loss of Mr. Chao would have no effect on their ambitious plans to expand in prime time next season. Nor, they said, will his dismissal for being too bold have a chilling effect on Fox's program executives, headed by Peter Chernin, who is credited with several of the boldest and biggest hits in recent years, including "In Living Color" and "Beverly Hills 90210."</p><p>Fox is also going ahead with its plans to start a full-fledged news service, which had been Mr. Chao's main project.</p><p>As for "Studs," its ratings have grown each week in the last month. It will probably live on for some time as Mr. Chao's legacy.</p><p>Photo: "Studs," with Mark DeCarlo as host, is Fox's sexually suggestive game show, with a "dream date" as a prize.
