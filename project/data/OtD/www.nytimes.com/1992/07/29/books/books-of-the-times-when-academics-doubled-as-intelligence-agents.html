                    <p>Compromised Campus  The Collaboration of Universities With the Intelligence Community, 1945-1955  By Sigmund Diamond  371 pages. Oxford University Press. $27.95.</p><p>It should not come as a surprise to readers of recent books and magazine articles about the reign of J. Edgar Hoover during the cold war that the tentacles of the Federal Bureau of Investigation extended into the nation's universities. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, in recent years historians, biographers and journalists have been able to obtain Government dossiers -- heavily censored and often with pages withheld -- on individuals and organizations ranging from America's Nobel laureates in literature to members of Congress and the Supreme Court.</p><p>In "Compromised Campus," Sigmund Diamond, Giddings Professor of Sociology and Emeritus Professor of History, Columbia University, adds fuel to the bonfire of the liberties. Citing F.B.I. files and his own observations, he reveals that for at least 10 years after World War II, Hoover's special agents in charge enlisted administrators and professors and planted them as subagents in place.  Professor Diamond maintains that such college officials and faculty members were more than willing to report to the F.B.I. about colleagues they suspected of being disloyal Americans. He finds that some did so for patriotic reasons, others to advance their careers on campus or later in Washington.</p><p>Professor Diamond's theme builds on information already existing in the study of McCarthyism and Hoovermania, which are linked because the Senator and the Director worked together closely. Among the most revealing books in the field is Ellen Schrecker's "No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities." The leading expert on domestic surveillance without judicial fiat, Prof. Athan Theoharis of Marquette University, obtained thousands of F.B.I. documents and interpreted them in such valuable books as "Spying on Americans" and "From the Secret Files of J. Edgar Hoover." Presidents and Presidential aspirants, Federal employees, newspapers, networks, film studios, guilds, unions and civil rights leaders all were shown to have F.B.I. files, usually without their knowledge or an opportunity to challenge faceless accusers.</p>                </div>

                    <p>As Professor Theoharis and other authors have demonstrated, sometimes spying was done upon an organization's members by its own officials. In the best-known case, Ronald Reagan, while president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947, served as an informer, assigned the code name Agent T-10, for the Los Angeles office of the F.B.I. Similarly, Professor Diamond cites examples of university officials who collaborated with the agencies he classifies together as the intelligence community: the F.B.I., the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department.</p><p>In "Compromised Campus," the author devotes special attention to individuals he considers collaborators with the F.B.I. during the early 1950's, based on files he unearthed under the Freedom of Information Act. They include, from Harvard, McGeorge Bundy, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences; Henry A. Kissinger, a teaching fellow who was executive director of an international seminar, and William Yandell Elliott, a professor of government described as Mr. Kissinger's mentor.</p><p>At Yale, the author singles out William F. Buckley Jr., onetime editor of the Yale Daily News, calling him "the F.B.I. informer as Yale intellectual," and Harry B. Fisher, the F.B.I.'s liaison on campus, "an undercover employee of Yale University for 25 years, whose last 15 years of service were devoted mainly to political surveillance."</p><p>Professor Diamond, who received his Ph.D. in American history at Harvard, seems to be paying off an old score against Mr. Bundy, presenting some accounts that have been previously argued in the pages of The New York Review of Books. The author writes that he was dismissed from an administrative job, which included teaching duties, because Dean Bundy wanted him to disclose the political beliefs of former colleagues and "cooperate by giving the names to the authorities." He responded that he was willing to talk about himself but would decline to discuss others.</p><p>The author devotes two chapters to the Russian Research Center at Harvard, which was the special province of the Boston F.B.I. office. "The Russian Research Center was the locus of fruitful collaboration between the intelligence agencies and Harvard, fruitful but not entirely free of tension," he writes. Citing internal reports between Boston and Washington that he managed to obtain by diligent digging, Professor Diamond adds, "The F.B.I. had its version of the history of the Russian Research Center, and its documents make clear how it intruded in the affairs of the center." In one case, Professor Diamond writes, "a slip by the F.B.I. censor" indicates that Isaiah Berlin, the distinguished British diplomat, author and philosopher, was kept under surveillance by Charles Baroch, a "confidential informant" who was a graduate student at the center.</p><p>Professor Diamond says that the F.B.I. watched faculty members who were considered politically suspect.  In 1969, the bureau's campus informant (whose name was deleted from the records) reported that two humanities professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had been denied reappointments after their dossiers were provided to school officials. The "chilling" evidence of cooperation between the F.B.I. and M.I.T. "in matters of faculty appointments and promotions," the author writes, occurred "well after the F.B.I. was supposed to have reformed itself."</p><p>An unfortunate flaw in "Compromised Campus" is the author's mixture of the personal and the general.  The reader sometimes is confused by the leaps between the author's own experience and his broader theme of the existence of an academic-intelligence complex. Yet when Professor Diamond sticks to the documents in the F.B.I. files -- especially when quoting the special agents in charge in Boston and New Haven about their sources on campus -- he justifies his conclusion that the most eminent colleges collaborated with the intelligence community.</p><p>Photo: Sigmund Diamond</p>                </div>
