                    <p>The sentiment was also echoed by bit players in the world of culture. "It saddens me to think where America is going, and that the endowment is going to be more conservative," said Arthur Nersesian, an adjunct professor of literature at Hostos Community College in the South Bronx. Mr. Nersesian is managing editor of The Portable Lower East Side, a semi annual literary journal that received a $5,000 grant from the endowment and has been attacked in recent weeks as obscene and blasphemous by conservative groups and members of Congress.</p><p>One of the journal's publications, a 168-page collection of poetry titled "Queer City," makes a sexual reference to Jesus.</p><p>On Friday, a member of the White House staff and Administration officials who would speak only on condition of anonymity said that although Mr. Frohnmayer had discussed leaving the endowment with President Bush in October, he made no move to depart and was forced to resign late last week by Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff.</p><p>His resignation came amid reports that Patrick J. Buchanan, President Bush's conservative challenger for the Republican Presidential nomination, planned to make an issue of Mr. Bush's support for the endowment as he campaigned in the South.</p><p>Representative Yates called Mr. Frohnmayer "a victim on the altar of Pat Buchanan and the conservative wing of the Republican party."</p><p>The President's letter accepting Mr. Frohnmayer's resignation praised his "integrity and decency," but it also caustically observed that "some of the art funded by the N.E.A. does not have my approval." There were reports, which the White House would neither confirm nor deny, that President Bush had seen or been told about the reference to Jesus in "Queer City."</p><p>Mr. Frohnmayer had defended the endowment's support of the publication, arguing in a public statement that the reference had been "taken out of context and sensationalized."</p><p>Although Mr. Frohnmayer wobbled in his support for artists who expressed strong social comment or graphic sexual themes during his two and a half years in office, in the last few months he became a vociferous advocate of no-holds-barred free expression, and thus became an inviting target for conservatives.</p><p>The issue of permissiveness during his tenure was characterized by, but was not limited to, solo performance artists like Karen Finley, who smears her body with chocolate to simulate excrement, and Tim Miller, who simulates masturbation onstage.</p><p>At a conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters in New York City in December, Mr. Frohnmayer said he had recently read the Bill of Rights "100 times" and concluded with an emotional promise to make "sacrifice" for the cause of freedom of expression. On Friday, his announcement to his staff of his departure reportedly took on the color of a revival meeting, in which Mr. Frohnmayer sang a hymn, read poetry and recited a credo in which he characterized the years in which he had been criticized for the permissiveness of some grants as an "eclipse of the soul." Speculation on a Successor</p><p>Over the weekend there was intense speculation about how President Bush might seek to restore a more moderate, if not vigorously conservative, tone to the agency.</p><p>Mr. Yates said he had heard rumors of a move in Congress to combine the arts endowment with the National Endowment for the Humanities, a sister agency with a similar budget of about $170 million that makes grants for research in language, history and the other humanities. "I think that would be unfortunate," he said.</p><p>Jacob Neusner, a professor of religious studies at the University of South Florida at Tampa, whose term as a member of the National Council on the Arts expired in September 1990, said he expected the President to appoint as Mr. Frohnmayer's successor a strong conservative like William J. Bennett, former director of national drug control policy and Secretary of Education, or Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>Ms. Cheney concedes that she overrules a number of grant recommendations at each quarterly meeting of the advisory National Council on the Humanities. As a result, her agency has fended off most critics and kept out of the headlines.</p><p>"Where John Frohnmayer went wrong, and Frank Hodsell before him, was when we enlarged the category of mime to include solo performance artists," Mr. Neusner said. "At the time, only Sam Lipman on the Council opposed the idea, but the rest of us thought it was innocuous. But that, in fact, opened the gates to a lot of stuff that really isn't art. The chairman should have recognized that and stopped it. I think a strong chairman in the future will do so."</p><p>Anne G. Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, which lobbies the Government for support for the arts, said: "There's a possibility that the President will name as a successor a high-powered person like Beverly Sills who couldn't be effectively challenged, but my guess is that he has nothing to gain by naming a successor until after the election."</p><p>Wendy Luers, a member of the National Council on the Arts and president of the Charter 77 Foundation-New York, which assists the democratization of Czechoslovakia, said: "Bush really doesn't need to do anything now. Nothing will stop the far right from attacking the endowment, no matter what it does, and if their attacks begin to hurt, he can say: 'Things will get better. I've already gotten rid of the bad guy.' "</p><p>Samuel Lipman, the publisher of The New Criterion, a neo-conservative monthly journal of the arts, and a former member of the National Council on the Arts, said: "Before nominating a new chairman, the President may initiate an open discussion on the role of the N.E.A. and on what in general terms it should support. Because past discussions of these matters have taken place only in private, there is now no broad public consensus on the agency."</p><p>Roger L. Stevens, who was the first chairman of the arts endowment under President Lyndon B. Johnson, said: "I don't see that the cure for the problem, if there is one, is to make the endowment like the commissars of the old Russia, but maybe the endowment should make a better distinction between the attention-grabbers and showoffs who are not real artists, and those who are genuine artists."</p><p>Representative Yates said: "I've thought of that, too. How do you tell the difference between somebody who just paints a nude and Goya's 'The Naked Maja?' I want to give it more thought."</p><p>Photo: John E.
