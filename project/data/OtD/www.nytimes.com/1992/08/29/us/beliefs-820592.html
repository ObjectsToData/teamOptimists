                    <p>The Big Bang, in turn, might be the scientific face of divine creation, the instant "in the beginning," when God created the heavens and the Earth.</p><p>Was this a vindication for biblical religion, a repudiation of the theories of continuous creation that had held sway in science for most of the 20th century and seemed incompatible with the dramatic actions in Genesis?</p><p>There were religious figures quick to make that claim, of course, but surprisingly few. Scientific enthusiasts and the mass media seemed far more interested in Big Bang theology than theologians. Why did so many of the latter keep a guarded distance, with several prominent thinkers actively dampening the talk of Big Bang proving God's existence?</p><p>Insufficient scientific knowledge is probably one reason. The breach between science and the humanities was magnified by the 19th-century war between evolutionary science and theology. Before the fighting subsided, the theologians took the heavier losses, and have been wary of wandering near the border ever since.</p><p>But past conflicts with science may not be as worrisome to the theologians as the memory of past alliances that proved illusory. Science is apt to kick away next year any prop that religion uses this year. Indeed, there are interpretations of the Big Bang -- Stephen Hawking's is one -- that do not appear to resolve the old debate about whether the universe had a distinct moment of beginning because they raise fundamental questions about the conventional notion of time.</p><p>Basing a relationship with one's God on the latest finding in physics is like basing a relationship with one's child on the latest turn in child psychology.</p><p>Moreover, just as the God of the philosophers is not the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, neither is the God of the astrophysicists. Is God to be understood on the analogy of a loving parent or a just monarch? Is God the "clockmaker" of deism who does not intervene once the cosmos is all wound up and set in motion? Is God an indifferent force or perhaps even a satanic demi-urge, as some ancient philosophies and modern Romantics have suggested? The Big Bang does not tell us.</p><p>Obviously, the Big Bang does not prove the literal truth of the Book of Genesis, with its creation in 144 hours. It also does not prove the major points that non-literalists draw from that account: that Creation is a triumph of order over chaos, that the result is good, that humanity plays a central role in it, and that the created order is distinct from a Creator who nonetheless continues to sustain and watch over it.</p><p>There is yet another reason theologians have been low key in their reception of the latest news from outer space. Curiously enough, this ultimate cause for hesitation arises not from the past divergences between science and religious faith, but from a growing awareness of their similarities.</p><p>It is increasingly recognized that the validity of both scientific theory and religious conviction is not demonstrated by any one decisive "proof." Although scientific hypotheses may be confirmed or confuted by controlled experiments or systematic examination of evidence, the results are often ambiguous or approximate. Particular findings can usually be fitted, with sufficient pushing and shoving, into different theories. And there is almost always some obstinate data that a given theory cannot account for, just as the shortcomings of equipment and experimenters frequently introduce a margin of error.</p><p>Whichever theory proves superior will be an overall judgment by the scientific community, working with certain standards that it has inherited. Like a jury, it will reach its conclusions on the preponderance of the evidence, presented according to the rules of the court and not as a matter of clean-cut mathematical demonstration. Science turns out to be more of an "art," and more a matter of community judgment, than had generally been thought -- more, in other words, like religion.</p><p>How far these parallels can be pushed is a matter of debate. Differences between science and religion remain. But as scientific truth is seen in a new way, religious thinkers are naturally not drawn to emulate the old understanding of science in their account of religious truth.</p><p>They are happy if the Big Bang's big boost last April removes some of the obstacles to belief in a creator God and a created universe. But they know that religious faith, whether biblical, Eastern or any other, cannot be erected on a pivotal, logical or neatly demonstrable proof. Such a faith stands or falls because, as lived by its adherents, it provides an overall pattern that, despite ambiguities and unexplained contradictions, makes the most sense of their total experience.                    --------------------</p><p>A report in Religion Notes last Saturday misidentified a Southern Baptist minister convicted of sexual assault.
