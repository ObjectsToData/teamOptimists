At first, the work of the student, Randall L. Skalsky, was given anything but a friendly reception by classicists, a group notorious for being slow to accept anything new; indeed, his monograph was savagely rejected by the editors of several scholarly journals. Then, in the last few weeks, he began to pick up supporters, chief among them Dr. Richard Brilliant, a professor of art history and archeology at Columbia University and a widely published authority on ancient Roman art. He is also editor in chief of The Art Bulletin, a leading academic journal in the field.">

                    <p>By deciphering a frieze on the ancient Portland vase, one of the world's most famous glass objects, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts appears to have solved a mystery that has intrigued scholars ever since the vase was discovered in the 16th century.</p><p>At first, the work of the student, Randall L. Skalsky, was given anything but a friendly reception by classicists, a group notorious for being slow to accept anything new; indeed, his monograph was savagely rejected by the editors of several scholarly journals. Then, in the last few weeks, he began to pick up supporters, chief among them Dr. Richard Brilliant, a professor of art history and archeology at Columbia University and a widely published authority on ancient Roman art. He is also editor in chief of The Art Bulletin, a leading academic journal in the field.</p><p>In a letter to Mr. Skalsky last month offering to publish the paper in his journal, Professor Brilliant compared the student's ingenuity to that of the designer of the vase and to the Roman poet Catullus, whose poem "The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis," Mr. Skalsky argues, holds the key to understanding the ancient Roman frieze. By the time Professor Brilliant's letter reached Mr. Skalsky, Arion, a thrice-yearly journal devoted to the classics and humanities, had accepted the article and now plans to publish it with a special color fold-out in its May issue. Two Intriguing Scenes</p><p>The elegantly crafted frieze on the Portland vase, so named after it was purchased by the Duchess of Portland in the 18th century (it was later sold to the British Museum), depicts two scenes that are as compelling as they are obscure. In both scenes, a young reclining woman is at the center. In one, this central figure is flanked by a young man and a mature man; in the other, by a young man and a mature woman. The scenes also include tantalizing figures of a snake, a winged Cupid and a horned and bearded mask. The intensity and focus of the eyes of all of the figures makes it clear that    something    dramatic is taking place, but exactly what has long mystified scholars.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Since the 1630's, a half-century after the discovery of the vase, no fewer than 44 interpretations of the scenes have been advanced. For example, the striding figure at the far left in the position scholars designate as "A" has been variously thought to represent Alexander the Great, Paris, Peleus, Orpheus, Adonis, Pluto, Alexander Severus, Bacchus, a ghost, a soul, Pylades, Theseus, Apollo Veiovis, Marcellus, Dionysus, Achilles, Apollo, Perseus and Augustus.</p><p>Disagreements have intensified in recent years as a replica of the Portland vase attracted scholarly attention in major international exhibitions in Corning, N.Y., and in Rome. The actual vase also took center stage in an important show of Roman glass at the British Museum from 1987 to 1989.</p><p>Mr. Skalsky said he had selected the vase as the subject of a research paper for a course in Roman art because he was intrigued by the challenge of an artwork widely believed to be an elaborate and subtle puzzle whose creator might have taken as long as two years to plan and execute it, and also because none of the solutions had satisfied scholars.  From Waiter to Student</p><p>Mr. Skalsky, now 43 years old, is not a typical graduate student. After finishing high school in Syracuse, he worked for the next 16 years as a waiter and in other jobs at hotels and restaurants in the South. He did not resume his education until 1987 at the College of Charleston, S.C., where he majored in classical languages and graduated with a B.A. degree. By then he had acquired several thousand books, most of them relating to the classics, a long-held interest awakened, he says, by a high school Latin teacher. He started graduate work in the fall of 1990 -- he will shortly be inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society -- and is to receive a master's degree in May.</p><p>"I began thinking that people have been contemplating the figures on this vase for 400 years, always seizing on one singular detail in them, like the snake, and basing their whole interpretation on just that," Mr. Skalsky said in a recent interview. "So I decided to stop looking at the figures, and when I did so the architecture jumped out at me."</p><p>"It hit me that the first piece of architecture in the frieze represents the Greek letter pi, or P," Mr. Skalsky continued. "Then I looked at the second pillar and it seemed as though it was the Greek letter iota, or I."</p><p>Pi is formed by two verticals with a horizontal bar across the top; iota is a single vertical that looks much like a capital I. Together, of course, pi and iota spell pi, and that suggested to Mr. Skalsky that pi was the key to the frieze.</p><p>"If so," he said, "the name of the figure within the pi-like architecture would begin with the letter P, perhaps the mythological hero Peleus."</p><p>That led Mr. Skalsky to Catullus's poem "The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis," which was very popular during the reign of Augustus, at the beginning of the Christian era, when the vase was carved. He said he realized that the figure and the architecture in position "A" were a visual representation of an image in the poem. "Previous scholars had speculated that the frieze might represent the version of the story of Peleus and Thetis told by Catullus," he said, "but no one had seen that the frieze might be a direct visual representation of it."</p>                </div>
