The proof is right there on the map, one of 99 representations of the landscape of antiquity in a new atlas of the Greek and Roman world.</p><p>On the map are roads coming from Portus and Ostia, the port cities. Via Appia, the Appian Way, shooting up from the south, straight as an arrow. Via Clodia, Via Sataria, Via Tiburtina, all dropping down from the hills, which were also the source of the many dotted lines for the aqueducts that brought water to the metropolis.</p><p>One look and it is clear that the Romans, whose capital at the peak of the empire was a grand city of perhaps one million people, deserved their reputation as master engineers and road builders. And maps of these roads and the rest of the landscape are seen by scholars as fundamental to understanding the classical world.</p><p>''These roads were a very distinctive feature of Roman society,'' said Dr. Richard J. A. Talbert, editor of ''The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World,'' which was published in October by Princeton University Press. ''Building so many roads required tremendous resources and a centralized organizing capacity. The Greeks didn't see the need, but the Romans did, and this tells us something important about the two.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Nicholas Purcell, a classics professor at Oxford University in England, who supervised preparation of the map incorporating Rome and environs, said the network of cities and the roads that linked them was ''the most visible single element of the map'' and that it appears to have been ''a distinctly less sudden phenomenon than it did to earlier generations of researchers.''</p><p>As the scholars and cartographers discovered, Dr. Purcell said, many of the Roman foundations of the fourth to second centuries B.C. turned out to be ''reworkings or relocations of earlier cities.''</p><p>This is but one example, the editors said, of why historians, archaeologists and other scholars are expected to pore over the maps in this atlas for years to come. They will be searching the spatial relationships for better understanding of long-ago cultures and the early history of Western civilization and will be plotting their new discoveries within the coordinates of these maps.</p><p>''We can't fully understand the world of the Greeks and Romans without good maps, maps that show their world,'' said Dr. Talbert, a professor of history and classics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ''In this atlas, we are showing their world in far more depth and breadth than anyone has before.''</p><p>The atlas was a long time in preparation and is considered the first comprehensive collection of such maps in more than 130 years. Started in the 1980's under the auspices of the American Philological Association, the project involved more than 70 international historians and archaeologists working under Dr. Talbert's direction. Each map was researched, drawn and checked by a specialist in that area and then reviewed by several other experts.</p><p>In most cases, cartographers started with satellite-generated charts of the areas to be mapped. Working with historians and geographers, they used computers to subtract all aspects of the modern landscape -- railroads, man-made lakes, highways and urban sprawl -- and then identified all the ancient names and places to be included as part of the ancient landscape.</p><p>The individual maps cover time from about 1000 B.C. to A.D. 640 and space from the British Isles to India and deep into Africa. The maps cover not only lands that Greeks and Romans lived in or conquered, but also anywhere they may have traded or traveled. Maps of lands bordering the Mediterranean run the gamut of time, while those for Britain depict the land from the time of the Roman conquest in the first century A.D. and those for parts of Asia begin with Alexander the Great's conquests in the fourth century B.C.</p><p>The atlas comes with a map-by-map directory on CD-ROM, which contains background information on every place and feature. The directory is also available separately in print form as a two-volume companion priced at $150. The atlas plus CD-ROM sells for $325.</p><p>In the directory for the map of Rome and environs, for example, Dr. Purcell wrote of the problems overcome and the shortcomings remaining on that chart. Earthquakes have so changed the topography, he said, that it was difficult to re-create some of the terrain in antiquity. No attempt was made to represent Mount Vesuvius as it was before or just after the destruction of Pompeii.</p><p>Similar problems were encountered in Egypt, where the map makers were unable to reliably reproduce the course of the waterways in the Nile delta during antiquity.</p><p>The Barrington Atlas was produced at a cost of $4.5 million, an unusually large sum for a project in the humanities. Most of the money came from the Barrington Foundation, a family philanthropy; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the American Philological Association; and the University of North Carolina.</p><p>The School of Arts and Sciences at Chapel Hill is supporting the establishment of an Ancient World Mapping Center there as a clearinghouse for new information on the geography of antiquity and for revisions in atlases. The cartography for the atlas was supplied by MapQuest.com.</p><p>Some of the most heated disputes erupted over how to draw the maps of some of the more remote territories, like Armenia, eastern Turkey and Arabia. Sometimes the different views were hard to reconcile; often in that case, to be cautious, the disputed area was left blank.</p><p>Dr. Talbert sighed, ''What would scholars be without arguing?''</p><p>Chart: ''Antiquity's Landscape''  READING THE MAP  Underline color  means date range.  In this case, 30 B.C.  to A.D. 300    Major roads    A LOOK AT TWO MAPS  Water for Rome came from lakes beyond the city, such as Sabatinus Lake. The course of aqueducts is marked by dotted lines. Where there is uncertainty about the course, the dots are more widely spaced.    Hadrian's Villa, early second century A.D., was one of the largest and most opulent of the country retreats built by an emperor.    Portus and Ostia are seaports here, as they were in antiquity. The sea has since receded, leaving them somewhat inland.    Neapolis is the forerunner of modern Naples.    Capua is thought to have been a settlement of the pre-Roman Etruscan culture.    Capreae is the island of Capri.    An eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried the town of Herculaneum and the resort of Pompeii, leaving time capsules of life at the height of the empire. The contours of Vesuvius are only an approximation of what they were in antiquity.    Grid patterns like this represent land that had been surveyed and divided into plots for settlement and cultivation. They were called centuriated landscapes.
