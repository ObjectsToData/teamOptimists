                    <p>The students in a freshman English class at Vassar College have missed the deadline for the first assignment of the semester, but it is their professor who is making the excuses. They were given wrong directions for gaining access to the class Web site. Their passwords did not work. Now their papers have been lost in an electronic netherworld.</p><p>''Don't worry; we can turn in the papers tomorrow,'' said Prof. Michael Joyce, trying to reassure 19 anxious students clicking away on iMac computers. ''I know you did the writing. Let's give this some time to work. Even if, God forbid, you lost your first writing, we'll deal with it.''</p><p>Several students groaned, but such are the risks of signing up for a class on hypertext fiction -- poetry and stories that unfold through a series of mouse clicks so that readers can experience different endings and plot twists not found in more conventional fiction. Later that day, the college's computer technicians solved the problem, but not before the students had spent many extra hours in front of their computers.</p><p>Despite occasional mishaps like this, a technological revolution is transforming the way that English, art history and other humanities classes are being taught at tradition-steeped liberal arts colleges like Vassar, where afternoon tea is still served in a rose-hued parlor in the main building. Students now read hypertext poems along with Shakespeare, and research the old masters on the World Wide Web. At Vassar and at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., students practice German in cyberspace chat rooms. And students at Reed College in Portland, Ore., analyze poetry through interactive tutorials and choreograph dances with computer-generated ballerinas.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The technology has opened up new possibilities, and has evolved from being just a tool to become an integral part of curriculums. During a recent intermediate-level German class at Vassar, 23 students honed their language skills in chat rooms known as MOO's (an acronym for multiple-user domains, object oriented). They animatedly discussed three essays and corrected one another's grammar -- all without uttering a word or looking up from their iMac screens. Twice a week they log into the chat rooms, where they type their German sentences. They spend a third session in a traditional class practicing their pronunciations.</p><p>Afterward, several students said they felt more comfortable making a slip-up in the relative anonymity of cyberspace than in a crowded classroom. Tani Thole, 18, a freshman who is still refreshing her rusty German, said, ''When I'm in the MOO, I'm always talking constantly, but in class I don't say anything.''</p><p>Still, officials at Vassar and other liberal arts colleges often approach technology with caution and even outright suspicion. Perhaps more so than large research universities, they are keenly aware that technology can strain their limited budgets, gobble up precious faculty time and, at worst, distract from what is being taught. If not carefully integrated into the curriculum, these officials say, technology can undermine academic traditions that have come to define the most prestigious schools: small discussion groups, close personal relationships with professors and the time-honored Socratic method of inquiry.</p><p>''There's a lot of anxiety over what technology might do,'' said Scott Siddall, an environmental studies professor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, and chairman of the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges, 59 private colleges that have jointly explored uses of technology since 1986. ''The face-to-face contact is our staple. The scholarship of the faculty is a staple. The spice of the recipe is the technology. It can make or break the recipe, but it shouldn't be overused.''</p><p>Even so, Professor Siddall and other college officials acknowledge that they cannot afford to overlook the new technology, either, at a time when they must compete for a pool of students largely raised on computers.</p><p>A recent survey of the consortium's members found that at least one-quarter of college faculty members, and often many more, reported using technology in an innovative way -- beyond just corresponding with students by e-mail or posting a syllabus on the Web. ''Ten years ago, technology was a computer administration department that handled payroll,'' Professor Siddall said. ''Today, it's one of the four or five top strategic issues for our schools.''</p><p>But some professors and students say they have reservations about all the high-tech wizardry. Andrew Brandon, 22, a senior English and Spanish major at Vassar, said he was initially dismayed to find laser discs and the Internet in his Shakespeare class two years ago. ''When you go into a Shakespeare course, you have this image of yourself as a literate scholar going into the Gothic library,'' he said. Still, he added, ''the technology itself helped with the different film and theatrical versions. You didn't even have to pull a tape out of the VCR and rewind it.''</p><p>In recent years, liberal arts colleges, seeking to address technology concerns, have appointed professors and students to technology committees and created multidisciplinary classrooms to encourage collaboration among various departments, libraries and computer centers. Last summer, Vassar completed a $500,000 science laboratory outfitted with 20 high-speed personal computers that will be used to teach everything from animal behavior to physics. And a $200,000 multimedia area called the Media Cloisters will soon be opened in a section of the library.</p><p>Professor Joyce, a pioneer of the hypertext novel, said he envisioned the Media Cloisters as a gathering place for faculty members and students that would foster the kind of intellectual exchanges that took place in stone monasteries in earlier centuries. ''I'm not interested in these kids learning a particular technology like making a Web page,'' he said. ''I'm interested in them learning how we create a culture together.''</p><p>Yet such technological showplaces can be costly, and though their investments are steadily increasing, officials of small liberal arts colleges say they still typically spend only 4 percent of their operating budget on technology, while large research universities spend as much as 10 percent. To stretch their limited resources, a handful of colleges have started working together to adapt technologies to their common educational purposes.</p><p>Reed College, for instance, is coordinating a project with Vassar, Swarthmore and Occidental Colleges to explore and develop Web-based technologies for the campus. The project is being financed through a $1.2 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p><p>The 1,300 undergraduate students at Reed already use Web-based software that supplements traditional class instruction in subjects like history, philosophy and literature. One tutorial teaches an analysis of the rhythms of poetry. Another allows students to create original music without lifting an instrument, as one part of a course taught by a composer whose music has been performed at Carnegie Hall.</p><p>''This is very different from what you might find in distance education,'' said Martin Ringle, Reed's director of computing and information services. ''This is just another tool that contributes to the students' ability to do things out of class. But it's not a packaged class. Face-to-face contact is still considered a very important part of the education process.''</p><p>In Professor Joyce's hypertext class, students spend much of their time in front of computers, clicking individual words that open yet another dimension in a story or poem.</p><p>Professor Joyce, who arrived at Vassar in 1992, describes himself as an agent of change. He has watched with particular satisfaction as his hypertext classes have grown in popularity with students and faculty members. ''Most people thought it wouldn't last,'' he said. ''They thought it was a fad, but the Web changed everything.''</p><p>Photos: Prof. Michael Joyce's class at Vassar includes work with hypertext fiction, in which a click of a computer mouse can lead to a different ending or plot twist.
