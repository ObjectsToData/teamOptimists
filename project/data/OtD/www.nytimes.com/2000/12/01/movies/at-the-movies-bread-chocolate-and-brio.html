But the bronchitis did keep Mr. Manfredi in bed at the Pierre Hotel, where he was attended to by his wife, Erminia; his brother, Dante; his American distributor, Bruno Bossio; and a writer, whose attempts to ask a few questions were met with a loud chorus of competing voices in Italian, English and something in between.

                    <p>An attack of bronchitis didn't prevent Nino Manfredi, the Italian comic actor, from coming to Manhattan this week to accept an award from the Italian-American Chamber of Commerce and to attend the opening of ''Moon Shadow'' (''Colpo di Luna''), a film he made in 1995 that is just now reaching the United States.</p><p>But the bronchitis did keep Mr. Manfredi in bed at the Pierre Hotel, where he was attended to by his wife, Erminia; his brother, Dante; his American distributor, Bruno Bossio; and a writer, whose attempts to ask a few questions were met with a loud chorus of competing voices in Italian, English and something in between.</p><p>Mr. Manfredi, 79, is best known in the United States for his performance as a resourceful immigrant worker in Franco Brusati's 1973 ''Bread and Chocolate'' and as a wandering husband in the 1981 ''Portrait of a Woman, Nude,'' which he directed with Alberto Lattuada. But Mr. Manfredi and his family agreed that Italian audiences were most likely to identify him with ''Between Miracles,'' a 1971 film in which he directed himself as a young man raised in a convent whose religious convictions waver when he discovers sex. Ever since, Mr. Manfredi said, he has found himself cast as priests, even though he is a dedicated atheist.</p><p>His one brush with Hollywood occurred in 1972, when Billy Wilder offered him a role alongside Jack Lemmon in ''Avanti!'' But the director wanted him to play the part in English, which worried Mr. Manfredi. ''I told him I would act in English if Jack Lemmon would act in Italian.  He looked at me like I was crazy.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Moon Shadow,'' which opens today at the Cinema Village in Greenwich Village (review, Page 25), is the first and so far only feature by Alberto Simone, a psychologist who became interested in the democratic psychiatry movement founded in the 1970's by Franco Basaglia. The movement was driven by a leftist ideology that viewed asylums as prisons used by society to deprive people of their rights. In the movie  Mr. Manfredi plays a Sicilian carpenter whose son, a schizophrenic, is part of an open community for the mentally ill.</p><p>It is not a particularly comic role, but then Mr. Manfredi said he does not consider himself a comedian but a dramatic actor who knows how to make people laugh. ''One time my drama teacher asked me to perform Hamlet's soliloquy, and the whole class started laughing. He told me not to worry because I had the gift to criticize society with a smile.''</p><p>A Second Honeymoon</p><p>Leonard Kastle's ''Honeymoon Killers'' (1969), based on the 1947 crime spree of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez, is one of the most celebrated one-shots in American moviemaking. As its director and writer, Mr. Kastle, a composer by trade, never made another film,  despite glowing reviews and a cult reputation.</p><p>At least two alternative rock bands have named themselves after Mr. Kastle's movie, which relates, in stark black-and-white images, the fervent love affair between an overweight nurse (Shirley Stoler) and a failed gigolo (Tony Lo Bianco). They consummate their passion by murdering wealthy widows and absconding with their estates.</p><p>But now Mr. Kastle is ready to film again. With the help of Richard Prince, a painter and photographer who lives near him in upstate New York, Mr. Kastle is preparing to shoot ''Wedding at Cana,'' a story of sex and religion that promises to be as disturbing as his debut film.</p><p>''This is a script that I wrote right after 'Honeymoon Killers,' and it's about 10 times better,'' Mr. Kastle said during a recent visit to Manhattan. ''I want to do the whole thing the same way, with people who aren't known and in black and white, though maybe the miracle at the very end will be in color.''</p><p>Mr. Kastle's day job, until his recent retirement, was as a visiting professor of humanities and fine arts at the State University of New York at Albany, where he taught music while working on operas and orchestral pieces. His work has been performed by the New York Philharmonic.</p><p>He has also been the organist at a church in neighboring Rensselaerville, N.Y., where he met Mr. Prince at a lunch. ''The hostess said to him, 'Oh, Leonard's written a film,' '' Mr. Kastle recalled, ''and he looked slightly patronizing and asked me what it was called.'' It turned out that Mr. Prince owned two copies of ''The Honeymoon Killers,'' and a partnership was born.</p><p>''He's going to put up the money -- it won't cost much -- and we're going to see what we can do,'' said Mr. Kastle, who is scouring New York City for actors and a cinematographer who can give him what he wants. ''I can see this whole movie in my mind,'' he said, ''It will be good.''</p><p>Double-Barreled DVD's</p><p>Made in 1965, Monte Hellman's low-budget western ''The Shooting'' seemed to anticipate much of the stylistic innovations and ambitious themes of the American cinema of the 1970's -- work by the generation that included Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman. Among its stars was a young Jack Nicholson, who produced the film with his old friend Mr. Hellman. Its writer, using the pseudonym Adrien Joyce, was Carole Eastman, who wrote another picture for Mr. Nicholson a few years later, ''Five Easy Pieces.''</p><p>Shot back to back with another western, the more traditional but still distinctive ''Ride in the Whirlwind,'' ''The Shooting'' was sold straight to television by its original distributor, and has since circulated only in fuzzy, pirated copies. But both films are being released on DVD in beautifully restored prints by VCI Home Video, (800) 331-4077.</p><p>''The negative elements were in really bad shape,'' Mr. Hellman said by phone from Los Angeles, where he is preparing a new film. ''They fell apart a few times in the process of making the new prints. But now we have new ones, and they were used to make the DVD's.''</p><p>Mr. Hellman, whose subsequent work includes ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' and ''Cockfighter,'' met Mr. Nicholson on the set of a 1960 Roger Corman drive-in special called ''The Wild Ride.'' ''We just sort of hit it off and began talking about writing a script,'' he recalled. ''Later, Jack and I were off in the Philippines doing a couple of pictures, one of which Jack wrote.</p><p>''Before we left, we had a deal with Corman to do a script that we had worked on together, and when we came back, Corman had changed his mind. He said, 'I think that picture's too European and not commercial, but if you want to make a western, I'll give you the money for that.' By the time we'd finished lunch, he said, 'Well, as long as you're going to make one western, you might as well make two.' ''</p><p>Mr. Hellman, a stubbornly personal filmmaker who hasn't always had an easy time in Hollywood, almost sighs at the recollection. ''I wish it were like that today.''</p><p>Photo: The Italian actor Nino Manfredi is in ''Moon Shadow,'' opening today.
