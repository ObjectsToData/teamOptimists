The results of a new state math test had just come out, and only 39 percent of the eighth graders at his school in Brooklyn had met state standards.    Mr. Adams's students had done better than the abysmal citywide average of 23 percent. But in the surrounding middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge and Sunset Park, where parents are electricians, civil servants, jewelers and doctors, better than average was not good enough.

Fifty-seven percent of the students passed the test, a rise of 18 percentage points.</p>                </div>

                    <p>It was a gain so rare that in today's cynical education environment it was more likely to invite suspicions of cheating than congratulations.</p><p>But in a tour of his school this week, Mr. Adams provided a case study in how high-stakes testing -- often maligned as shallow, misdirected and irrelevant -- can drive improvements in education.</p><p>The trick, Mr. Adams said, was hard work, extra hours, small classes and teachers steeped in their subjects.</p><p>Over the last school year, dozens of the academically neediest students at I.S. 187 got not just more test preparation, but more hard-core education. Every child who scored in the bottom of four levels -- ''far below standards'' -- on state and city math tests was scheduled for double periods of math from September to June. Instead of the customary five periods of math a week, these children got 10, giving up electives like physical education, home economics and assembly.</p><p>Every day, in classes of just 10 to 12 students, they got a second chance to go over material they had struggled with in their regular classes of 33. Even children who passed the test were offered homework help, peer tutoring and test-taking strategy sessions before and after school and during lunch.</p><p>When the state math test was given again in June, 58 more children -- the equivalent of two full classes -- passed it this year than last.</p><p>This week, a new round of letters went home to parents, reflecting the latest round of test scores. Children who scored high enough to avoid double math periods, but still below standards, are once again being urged to attend after-school math and homework programs.</p><p>Mr. Adams acknowledged that having 57 percent meeting standards, though higher than the city average of 23 percent, still left a lot to be desired. So he is once again devoting time and money to children at the bottom.</p><p>The extra classes are paid for with I.S. 187's share of $30 million in ''ending social promotion'' money -- for programs to help promote struggling students legitimately into the next grades. Such funds were allocated to middle schools throughout the city by the Board of Education, for the second year in a row, but each of the city's 32 school districts is allowed to decide how to spend its allotment, which amounts to $121 for every sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade student citywide. Other schools used the money to lower class sizes, start new after-school programs and hire specialized teachers.</p><p>I.S. 187's decision to add math classes benefits children like Brittany Boccio, a diminutive girl with glasses and a riveting gaze, who was scared of math until she started attending double sessions last year. ''Thank heaven for Mrs. Mennella,'' Brittany said this week, praising her remedial math teacher, Grace Ann Mennella, a certified public accountant with a bachelor's degree in probability theory and statistics. ''I can't believe how much I improved.''</p><p>On Monday, Ms. Mennella reviewed prime numbers for Brittany and nine classmates. They had been introduced to the same material last Friday, in a regular math class, but their grasp of it was still shaky. Using stick figures, charts and a lively sense of humor, Ms. Mennella drew each child into an exploration of prime numbers. She ended the lesson with a mathematical game, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a grid that showed the pattern of prime numbers.</p><p>Most of these children, Ms. Mennella said later, can do the work. But they have fallen so far behind that they have lost faith in their own ability. And they are embarrassed to ask what might be perceived as stupid questions in front of children who understand the work. She sees her job as restoring their confidence.</p><p>Mr. Adams has instituted a similar regimen for children who were weak in English. The proportion of his eighth graders meeting state standards in English rose by 8 percentage points to 64 percent.</p><p>Asked about curriculum and textbooks -- among the issues that obsess education advocates and teaching colleges -- the teachers at I.S. 187 look bemused. They have not changed textbooks in six years, since I.S. 187, formally known as the Christa McAuliffe School, was founded in a shuttered elementary school at 1171 65th Street, as immigration, the thriving economy and the declining crime rate in the city swelled the ranks of children going to public school in the surrounding neighborhood of modest attached houses.</p>                </div>
