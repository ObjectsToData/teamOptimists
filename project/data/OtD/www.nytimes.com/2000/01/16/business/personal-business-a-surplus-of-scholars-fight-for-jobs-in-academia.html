                    <p>LIKE some other Ph.D.'s who attended the annual Modern Language Association conference last month in Chicago, April Overstreet, 31, is committed to pursuing a tenure-track job in academia.</p><p>''This is what I love to do, and I believe in the value of what I do,'' she said of her one-year post as a visiting assistant professor in the Spanish and Portuguese department of the University of Iowa. ''Not a lot of people can say that.''</p><p>Scholars like Ms. Overstreet need to believe in their work, because in one of the hottest employment markets in decades, finding a humanities job in academia remains one of the toughest assignments around. With universities continuing to rely on part-time faculty in their English and foreign-language departments, there is a short supply of jobs that lead to tenured positions.</p><p>Ms. Overstreet, who is fluent in Spanish and proficient in French and Portuguese, is the very portrait of commitment to her field. She knew as an undergraduate that she wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in Spanish, so after graduation she traveled to Spain for two years, supporting herself by teaching English and living in rural areas where she could perfect her language skills and absorb the culture.</p>                </div>

                    <p>She then spent five and a half years earning her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, where she worked about 30 hours a week as a graduate student instructor in return for free tuition and enough money to cover her living costs. When she wasn't teaching, she worked on her dissertation --  a study of picaresque themes in four Spanish novels.</p><p>Despite all that training, Ms. Overstreet did not get a tenure-track offer from an institution she would consider joining. Instead, she found a good but temporary teaching position at Iowa, a job that pays  $30,000. But because she remains in the job market, she must also further her research  and keep filling out applications.</p><p>As new Ph.D.'s flock to the annual language association convention for interviews, they compete not only with fellow graduates but also with those from previous years who have failed to land tenure-track posts. Doctoral candidates spend as many as 10 years completing their degrees, so it is difficult for them to predict what the job picture will be like when they graduate.</p><p>Throughout the 1990's, more than twice as many Ph.D's were granted in these fields as there were tenure-track openings. In 1998, according to the language association, 1,718 Ph.D.'s were granted in English and foreign languages, but there were only 721 tenure-track jobs.</p><p>In such a competitive market, it is not uncommon for a Ph.D. in English or a foreign language to spend several years as a visiting professor or part-time faculty member, though some research concludes that after three years of that lifestyle, many Ph.D.'s lose their morale or their marketability. As the market remains tight, the academics themselves have stepped up the debate about how to handle the problem.</p><p>''It's fair to say that in our community, there are two distinct points of view,'' says Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the language association. While some academics still say doctorates are meant only to prepare college teachers, a growing number say the degrees can be used in many other fields that require the ability to write, research and teach.</p><p>MAGGIE DEBELIUS and Sue Basalla, English Ph.D. candidates at Princeton, decided against full-time jobs in academia. But then they had to translate their skills for use in the wider world. While the occasional public relations firm, nonprofit group or government agency will seek a Ph.D. by advertising in the association's job listings, Ph.D.'s who plan to look outside academia usually need to take on their own career searches.</p><p>To provide guidance, Ms. Debelius and Ms. Basalla have written a book scheduled to be published this fall called, ''What Are You Going to Do With That?'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux). Ph.D.'s are often unaware of the breadth of options beyond academia, they said. ''We were talking about how sad it was to see our friends from Princeton taking bad jobs or a succession of one-years,'' Ms. Debelius said of the book's genesis. ''It seemed such a waste of human potential.''</p><p>Ms. Basalla, a professor's daughter, said she decided in the mid-90's that she did not want to teach after she received her graduate degree. Her parents agreed to support her for a year, relieving her of her part-time teaching duties, so she could complete the degree in 1997. After a year of job experimentation -- including an office position at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, focused on health care -- she became a medical and health care journalist in Washington at FDC Reports, a magazine.</p><p>Ms. Debelius, who expects to finish her dissertation this year, teaches part time at Georgetown University and works part time for a Web start-up called Lifeminders.com, which publishes e-mail newsletters. At Lifeminders, she realized that she liked spending part of her time outside academia. Now she plans to continue this double work life.</p><p>For those looking for jobs, the language association offers a two-day course at its annual convention, taught by a job search expert, Howard Figler. Other organizations also offer help to Ph.D's looking for work. The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J., has enlisted companies ranging from Microsoft to McKinsey, as well as private schools, to consider Ph.D.'s for jobs with salaries in the $30,000 to $60,000 range. The Wilson Foundation tries to match job candidates and companies.</p><p>The foundation also gives grants to schools that foster work experience outside academia for Ph.D's. The University of Massachusetts at Amherst, for instance, is using a grant to pay graduate students in English who serve as interns at local publishers and other companies.</p><p>For scholars who are committed to a traditional academic career, learning to cope with the prolonged uncertainty of part-time or visiting professorships seems, for now, to be just another part of the job. Though a wave of university retirements is likely in the next five years, it does not mean that much will change in the short term. ''It's the next stage of investment I have to put in,'' Ms. Overstreet said of her first year on the visiting professor circuit. ''Being in academia is like being an artist. If you can possibly do anything else, you should.''</p><p>Photo: Amid an oversupply of language Ph.D.'s, April Overstreet, whose degree is in Spanish, got a one-year post at the University of Iowa.
