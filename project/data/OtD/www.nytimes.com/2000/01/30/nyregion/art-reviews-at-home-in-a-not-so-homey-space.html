With newly renovated galleries, the arts council's 19th-century building is now a much more sympathetic environment for contemporary art. Gone are some of the architectural details, like windows, moldings and fireplaces, that defined the building's original domestic character and made hanging a coherent show almost impossible. Thanks to the remodeling, period charm is nicely balanced with neutral display space.    In this hospitable setting, works by 80 of the arts council's members have adequate, if not ample, space. Fortunately, many of the pieces are small, and some of the smallest are among the show's most engaging entries. ''The Last Apple,'' Daniel Charzuk's tiny glass sculpture, for example, has all the fascination of a carefully nurtured bonsai threatened by the prospect of impending death. The solitary fruit that clings to a withered and twisted branch symbolizes hope or despair, depending on your point of view.  ">

Gone are some of the architectural details, like windows, moldings and fireplaces, that defined the building's original domestic character and made hanging a coherent show almost impossible.

Fortunately, many of the pieces are small, and some of the smallest are among the show's most engaging entries. ''The Last Apple,'' Daniel Charzuk's tiny glass sculpture, for example, has all the fascination of a carefully nurtured bonsai threatened by the prospect of impending death.

Gone are some of the architectural details, like windows, moldings and fireplaces, that defined the building's original domestic character and made hanging a coherent show almost impossible. Thanks to the remodeling, period charm is nicely balanced with neutral display space.</p><p>In this hospitable setting, works by 80 of the arts council's members have adequate, if not ample, space. Fortunately, many of the pieces are small, and some of the smallest are among the show's most engaging entries. ''The Last Apple,'' Daniel Charzuk's tiny glass sculpture, for example, has all the fascination of a carefully nurtured bonsai threatened by the prospect of impending death. The solitary fruit that clings to a withered and twisted branch symbolizes hope or despair, depending on your point of view.</p><p>On a less ambiguous note, Mary R. Harte's untitled photographic transfer print expresses in visual terms the fragrance of flowers borne on the breeze. By floating the image-bearing emulsion onto paper, Ms. Harte makes the blossoms seem to drift in space, like gossamer fabric infused with floral essence. Using an old-fashioned schoolroom slate as a backing, an artist known only as Garance offers a charmingly simplified version of a bluebird, as if a child had been asked to write its name but chose instead to picture it.</p><p>Several larger works are worthy of note, including Gustavo Souto's pastel, ''I Love You More Than You Love Me.'' As a variation on Rene Magritte's theme of oversize fruit crammed into claustrophobic rooms, it sets up an edgy dialogue between two pears, with stems that seem to be simultaneously caressing and sparring with one another. The drama of a reflected sunset creates a stark contrast in ''Electric Sky,'' Robert Mehling's oil of a tranquil landscape animated by vivid atmosphere. And in ''Fishing Boat at Peterson's Marina, Mattituck,'' Vincent Torre's strong, solid forms and low-key colors recall Marsden Hartley's treatment of similar maritime subjects.</p><p>''Abstractions''</p><p>Gallery North, 90 North Country</p><p>Road, Setauket. Through Feb. 27.</p><p>(631) 751-2676.</p><p>The term abstraction has become a catchall for nonrepresentational art, but it literally means extracting the essence of a given subject. Thus, much abstract art contains recognizable references to things from which it derives. But abstraction has also come to mean something completely divorced from an external starting point -- what purists would call nonobjective art. Both aspects of abstraction are illustrated by the work of the five artists in this handsome and varied show.</p><p>Nola Zirin, Emily Mason and Anne Raymond use natural phenomena as points of departure, sometimes overtly and sometimes indirectly. In Ms. Zirin's two ''Phases'' paintings, for example, the moon's waxing and waning is suggested by sequences of luminous shapes veiled in overpainting that recalls an overcast sky. ''Oil Slick,'' on the other hand, is not so much a portrait of a stain spreading over water as a meditation on the medium of paint itself and its interaction with wax. Even more directly, ''Luminosity'' is about nothing but the phenomenon described by its title.</p><p>Both Ms. Mason and Ms. Raymond are concerned with emotional responses to their experiences, or what one might term visual equivalents for intangible feelings. Ms. Raymond's ''Morro Bay II'' and ''Oval Office'' are, in a sense, souvenirs of specific places, but neither painting describes anything concrete about those locales. Instead, the artist pictures a mood or an aura -- what it was like to be there, rather than what the surroundings looked like. In Ms. Mason's high-key paintings and prints, visual cues are more keyed to landscape elements, but the scenery is nevertheless subjective and emotionally derived.</p><p>Darlene Charneco bases her imagery on coded writing, a common enough form of abstraction, but one that defies straightforward interpretation. Her alphabet is made of nails driven into panels and bent over their surfaces, forming raised patterns that are at once cryptic and heavy with latent meaning. Seven panels from ''The Book of Questions,'' with their maddeningly obscure texts, recall Gertrude Stein's famous last words. When asked, on her deathbed, ''What is the answer?'' Stein purportedly said, ''What is the question?''</p><p>Esteban Vicente has traveled the furthest from exterior references in his free-floating chromatic abstractions, which work best when colors and gestures coalesce in a kind of interactive balance, like a living organism with all its interdependent parts working in rhythmic harmony. Yet, in spite of a viewer's tendency to read foliage and earth into the greens and ochers of ''Discovery,'' or to imagine dazzling sunlight bleaching the lime and lemon accents of ''Composition,'' the real analogy of Mr. Vicente's visual art is music, the most abstract of the arts.</p><p>Juried Photography Show</p><p>Smithtown Township Arts Council,</p><p>Mills Pond House, 660 Route 25A, St.</p><p>James. Through Feb. 27. (631) 862-</p><p>6575.</p><p>An unusual number of the photographs in this show seem to have echoes -- two tulip still lifes, two studies of eggs, two closeups of antique engines, and prints made of mirror-image or repeat components. Perhaps those reflections themselves reflect the taste of the show's juror, Kevin Watroba, a photography specialist for earthgroup.com, an online art sales firm. Whatever the reason, they give the show an interesting twist.</p><p>One of the flower pictures, Karen Dombrovski-Sobel's ''Parrot Tulips,'' won the award of excellence. It is an exceptionally sensuous treatment that eschews color to concentrate on texture, light and form. The slightly overblown blossoms, highlighted against a velvety black background, seem to glow with an inner radiance. Ms. Dombrovski-Sobel's other two entries handle light quite differently, but are equally accomplished. Her mysterious ''White of Eye, Moving,'' uses a slow shutter speed to draw with light directly on film, while ''Dog on Beach'' is a study of forms defined by natural illumination.</p><p>In Thomas Torquist's ''Staircase'' and Howard Kreidter's ''Snow Fence,'' reversal creates symmetrical halves of compound prints in which familiar shapes become abstract patterns. John Michaels takes the process one step further in his honorable mention award winner, ''Congruent Crates,'' a four-part amalgam that turns the wood slats of packing cases into Constructivist geometry. And in ''Galactica,'' three different views of a basketball hoop stanchion, a photographer identified as Rain Skye transforms a humble piece of sports equipment into an unidentified flying object.</p><p>Repetition is not the show's only outstanding feature, however.</p><p>There are many notable images without duplicate parts, including Ken Hubbard's ''Lindenhurst,'' with its dramatic shadows and odd feeling of suspended animation, Antonia Pisciotta's two-color landscapes that focus on lovingly scrutinized rhythms and textures, and Jim Senetto's pair of untitled montages, in which building fragments and water details are disturbingly off-kilter and out of scale.</p><p>Photos: A bluebird, left, by Garance uses an old-fashioned slate as a background; ''Parrot Tulips,'' above, by Karen Dombrovski-Sobel, which won an award of excellence at the East End Arts and Humanities Council, and ''Oval Office,'' left, by Anne Raymond in the ''Abstractions'' show.</p>                </div>
