    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" INTERNATIONAL   A3-12    Middle East Summit Ends Without a Settlement  President Clinton said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Camp David had been unable to reach an agreement after two weeks of talks on such issues as the shape of a new Palestinian state and the future Palestinian refugees. The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat who had balked, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, which Israelis and Palestinians both claim as their sacred capital.   A1    Mr. Barak flew home to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters and his country sharply divided over the startling new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control.   A12    Analysts said Mr. Arafat's refusal to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem allowed him to return home with his credibility intact among other Arab and Muslim leaders.   A11    Supersonic Airliner Crashes  A chartered Air France Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for New York crashed shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, killing all 109 passengers and crew members and at least 4 people on the ground. It was the first crash of a Concorde.   A1    North Korean to Visit Russia  Russian officials said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would visit Russia in September, a further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome its isolation.   A3    New View of Nazi-Era Mystery  A Swedish official said Russia had stopped taking the position that Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved many European Jews during the Holocaust, died a natural death while in Soviet hands.   A3    NATO and Missile Defense  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the proposed missile defense system could not succeed unless the United States persuaded its NATO allies to drop their opposition. Many of the allies have expressed concern that the plan could upset the nuclear balance or set off an arms race.   A3    World Briefing   A6    NATIONAL   A14-20    Bush Names Cheney As G.O.P. Running Mate  Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and a longtime family friend, as his choice for vice president, praising Mr. Cheney, 59, as a man of ''great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''   A1    Mr. Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative voting records during 10 years as a Republican congressman from Wyoming.   A19    The Gore camp expressed relief at Mr. Cheney's selection and, citing his Congressional record, quickly sought to portray him as far outside the mainstream.   A20    While Mr. Cheney handled the screening of the other prospects for the ticket, Mr. Bush himself conducted the interview of Mr. Cheney about his finances and personal life.   A18    Mr. Cheney's doctors said he takes many medications for heart disease and other conditions but that he is in excellent health.   A19    Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne V. Cheney, 58, a former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has a reputation as a passionate opponent of ''political correctness'' and a record even more conservative than her husband's.   A20    The State of Black America  The National Urban League said in its annual overview on the state of black America that home ownership among blacks was at a record high and unemployment was reaching a record low. But the report also noted that blacks represented a disproportionately high number of adults and juveniles in prison and of those dying of cancer, AIDS and other diseases. It also said that black men trailed black women in educational success and that the gap was widening.   A16    EDUCATION   B10    Study on Why Pupils Excel  A national study said that smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool appear to increase student achievement, particularly in poor communities, more than the salaries, education or experience of teachers. The study also called for increased federal spending to reduce disparities among states.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    Effects of Pesticide Sprays Are Hard to Measure  Environmentalists have raised concerns that the region's fragile ecosystem may be damaged by pesticide spraying to fight the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. But even critics of the spraying concede that there has been little conclusive evidence to back up their fears.   B1    After blanketing Central Park, Staten Island and parts of Queens with pesticide in a stepped-up campaign to knock out the West Nile virus, city officials were preparing to spray Roosevelt Island and a large section of Manhattan tonight.   B4    Concrete Attack Suspect Freed  Bently Louis Grant, a homeless man who had been accused of smashing Tiffany F. Goldberg on the head with a chunk of concrete on July 9 in Midtown, was ordered released after prosecutors said that new evidence might exonerate him. Security videotapes taken from a Virgin Records store at Union Square may provide Mr. Grant with an alibi, showing that he was at the store when the attack took place.   B1    Roofing Industry Indictments  Some of New York City's biggest roofing contractors routinely used nonunion labor even though their contracts for large public-works projects forbade that, prosecutors said in announcing indictments of 13 people and 5 companies.   B6    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Arrival at Space Station  A long-awaited Russian component docked with the International Space Station 230 miles above Kazakhstan, marking what planners hoped would be a resurgence in the construction of the orbital outpost.   A7    ARTS   E1-10    OBITUARIES   B9    Joseph F. Enright  The captain of the submarine Archerfish, which sank the largest aircraft carrier of World War II, the converted Japanese battleship Shinano, was 89.   B9    BUSINESS DAY   C1-20    New Data to Influence Rates  Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge on economic data released in coming weeks. He said higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, but he warned investors not to assume that the policy committee would make no changes when it meets on Aug. 22.   C1    New Ad Planner for G.M.  General Motors consolidated responsibilities for deciding where to run its ads at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the B Com3   Group. The assignment, the largest in the history of Madison Avenue, involves an annual budget of $2.9 billion. The decision affects all G.M. brands sold in the United States except Saab and Saturn.   C1    Kmart to Close Stores  Kmart said it would take a $740 million pretax charge for inventory clearance and store closings and said investment in technology would be critical to growth. The company is closing 72 stores, and about 5,000 jobs will be eliminated.

	data-description=" INTERNATIONAL   A3-12    Middle East Summit Ends Without a Settlement  President Clinton said Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Camp David had been unable to reach an agreement after two weeks of talks on such issues as the shape of a new Palestinian state and the future Palestinian refugees. The president and other American mediators made clear that it was Yasir Arafat who had balked, and by all accounts the issue was Jerusalem, which Israelis and Palestinians both claim as their sacred capital.   A1    Mr. Barak flew home to a murky political future, his patchwork coalition in tatters and his country sharply divided over the startling new discussion of ceding parts of Jerusalem to some form of Palestinian control.   A12    Analysts said Mr. Arafat's refusal to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem allowed him to return home with his credibility intact among other Arab and Muslim leaders.   A11    Supersonic Airliner Crashes  A chartered Air France Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for New York crashed shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, killing all 109 passengers and crew members and at least 4 people on the ground. It was the first crash of a Concorde.   A1    North Korean to Visit Russia  Russian officials said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would visit Russia in September, a further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome its isolation.   A3    New View of Nazi-Era Mystery  A Swedish official said Russia had stopped taking the position that Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved many European Jews during the Holocaust, died a natural death while in Soviet hands.   A3    NATO and Missile Defense  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the proposed missile defense system could not succeed unless the United States persuaded its NATO allies to drop their opposition. Many of the allies have expressed concern that the plan could upset the nuclear balance or set off an arms race.   A3    World Briefing   A6    NATIONAL   A14-20    Bush Names Cheney As G.O.P. Running Mate  Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and a longtime family friend, as his choice for vice president, praising Mr. Cheney, 59, as a man of ''great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''   A1    Mr. Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative voting records during 10 years as a Republican congressman from Wyoming.   A19    The Gore camp expressed relief at Mr. Cheney's selection and, citing his Congressional record, quickly sought to portray him as far outside the mainstream.   A20    While Mr. Cheney handled the screening of the other prospects for the ticket, Mr. Bush himself conducted the interview of Mr. Cheney about his finances and personal life.   A18    Mr. Cheney's doctors said he takes many medications for heart disease and other conditions but that he is in excellent health.   A19    Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne V. Cheney, 58, a former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has a reputation as a passionate opponent of ''political correctness'' and a record even more conservative than her husband's.   A20    The State of Black America  The National Urban League said in its annual overview on the state of black America that home ownership among blacks was at a record high and unemployment was reaching a record low. But the report also noted that blacks represented a disproportionately high number of adults and juveniles in prison and of those dying of cancer, AIDS and other diseases. It also said that black men trailed black women in educational success and that the gap was widening.   A16    EDUCATION   B10    Study on Why Pupils Excel  A national study said that smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool appear to increase student achievement, particularly in poor communities, more than the salaries, education or experience of teachers. The study also called for increased federal spending to reduce disparities among states.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    Effects of Pesticide Sprays Are Hard to Measure  Environmentalists have raised concerns that the region's fragile ecosystem may be damaged by pesticide spraying to fight the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. But even critics of the spraying concede that there has been little conclusive evidence to back up their fears.   B1    After blanketing Central Park, Staten Island and parts of Queens with pesticide in a stepped-up campaign to knock out the West Nile virus, city officials were preparing to spray Roosevelt Island and a large section of Manhattan tonight.   B4    Concrete Attack Suspect Freed  Bently Louis Grant, a homeless man who had been accused of smashing Tiffany F. Goldberg on the head with a chunk of concrete on July 9 in Midtown, was ordered released after prosecutors said that new evidence might exonerate him. Security videotapes taken from a Virgin Records store at Union Square may provide Mr. Grant with an alibi, showing that he was at the store when the attack took place.   B1    Roofing Industry Indictments  Some of New York City's biggest roofing contractors routinely used nonunion labor even though their contracts for large public-works projects forbade that, prosecutors said in announcing indictments of 13 people and 5 companies.   B6    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Arrival at Space Station  A long-awaited Russian component docked with the International Space Station 230 miles above Kazakhstan, marking what planners hoped would be a resurgence in the construction of the orbital outpost.   A7    ARTS   E1-10    OBITUARIES   B9    Joseph F. Enright  The captain of the submarine Archerfish, which sank the largest aircraft carrier of World War II, the converted Japanese battleship Shinano, was 89.   B9    BUSINESS DAY   C1-20    New Data to Influence Rates  Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge on economic data released in coming weeks. He said higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, but he warned investors not to assume that the policy committee would make no changes when it meets on Aug. 22.   C1    New Ad Planner for G.M.  General Motors consolidated responsibilities for deciding where to run its ads at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the B Com3   Group. The assignment, the largest in the history of Madison Avenue, involves an annual budget of $2.9 billion. The decision affects all G.M. brands sold in the United States except Saab and Saturn.   C1    Kmart to Close Stores  Kmart said it would take a $740 million pretax charge for inventory clearance and store closings and said investment in technology would be critical to growth. The company is closing 72 stores, and about 5,000 jobs will be eliminated.

                    <p>Analysts said Mr. Arafat's refusal to negotiate away his claims to Jerusalem allowed him to return home with his credibility intact among other Arab and Muslim leaders.   A11</p><p>Supersonic Airliner Crashes</p><p>A chartered Air France Concorde carrying mainly German tourists bound for New York crashed shortly after takeoff from Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, killing all 109 passengers and crew members and at least 4 people on the ground. It was the first crash of a Concorde.   A1</p><p>North Korean to Visit Russia</p><p>Russian officials said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would visit Russia in September, a further step by the once-secretive North Korean state to overcome its isolation.   A3</p><p>New View of Nazi-Era Mystery</p><p>A Swedish official said Russia had stopped taking the position that Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved many European Jews during the Holocaust, died a natural death while in Soviet hands.   A3</p><p>NATO and Missile Defense</p><p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said the proposed missile defense system could not succeed unless the United States persuaded its NATO allies to drop their opposition. Many of the allies have expressed concern that the plan could upset the nuclear balance or set off an arms race.   A3</p><p>World Briefing   A6</p><p>NATIONAL   A14-20</p><p>Bush Names Cheney As G.O.P. Running Mate</p><p>Gov. George W. Bush formally introduced Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and a longtime family friend, as his choice for vice president, praising Mr. Cheney, 59, as a man of ''great integrity, sound judgment and experience.''   A1</p><p>Mr. Cheney had one of the most consistently conservative voting records during 10 years as a Republican congressman from Wyoming.   A19</p><p>The Gore camp expressed relief at Mr. Cheney's selection and, citing his Congressional record, quickly sought to portray him as far outside the mainstream.   A20</p><p>While Mr. Cheney handled the screening of the other prospects for the ticket, Mr. Bush himself conducted the interview of Mr. Cheney about his finances and personal life.   A18</p><p>Mr. Cheney's doctors said he takes many medications for heart disease and other conditions but that he is in excellent health.   A19</p><p>Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne V. Cheney, 58, a former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has a reputation as a passionate opponent of ''political correctness'' and a record even more conservative than her husband's.   A20</p><p>The State of Black America</p><p>The National Urban League said in its annual overview on the state of black America that home ownership among blacks was at a record high and unemployment was reaching a record low. But the report also noted that blacks represented a disproportionately high number of adults and juveniles in prison and of those dying of cancer, AIDS and other diseases. It also said that black men trailed black women in educational success and that the gap was widening.   A16</p><p>EDUCATION   B10</p><p>Study on Why Pupils Excel</p><p>A national study said that smaller class size in early grades and access to preschool appear to increase student achievement, particularly in poor communities, more than the salaries, education or experience of teachers. The study also called for increased federal spending to reduce disparities among states.   A14</p><p>NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10</p><p>Effects of Pesticide Sprays Are Hard to Measure</p><p>Environmentalists have raised concerns that the region's fragile ecosystem may be damaged by pesticide spraying to fight the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. But even critics of the spraying concede that there has been little conclusive evidence to back up their fears.   B1</p><p>After blanketing Central Park, Staten Island and parts of Queens with pesticide in a stepped-up campaign to knock out the West Nile virus, city officials were preparing to spray Roosevelt Island and a large section of Manhattan tonight.   B4</p><p>Concrete Attack Suspect Freed</p><p>Bently Louis Grant, a homeless man who had been accused of smashing Tiffany F. Goldberg on the head with a chunk of concrete on July 9 in Midtown, was ordered released after prosecutors said that new evidence might exonerate him. Security videotapes taken from a Virgin Records store at Union Square may provide Mr. Grant with an alibi, showing that he was at the store when the attack took place.   B1</p><p>Roofing Industry Indictments</p><p>Some of New York City's biggest roofing contractors routinely used nonunion labor even though their contracts for large public-works projects forbade that, prosecutors said in announcing indictments of 13 people and 5 companies.

Enright</p><p>The captain of the submarine Archerfish, which sank the largest aircraft carrier of World War II, the converted Japanese battleship Shinano, was 89.   B9</p><p>BUSINESS DAY   C1-20</p><p>New Data to Influence Rates</p><p>Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank's decision about whether to raise interest rates again at its meeting next month would hinge on economic data released in coming weeks. He said higher rates were starting to slow the economy and reduce the risk of inflation, but he warned investors not to assume that the policy committee would make no changes when it meets on Aug. 22.   C1</p><p>New Ad Planner for G.M.</p><p>General Motors consolidated responsibilities for deciding where to run its ads at a new shop to be formed by a unit of the B Com3   Group. The assignment, the largest in the history of Madison Avenue, involves an annual budget of $2.9 billion. The decision affects all G.M. brands sold in the United States except Saab and Saturn.   C1</p><p>Kmart to Close Stores</p><p>Kmart said it would take a $740 million pretax charge for inventory clearance and store closings and said investment in technology would be critical to growth.
