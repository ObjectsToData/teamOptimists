    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Two years ago, a few days before Thanksgiving, Mark Taylor, a faculty member at Williams College, in northwestern Massachusetts, received a phone call from Herbert Allen Jr. Taylor is a professor of humanities, a designation Williams invented for him; his sphere of expertise encompasses religion, philosophy, architecture theory and a couple of other disciplines. Allen is the investment banker and plutocrat famous for the retreat of bankers and plutocrats he hosts each summer in Sun Valley, Idaho. Both men had been members of the Williams community for a quarter-century or so -- Allen is a prominent alumnus and donor -- and they have houses about a mile apart in the thickly forested Berkshire hills in which the college is nestled, but they had never met; nor was it easy to imagine that they would have anything to say to each other. Taylor was one of those protean figures who vex campus life -- a perverse and provocative thinker, a guru and a troublemaker. He was flirting with an attractive offer from the University of North Carolina, and a former Williams administrator had recruited Allen to see if he could do something about it. Allen invited Taylor over for coffee.     As Taylor recalls it, Allen, a figure for whom ''bottom line'' is not a figure of speech, said, ''What are you doing, what aren't you doing that you'd like to be doing and where is the world heading?'' Taylor talked, as is his wont, about Hegel and Kierkegaard and Marx, about religion and philosophy and art and economics. He argued that, thanks largely to the Internet, a new ''network society'' was emerging in which knowledge would be the most precious of resources, that institutions and individuals would be drawn together in a global information marketplace and that the walls that separated the university from the larger world would be pierced. ''Usually, when I would describe to people where I think the world is heading,'' Taylor told me recently, ''the answer would be, 'Not in your lifetime or mine.' ''And Allen, in any case, says that he was the kind of college student who would have skipped the sort of classes Mark Taylor teaches. But while Allen had no use for Kierkegaard, he understood marketplaces, and he believed in the transformative powers of the Internet. He said, ''The world you're describing is the world I live in.'' And so, as one of Taylor's Williams colleagues puts it, ''he put his money where Mark's mouth is.'' He invited Taylor to draw up a plan to join the network society.  ">

	data-description="Two years ago, a few days before Thanksgiving, Mark Taylor, a faculty member at Williams College, in northwestern Massachusetts, received a phone call from Herbert Allen Jr. Taylor is a professor of humanities, a designation Williams invented for him; his sphere of expertise encompasses religion, philosophy, architecture theory and a couple of other disciplines. Allen is the investment banker and plutocrat famous for the retreat of bankers and plutocrats he hosts each summer in Sun Valley, Idaho. Both men had been members of the Williams community for a quarter-century or so -- Allen is a prominent alumnus and donor -- and they have houses about a mile apart in the thickly forested Berkshire hills in which the college is nestled, but they had never met; nor was it easy to imagine that they would have anything to say to each other. Taylor was one of those protean figures who vex campus life -- a perverse and provocative thinker, a guru and a troublemaker. He was flirting with an attractive offer from the University of North Carolina, and a former Williams administrator had recruited Allen to see if he could do something about it. Allen invited Taylor over for coffee.     As Taylor recalls it, Allen, a figure for whom ''bottom line'' is not a figure of speech, said, ''What are you doing, what aren't you doing that you'd like to be doing and where is the world heading?'' Taylor talked, as is his wont, about Hegel and Kierkegaard and Marx, about religion and philosophy and art and economics. He argued that, thanks largely to the Internet, a new ''network society'' was emerging in which knowledge would be the most precious of resources, that institutions and individuals would be drawn together in a global information marketplace and that the walls that separated the university from the larger world would be pierced. ''Usually, when I would describe to people where I think the world is heading,'' Taylor told me recently, ''the answer would be, 'Not in your lifetime or mine.' ''And Allen, in any case, says that he was the kind of college student who would have skipped the sort of classes Mark Taylor teaches. But while Allen had no use for Kierkegaard, he understood marketplaces, and he believed in the transformative powers of the Internet. He said, ''The world you're describing is the world I live in.'' And so, as one of Taylor's Williams colleagues puts it, ''he put his money where Mark's mouth is.'' He invited Taylor to draw up a plan to join the network society.  "></div>

And so, as one of Taylor's Williams colleagues puts it, ''he put his money where Mark's mouth is.'' He invited Taylor to draw up a plan to join the network society.</p><p>Now, many months of Taylor's blue-skying and many millions of Herbert Allen's dollars later, the fruit of that conversation is about to become available for public consumption. Beginning in February, the Global Education Network, a private, for-profit company owned by Allen, will be selling four or five college courses over the Internet. (The company plans to offer 25 courses by next September.) For now, these courses are being aimed principally at the ''lifelong learner'' market, but both Allen and Taylor talk about ultimately transforming higher education itself. Mary Lefkowitz, a classics scholar at Wellesley, will be offering her class on Greek mythology; professors at Brown, Duke, Williams and other colleges and universities will be teaching courses on Bocaccio's ''Decameron,'' on Alexander the Great, on the literature of Barcelona, on AIDS and on biology. Allen and other investors have already committed $20 million to the project and is likely to run through many more millions within a few years.</p><p>You'd probably have to go back to space travel to find an innovation that has abetted millennial fantasies as much as the Internet has; we live in an age of technological utopianism. Nevertheless, it's perfectly possible that if GEN doesn't bring about the revolution its founders have in mind, one or more of its competitors will. Online learning is already a $2 billion business; Gerald Odening, an analyst with Chase Bank, predicts that the figure will rise by 35 percent a year, reaching $9 billion by 2005. There are already online law schools and business schools and Ph.D. programs, as well as thousands of individual courses.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Online education has the force of inevitability. But is it good? It would, of course, be a fine thing if thousands of people could take Mary Lefkowitz's course on mythology; and perhaps it would also be a fine thing if classics departments started making enough money that they could afford to keep teaching classes that only six people care about, as Mark Taylor believes they will. But what about those walls, which among other things provide a little bit of protection from the all-devouring marketplace? As Charles Nesson, a professor at Harvard Law School who has given a lot of thought to the Internet, asks: ''What happens if you convert the university into a production house for making knowledge products? The university starts to look less like a community of scholars and much more like a drug company that has work-for-hire knowledge workers producing proprietary research.'' Who will bother to come to the university's defense once it starts behaving like every other institution in the culture? The Internet constitutes a much more profound challenge to the university than do, say, rising tuition costs or affirmative-action programs or speech codes -- because its promise and its threat are one and the same.</p>                </div>
