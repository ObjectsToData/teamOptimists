                    <p>There should be a sign on Howard Gotlieb's desk that reads: Flattery will get you everywhere.</p><p>But there is not, mainly because his desk and office are too crammed with Oscars, Emmys and Tonys to fit even a stray scrap of paper. They are not his awards, but those of Rex Harrison, Dan Rather, Myrna Loy and others. As curator of special collections at Boston University, Dr. Gotlieb has made a career out of cajoling the talented and famous to donate their manuscripts, letters, diaries and the occasional Academy Award to his vaults.</p><p>How convincing is he? Housed in seven miles of shelves within the university's Mugar Library are Groucho Marx's jokes, George Bernard Shaw's correspondence, Ella Fitzgerald's sheet music, and collections from nearly 1,800 other personalities of the last 100 years. These diverse treasures are on view in the library in small selections in rotating exhibits. Serious researchers willing to wear white gloves may get a look at the rest of the archives.</p><p>Some other major collections related to popular culture reside at the University of California at Los Angeles, Stanford University and the University of Texas. But if Boston University's archives is not the country's largest, it certainly owes the most to one man's instincts. When Dr. Gotlieb came here in 1963 from a curatorship at Yale, Boston University owned only a smattering of rare books and papers from a few dead luminaries, and there was no budget to purchase others.</p>                </div>

                    <p>So he made a list of 50 people he thought might someday be worthy of his collection, and he asked them to donate, not sell, their personal papers.</p><p>Such collecting was almost unheard of. ''It just was not the thing to do,'' said Dr. Gotlieb, 74. ''There was this strange feeling that only death and the patina of time could assure that you were worth being collected.''</p><p>''People were very suspicious in the beginning,'' he said. But his method -- ask early and often -- paid off. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had not yet made his march on Selma, Ala., when Dr. Gotlieb cornered him. James Clavell had only just published his first novel.</p><p>Dan Rather was a 32-year-old reporter covering the White House when Dr. Gotlieb turned up, unannounced, at the CBS news bureau in 1964. He had never heard of Dr. Gotlieb, or the archive at Boston University. As for papers, ''I don't have any,'' Mr. Rather remembers saying.</p><p>But the curator soon instructed him on the art of cardboard boxing. From then on, Mr. Rather said, ''When I didn't know what to do with something I would say, 'Send it to Boston.' ''</p><p>Mr. Rather said that he paid little attention to the papers he generated in his career and that he thought he had sent ''pretty thin gruel'' over the last 36 years, until he came to Boston last month to unveil an exhibition drawn from his collection. Among the notebooks and photographs, he was stunned to see the fatigues he wore in Vietnam. ''I had no idea they had some of this stuff,'' he said.</p><p>After Dr. Gotlieb asks for a collection, he asks again. And he sends gifts, like flowers for Joan Fontaine's hedges and even a bed for James Mason. He is an unabashed advocate of those whose items he collects, sending letters of protest to critics who give his writers or performers negative reviews. A prolific letter writer, Dr. Gotlieb has an active correspondence list of 2,500 to 3,000. He is respectfully dogged in his courtships.</p><p>''Ms. Davis took me 10 years,'' he said, of Bette Davis when asked about his hardest won prize. ''She would look me over, and then she would send people to look me over, and they would report to her. Then she would summon me to her home in Westport or her home in West Hollywood and look me over there. And this went on, back and forth, back and forth.</p><p>''She finally called one day and said: 'I can't stand it any more. You may have them.' '' She still looks him over, her famous eyes scrutinizing him from a portrait -- a prop painted for the film ''Jezebel'' -- that she personally hung in his office.</p><p>But it was Gloria Swanson who broke his heart. After wooing the film star for years, he was devastated when she promised her collection to the University of Texas, which, she told him, had proved its love for her by paying cash for her papers.</p><p>Archiving is a competitive pastime. ''He's been very good to spot writers and performing artists at early stages in their careers and acquire these for Boston University without spending a great deal of money,'' said Thomas F. Staley, director of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas. ''There's great breadth there.''</p><p>If tenacity doesn't get them, charm apparently will.</p><p>''He doesn't seem like an archivist; he seems like a boulevardier,'' said David Halberstam, the writer. Dr. Gotlieb accosted him in 1964, when he was just back from Saigon.</p><p>Nora London, widow of the opera star George London, calls him ''a real Renaissance man'' who can talk as easily with a mystery writer as with a mezzo-soprano. Dr. Gotlieb gives regular parties for the Friends of the Libraries of Boston University, a group of donors, many of whom have been archived, in places like Palm Beach, New York, Miami and London.</p><p>Dr. Gotlieb fosters the clubbishness of those in the collection. Securing Fred Astaire's memorabilia (right down to the shoes) helped him land Gene Kelly.</p><p>''I discovered that people like to be entombed together,'' he said. ''They are always interested in who else is on the shelf in the vault near them, you know.''</p><p>He clearly enjoys being surrounded by the former possessions of Isaac Asimov and Claude Rains. Yet he calls the awards and other bric-a-brac that adorn his office the ''effluvia'' of his collections, for it is the papers he really wants. The library's largest collection came from the former House speaker John McCormack, and the author with the most drafts of a single book is the literary critic, Maxwell Geismar, with 74 for ''Henry James and the Jacobites'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1963).</p><p>Dr. Gotlieb craves the papers enough to agree to stipulations. Shirley MacLaine's life (presumably the current one) is stored in light-blue boxes until she gives the word to open them to the public. The same for Robert Redford.</p><p>But sometimes he stands firm. When Coretta Scott King, Dr. King's widow, , wanted her husband's 83,000 documents moved to a center in Atlanta, Dr. Gotlieb and Boston University fought her in court. In 1993 the university won.</p><p>''He sat right in that chair and signed an agreement with me,'' Dr. Gotlieb said. ''He always expressed his happiness to me that the papers were here. The week before he was killed, I spoke with him concerning the matter.''</p><p>Heinrich Boll was a different story. Dr. Gotlieb began collecting his work years before he won the Nobel Prize in literature, before he had even been translated into English.</p><p>''He asked Gotlieb for his collection back because he really needed it for financial purposes,'' said John Silber, chancellor of Boston University. ''Gotlieb sent it back. He didn't have to. But that quality has also played a part in his success.''</p><p>Dealing with the living rather than the dead, Dr. Gotlieb jokes about the scars on his knees from all the groveling he has done.</p><p>''No matter how well known or how successful you are, you need an element of constant reassurance,'' he said. ''I now get calls: 'Tell me, tell me, Howard, that I'm going to win the Nobel Prize for literature some day. Tell me, tell me I'm going to win the Pulitzer.' And you know, that's all they need to hear.''</p><p>Photos: Howard Gotlieb, curator of Boston University's special collections, with among other items, a painting, left, used in ''Jezebel'' and a portrait of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., right.
