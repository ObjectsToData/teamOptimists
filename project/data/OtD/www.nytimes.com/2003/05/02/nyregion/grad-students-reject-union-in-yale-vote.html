Its leaders were planning to seize on the results to pressure Yale to grant union recognition to the graduate students.</p><p>But when the final tally was announced yesterday, it turned out to be a stinging defeat for the pro-union group, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization.</p><p>The results -- 694 against having the group, known as GESO, as their union and 651 in favor -- were especially embarrassing because the group had organized the vote with procedures that were widely viewed as skewing the poll in its favor.</p><p>''Obviously I'm very surprised and disappointed,'' said Anita M. Seth, the group's chairwoman. ''It's a really split vote. We've always known that Yale is a very hard place to organize a union because it's the most antiunion place.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Ms. Seth said her group and its opponents agreed yesterday not to count 80 challenged ballots, concluding that they would not change the results. She said the group would step up its efforts to win support in departments where it was weak.</p><p>Labor experts said the vote could hurt efforts to unionize Yale's graduate students for years and would send a signal nationwide that graduate teaching and research assistants would not necessarily flock to join unions.</p><p>''It's clearly a major setback,'' said Harry Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell, where graduate students voted, 1,351 to 580, against unionizing last October. ''The overall record for graduate student unionization has been pretty strong, but with the last two big votes, at Yale and Cornell, going against unionization, it may be signaling that something of considerable significance is going on.''</p><p>Opponents of unionization gave many reasons for the surprising results. Many graduate students said GESO's organizers were too aggressive and its leadership too undemocratic. Some said they had developed negative feelings about unionization because Yale's main unions had engaged in so many strikes and fights with the university.</p><p>In addition, some graduate students complained that the pro-union group had organized the vote unfairly. They noted that it had designated just one polling place, close to the humanities buildings, where pro-union sentiment was strongest, and far from the science buildings, where antiunion sentiment was greatest.</p><p>''They didn't do it fairly,'' said Shou-chih Isaac Yen, a fifth-year graduate student from Taiwan. ''It's the end of the semester, people were preparing final exams and papers, and a lot of people didn't know about the election. GESO did notify all the potential voters who will vote yes. It didn't notify the other people. That's cheating.''</p><p>Yale officials repeatedly said they would not honor the vote because it was supervised by the League of Women Voters and was not a government-supervised election run by the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>Yale has backed the position of Columbia and Brown, which are seeking to overturn a two-year-old labor board ruling that found that graduate students at private universities had the right to unionize.</p><p>''This vote confirms what we've been well aware of for some time,'' said Helaine Klasky, a Yale spokeswoman. ''Many graduate students do not want to be represented by GESO and have serious concerns about unionization.''</p><p>The pro-union group's leaders said they chose not to pursue a labor board election because Yale officials had said they might appeal the results, a process that could lead to years of litigation.</p><p>On April 21, nine days before the polling, the pro-union group announced that the vote would take place, leading critics to say that it was trying to ram through an election without full debate and without letting the opposition mobilize. Nonetheless, opponents, spearheaded by a new group, At What Cost, set up a Web site, put up posters and urged as many students as possible to vote.</p><p>''This is not a victory for At What Cost,'' said Katherine Marsland, a graduate student in psychology who is the group's president. ''This is a victory for open discussion on this very important issue.''</p><p>With many graduate students saying they supported unionization, but not with GESO, many posters said: ''This is not a vote about unionization. This is a vote about GESO.''</p><p>''There's a tremendous amount of frustration with the tactics that GESO uses,'' said Claudia Brittenham, a graduate student in art history. She complained that the pro-union group's organizers went to her home 10 times to try to persuade her. Several students said they were thinking of seeking temporary restraining orders to stop such home visits.</p><p>''I consider myself pro-union, but I know I don't want GESO to represent me,'' Ms. Brittenham said. ''Their deaf ear is what really concerned me.''</p><p>Several graduate students voiced fears that if GESO became their union, it would be dominated by Yale's two other union locals, which helped finance the unionization drive. Those locals represent 2,900 clerical workers and 1,200 cleaning, dining hall and maintenance workers and are part of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union.</p><p>''I don't feel embarrassed on this at all,'' said John Wilhelm, the hotel employee union's president. ''GESO deserves an enormous amount of credit for being willing to do unilaterally what we've urged the university to do collaboratively with them, and that is to have an open, democratic process that gives a snapshot on where the graduate teaching and research assistants stand on the question of unionization.''</p>                </div>
