    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Reading Harlan Coben's latest best-selling thriller on a plane from New York to Australia underscored for me just how deeply Victor Hugo's ''Les Misérables'' has penetrated the American psyche. When Coben compares one of his characters to Inspector Javert, there was no need to gloss the reference: every reader knows he means a rigid, vengeful individual obsessed with the letter of the law irrespective of human cost.    However, I'm not naïve enough to suspect that Victor Hugo's huge novel of crime and revolution in early 19th-century France is the work from which readers are likely to get the reference. It is rather the translation of the novel into perhaps the most successful Broadway musical of our time that is the common reference. And now, after a stunning 15 years, ''Les Miz'' is to close, and I can't help feeling that its departure carries a deeper significance than is usual when Broadway hits depart.   ">

And now, after a stunning 15 years, ''Les Miz'' is to close, and I can't help feeling that its departure carries a deeper significance than is usual when Broadway hits depart.</p><p>Of course, every long-lasting musical must eventually pass through the same three phases of life -- it begins as a sensation, solidifies into an institution and ends its days as an object of nostalgia. Nostalgia was certainly much in evidence on the afternoon this spring that I saw the production in New York. The producers had deliberately catered to the sentiment by bringing back some of the first performers, including the original Javert, Terrence Mann.</p><p>Chatting to audience members at intermission, I met the inevitable serial attendees, a few boasting more than six visits. One young Korean girl was on a mission to see ''Les Miz'' all over the world, though she never doubted that the one in New York was the ur-performance and all others were pale imitations. Some people had seen the musical long ago and now had children or grandchildren to whom they wished to bequeath the experience. One visually handicapped young man sitting in the aisle sang me passages from the songs that had been cut since his previous visit (apparently in order to reduce overtime costs).</p>                </div>

                    <p>Actually, nostalgia suffuses the musical at a number of levels and helps explain its potency. Several people confided to me that they loved the story of Jean Valjean, the persecuted convict, not despite but because of its harshness. To them, ''Les Mis&eacute;rables'' evokes a world we have lost, when life was physically and morally starker. Coincidentally, the man who first used the word nostalgia in this sense was also a Frenchman and a contemporary of Hugo's. In a play of 1855, ''Le Mariage d'Olympe,'' &Eacute;mile Augier referred to nostalgia as a perverse, retrospective longing for hard times. He called it ''la nostalgie de la boue'' -- the longing that a duck feels to return to the clammy mud of its origins even as it swims in a limpid lake surrounded by swans.</p><p>A yearning for such moral intensity washes through the audiences of ''Les Mis&eacute;rables.'' Such is the appeal of melodrama, heightened in this case by a collection of shakingly rousing songs. Melodrama allows us to rage at the villain and bawl for the victims; it purges all the ambiguities and uncertainties of contemporary life. This sentiment explains, too, why authors like Hugo and Charles Dickens, whose novels are dense with local and historical particularity and handicapped by an awesome wordiness, can still turn out to be such gripping sources for modern musicals.</p><p>There was another reason for us in the seats that night I revisited ''Les Mis&eacute;rables'' to feel lachrymose. It was literally the eve of the deadline of George W. Bush's ultimatum to Saddam Hussein. Tomorrow or the next day, we all knew, America would almost certainly be at war. Throughout the performance, the audience seemed to be quivering in anticipation of the moment when the cast would burst into the words:</p><p>Will you join in our crusade?</p><p>Who will be strong and stand with me?</p><p>Somewhere beyond the barricade</p><p>Is there a world you long to see?</p><p>Do you hear the people sing?</p><p>Say, do you hear the distant drums?</p><p>It is the future that they bring</p><p>When tomorrow comes!</p><p>As one the performers reminded me in a conversation after the show, ''Les Miz'' is a remarkable example of what literary critics call a multivalent text: there is something in it for everyone. You can identify with the Parisian students' noble crusade against a tyrannical regime, or you can shake your head at the na&iuml;ve fanaticism of this young band of terrorists, or you can have your heart rent by the futility of war when little Gavroche dies so portentously amid a hail of grapeshot.</p><p>This cast member told me he had been performing the show in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and had never known anything like the nightly audience responses. Again and again, people came to be wracked and relieved, to undergo some personal catharsis. Such, after all, was an original purpose of theater. ''Les Miz'' helped New Yorkers get through their shock and pain. ''This was the show I wanted to see again,'' wrote one critic after Sept. 11. ''I wanted to immerse myself in a stirring tale of ordinary people rising above mankind's inhumanity with compassion and faith.''</p><p>And I at least will mourn another sort of loss when the doors shut today for the final time on this epic of French revolutionary idealism. Symbolically, it marks the closing of what has been a glorious 15-year experiment of cultural amity between France and America. ''Les Miz'' is the first French work ever to make it as a Broadway musical, and it has been a source of pride to the French that their leading contemporary musical artists, Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boublil, and their greatest popular writer, Victor Hugo, should make such a cultural mark on America.</p><p>How fitting also that the two countries that forged an original kinship around the lofty ideas of liberty should re-embrace over Hugo's tale of 19th-century social insurrection.</p><p>Yet is happening at a moment when the old suspicions and enmities are back. Americans are no longer crying over the death of Fantine, they're raging at the arrogance of Jacques Chirac. A cultural window has slammed shut and both countries will be the poorer for it. The departure of ''Les Miz'' seems to mark the end of Broadway's great entente cordiale. I fear that Valjean will find no sequel.</p><p>Drawings</p>                </div>
