SHALVA-The Center for Mentally and Physically Challenged Children in Israel mourns the passing of Mr. Laurence Alan Tisch, a pillar of Jewish communal life for decades. He merited to live a long, full life and to establish a legacy of extraordinary 'chesed' -loving kindness, that he not only practiced but also instilled so masterfully in his children and grandchildren. He was viewed with the utmost esteem by all who knew him and was a true giant of the spirit. He led by example in his modest personal life as well as in his successful business life. A true American, he epitomized the finest qualities of an American Jewish businessman, whose humility was instructive to many, and whose winning record was legendary, equaled only by his philanthropy in New York City, at NYU and its Hospital, its children's zoo, his beloved Metropolitan Museum, and reaching overseas to the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, the Moshe Dayan Archeological Collection, and countless other worthy institutions. We express our profound and deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Billie, and to his children, Andrew, Daniel, our committed friend and dedicated SHALVA board member James, and Thomas, his brother, Bob, and wife, Joan, and to the entire Tisch family. His legacy lives on in the sterling qualities exhibited by his family. ''May you be comforted amongst all other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.'' As Mr. Tisch provided respite during his life to hundreds of families with handicapped and special needs children serviced by SHALVA, we pray that he now has eternal respite and peace, as his most deserved, and earned, reward.

Bob, Joan, Steve, Jamie, Laurie and Jonathan and their children feel blessed to have spent so many wonderful years with Bob's brother and our dear ''Uncle Larry.'' We learned wisdom, passion, integrity, and ''tikkun olam'' by following his example. His remarkable legacy will remain with us forever. The Preston Robert Tisch Family    TISCH -- Laurence Alan. SHALVA-The Center for Mentally and Physically Challenged Children in Israel mourns the passing of Mr. Laurence Alan Tisch, a pillar of Jewish communal life for decades. He merited to live a long, full life and to establish a legacy of extraordinary 'chesed' -loving kindness, that he not only practiced but also instilled so masterfully in his children and grandchildren. He was viewed with the utmost esteem by all who knew him and was a true giant of the spirit. He led by example in his modest personal life as well as in his successful business life. A true American, he epitomized the finest qualities of an American Jewish businessman, whose humility was instructive to many, and whose winning record was legendary, equaled only by his philanthropy in New York City, at NYU and its Hospital, its children's zoo, his beloved Metropolitan Museum, and reaching overseas to the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, the Moshe Dayan Archeological Collection, and countless other worthy institutions. We express our profound and deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Billie, and to his children, Andrew, Daniel, our committed friend and dedicated SHALVA board member James, and Thomas, his brother, Bob, and wife, Joan, and to the entire Tisch family. His legacy lives on in the sterling qualities exhibited by his family. ''May you be comforted amongst all other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.'' As Mr. Tisch provided respite during his life to hundreds of families with handicapped and special needs children serviced by SHALVA, we pray that he now has eternal respite and peace, as his most deserved, and earned, reward. Nathan Low, Hillel Weinberger, Leon Wagner, Rabbi Kalman Samuels, and the entire Board of Directors of the American Friends of SHALVA.    TISCH--Laurence A.

                    <p>TISCH--Laurence A. Bob, Joan, Steve, Jamie, Laurie and Jonathan and their children feel blessed to have spent so many wonderful years with Bob's brother and our dear ''Uncle Larry.'' We learned wisdom, passion, integrity, and ''tikkun olam'' by following his example. His remarkable legacy will remain with us forever. The Preston Robert Tisch Family</p><p>TISCH -- Laurence Alan. SHALVA-The Center for Mentally and Physically Challenged Children in Israel mourns the passing of Mr. Laurence Alan Tisch, a pillar of Jewish communal life for decades. He merited to live a long, full life and to establish a legacy of extraordinary 'chesed' -loving kindness, that he not only practiced but also instilled so masterfully in his children and grandchildren. He was viewed with the utmost esteem by all who knew him and was a true giant of the spirit. He led by example in his modest personal life as well as in his successful business life. A true American, he epitomized the finest qualities of an American Jewish businessman, whose humility was instructive to many, and whose winning record was legendary, equaled only by his philanthropy in New York City, at NYU and its Hospital, its children's zoo, his beloved Metropolitan Museum, and reaching overseas to the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, the Moshe Dayan Archeological Collection, and countless other worthy institutions. We express our profound and deepest sympathy to his beloved wife, Billie, and to his children, Andrew, Daniel, our committed friend and dedicated SHALVA board member James, and Thomas, his brother, Bob, and wife, Joan, and to the entire Tisch family. His legacy lives on in the sterling qualities exhibited by his family. ''May you be comforted amongst all other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.'' As Mr. Tisch provided respite during his life to hundreds of families with handicapped and special needs children serviced by SHALVA, we pray that he now has eternal respite and peace, as his most deserved, and earned, reward. Nathan Low, Hillel Weinberger, Leon Wagner, Rabbi Kalman Samuels, and the entire Board of Directors of the American Friends of SHALVA.</p><p>TISCH--Laurence A. The Board of Trustees of Skidmore College and the entire campus community deeply mourn the death of Laurence A. Tisch, husband of alumna and trustee Wilma Stein Tisch '48, benefactor, friend, and honorary degree recipient. He was known widely for his transformational philanthrophy in education, the arts, and humanitarian causes. Together with ''Billie,'' his wife of 55 years, Laurence Tisch played a major role in the advancement of Skidmore College and its mission. In honor of the couple's generosity and leadership, the Tisch name abounds on the Skidmore campus. The Tisch Learning Center, dedicated in 1994, fosters studentfaculty interaction and collaboration across the disciplines. The Tisch Chair in Arts and Sciences, held by Professor of English Robert Boyers, furthers the cause of academic excellence and critical thinking. The Tisch Endowed Scholarship Fund provides crucial financial aid to Skidmore students. In 1994 Skidmore awarded Laurence Tisch an honorary doctor of laws degree on the occasion of his serving as the F. William Harder Lecturer in Business Administration. All of us in the Skidmore community send our deepest condolences to his wife, Billie; to his sons Andrew, Daniel, James and Thomas; to his brother Robert and wife Joan; and to the entire Tisch family, including his grandniece Emily, Skidmore class of 2004, and her parents, Laurie and Donald. Suzanne Corbet Thomas '62 Chair, Board of Trustees Philip A. Glotzbach President</p><p>TISCH--Laurence A. The American Jewish Committee mourns with profound sadness the passing of a dear friend and cherished benefactor, Laurence A. Tisch. Larry was a member of AJC's President's Cabinet and National Leadership Council. We were honored to pay tribute to him with our prestigious Herbert H. Lehman Award in 1981 and to be the recipient of his intelligence and wise counsel for many years. An individual of unparalleled professional and personal integrity, Larry's generosity and broad-based philanthropy touched countless lives in a multitude of ways. He loved New York City and his dedication to children, medicine, education, the arts, and the environment was legendary. A devoted friend to the Jewish community, his inspirational leadership and devotion spanned our nation and the globe. His support for Israel was unwavering and passionate. Our city, American society and the Jewish people have lost a man of incomparable vision, goodness, and human kindness, but his legacy will live on in our minds and hearts for generations to come. We express our heartfelt condolences to his beloved wife, Billie, their children, grandchildren, and the rest of the grieving family. Harold Tanner, President David A.
