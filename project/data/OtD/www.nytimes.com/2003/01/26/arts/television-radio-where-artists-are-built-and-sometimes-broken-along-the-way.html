    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THE Juilliard School, which proudly and probably rightly thinks of itself as the nation's best arts conservatory, dates back to 1905. But it, and those who admire it, haven't waited until the centenary to start their celebrations. On Wednesday, a two-hour documentary, ''Juilliard,'' will have its premiere on PBS. (Already in bookstores is a coffee-table tome drawing from and expanding on the documentary, which stands up handsomely in its own right.)    Let it be said that the program is really fun and absorbing. It shows all manner of famous artists, both when they were young and today. Reminiscing about their school experiences, they give a sharp insight into the high-pressure world of Juilliard, and they give considerable hope that the school's long line of distinguished alumni will be continued by the present student body.

But it, and those who admire it, haven't waited until the centenary to start their celebrations. On Wednesday, a two-hour documentary, ''Juilliard,'' will have its premiere on PBS. (Already in bookstores is a coffee-table tome drawing from and expanding on the documentary, which stands up handsomely in its own right.)</p><p>Let it be said that the program is really fun and absorbing. It shows all manner of famous artists, both when they were young and today. Reminiscing about their school experiences, they give a sharp insight into the high-pressure world of Juilliard, and they give considerable hope that the school's long line of distinguished alumni will be continued by the present student body.</p><p>Juilliard (pronounced JOO-lee-ard, and routinely misspelled) traces its origins to the founding in 1905 of the Institute of Musical Art, which merged completely with the Juilliard Graduate School in 1946. For decades it was situated near or on the current site of the Manhattan School of Music, at Claremont Avenue and 122nd Street, finally moving to its Lincoln Center digs in 1969. Over the years, divisions for children and adults were added. The curriculum, at first strictly classical music, was expanded to include opera, then dance, then theater, then jazz, along with ever more attention to the humanities and the practicalities of careers in the arts.</p><p>The alumni quoted or shown in the documentary, which was made by Maro Chermayeff for WNET's ''American Masters'' series, only skim the surface of the famous folk who have graced Juilliard's halls. A very partial list would include faculty members like William Schuman (the composer and longtime president, who became president of Lincoln Center), Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, Dorothy DeLay, Rosina Lh&eacute;vinne, Martha Graham, Jos&eacute; Lim&oacute;n, Antony Tudor and John Houseman. And students (some of whom became faculty) like Van Cliburn, Ren&eacute;e Fleming, James Levine, Audra McDonald, Yo-Yo Ma, Miles Davis (who attended but dropped out), Wynton Marsalis, Midori, Itzhak Perlman, Leontyne Price, Martha Clarke, Paul Taylor, Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone and Kevin Spacey. It's all pretty dizzying.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But what is perhaps most interesting about the documentary is the unflinching way it confronts the darker side of this famous place. Not that it isn't ultimately celebratory, and rightly so. One comes away almost awed by the devotion and intensity with which the teachers, and the self-motivated students themselves, go about the business of making the best better, a process that goes on every day in the fortress-like building on the corner of Broadway and 65th Street.</p><p>Two points are made at the outset. One is that Juilliard is the finest arts conservatory in the country, and its students and faculty are proud that it's the finest. The other is that pressure -- sometimes refining, sometimes crippling -- defines the place.</p><p>''There's something exhilarating about a place that says it's the best and really is the best,'' says the flutist Paula Robison. Anyone who has attended or worked at elite institutions knows what she's talking about. One realizes there are other places that may do as good a job, or better in certain circumstances. But one still gets a rush just walking around the campus or office or locker room, sensing the talent at every turn.</p><p>The actress Christine Baranski gives some hint of the excitement students feel when they're chosen for admission over hundreds of others. ''My mother was waiting for me down in Philharmonic Hall in the lobby,'' she tells us. ''I told her I'd gotten in, and we went to the Algonquin Hotel and had manhattans. That was a celebration. It was just one of the great moments of my life, getting into that school. I was this Polish girl from Cheektowaga who had an acting dream. To me, it was just the top.'' For those who haven't brushed up on their New York geography, Cheektowaga is a suburb of Buffalo.</p><p>But all that exhilaration and all that talent mean all that pressure when students are competing for the same roles, the same solo opportunities, the same teachers' favors, the same career opportunities. Or even competing to be allowed to graduate, since a fair number are forced to depart prematurely.</p><p>''Pressure is a word that is synonymous with Juilliard,'' Marvin Hamlisch recalls. Robin Williams suggests that with great talent often comes great sensitivity, and students ''sometimes can't handle it.''</p><p>Sarah Wolfson, a student soprano, says she felt compelled to apply because ''I didn't want to be just the big fish in a small pond.'' But she was quickly chastened. ''It isn't all cookies and cream all the time,'' she says. ''There are some bitter things that can come into play, but that's the professional world.''</p><p>There is no doubt much to be said for preparing students for life's cruelties. But the film does gently call some of Juilliard's presuppositions into question.</p>                </div>
