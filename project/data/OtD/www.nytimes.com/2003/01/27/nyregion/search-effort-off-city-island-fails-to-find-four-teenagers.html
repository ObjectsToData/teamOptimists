Officials said last night that if they had gone into the water, there was little hope that they had survived.</p><p>As police helicopters, harbor launches and Coast Guard rescue vessels crisscrossed the western reaches of the sound and combed its archipelago of islands, scores of City Islanders steeped in nautical tradition launched a small armada of private boats and joined the most extensive local sea-air search in years.</p><p>The most obvious destination for what many thought was a nocturnal adventure -- Hart Island, with its storied potter's field graveyard and abandoned missile silos, less than a mile off City Island -- yielded no signs that the teenagers had been there. Dozens of other islands between Westchester and Nassau Counties were scoured. Scuba divers searched shoreline waters, but turned up nothing.</p><p>Despite freezing air and water temperatures, families and friends held out hope through the day for the missing teenagers, Charles Wertenbaker, 16, of City Island, Henry Badillo, 17, of the Bronx, and Andrew Melnikov, 16, and Max Guarino, 17, both of Manhattan, all described as good students and aspiring musicians.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But as darkness closed in and late-afternoon temperatures plunged again, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly informed the parents inside a trailer on a windswept dock that the search was being called off for the night.</p><p>Mr. Kelly also disclosed that a police dispatcher had received a 12-second call on Friday night, a half-hour after the four teenagers were last seen, from a cellphone that Henry Badillo had been carrying. It reported that their boat was out on Long Island Sound, somewhere off City Island, and was taking on water.</p><p>The call ended abruptly, before further information could be elicited, and Mr. Kelly said no action was taken because the dispatcher concluded that there was insufficient information.</p><p>Thus, an extensive search was not begun until noon on Saturday after members of the families reported that the teenagers were missing.</p><p>''It was distressing news to the family members,'' Mr. Kelly said of the lack of an immediate police response. ''The call was logged, but nothing was dispatched,'' he said. ''There was not enough information.'' He did not say that the dispatcher had erred, but added, ''We're looking into and reviewing procedures this evening.''</p><p>It was unclear whether ordering an immediate search-and-rescue operation might have made a difference. Asked how long it would have taken to mount such an effort, Mr. Kelly said: ''Assuming we were to dispatch our air rescue units from Floyd Bennett Field, with our scuba team aboard, I'd say 20 minutes at the optimum.''</p><p>Still, such a search would have been undertaken in darkness, and would have had no precise location on which to focus.</p><p>Mr. Kelly said the search would resume at dawn today, but if the teenagers had gone out on the water, the passage of a third night of brutal cold would further reduce the already slim chances that the boys would be found alive.</p><p>''The water temperature was 33 degrees and the air temperature was in the teens,'' Mr. Kelly said at a late-afternoon news conference on City Island. ''Difficult conditions for a human to endure.''</p><p>Mr. Kelly said the police were looking into reports that the four teenagers had attended a party Thursday night, at which they were overheard talking about rowing out on the sound. On Friday night, he said, they attended another party, and were last seen about 9:30 p.m., carrying oars and Mr. Wertenbaker's acoustic guitar toward the docks and marinas on the island's eastern shore.</p><p>The guitar was found on Saturday by Mr. Wertenbaker's family in a cemetery by the docks, and police search dogs traced the teenagers' scent to Barron's Marina nearby, where an eight-foot fiberglass rowboat was missing. The authorities said it had most likely been taken by the four, who were believed to have rowed into the sound on a dangerous lark. The rowboat had not been found last night.</p><p>Mr. Wertenbaker is a student at the Bronx High School of Science, while the other three attended Humanities Preparatory Academy in Manhattan, relatives and friends said. Mr. Wertenbaker and Mr. Melnikov, a former student at Bronx Science, had been members of a band that had broken up, but were planning to form a new one with Mr. Guarino and Mr. Badillo.</p><p>All day yesterday, the families of the missing youths, grim and sometimes sobbing, shuttled between the City Island home of Dr. Christian Wertenbaker, an ophthalmologist, and a police command post on the pier at the foot of Fordham Street, the landing for a Hart Island ferry operated by the city Department of Correction. (Rikers Island inmates work at the graveyard on Hart Island.)</p><p>Led by harbor and aviation units of the New York Police Department, the search was joined by the Coast Guard and boats of the New Rochelle and Nassau County police. The search area encompassed 60 square miles of waterways around City Island -- Eastchester Bay to the west and Long Island Sound from Larchmont to Hempstead Harbor to the north and east.</p>                </div>
