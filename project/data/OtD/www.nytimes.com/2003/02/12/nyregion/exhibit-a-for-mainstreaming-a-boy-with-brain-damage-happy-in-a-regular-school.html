One classmate recited an ode to climbing trees; another read verses about chasing ice cream trucks.</p><p>The assignment was to write a poem recalling life at 9 years old. But Malcolm, his face blank, did not volunteer to read his aloud.</p><p>At 9, Malcolm chased students on the playground and practiced long division in his fourth-grade class. Today, at 13, he uses a wheelchair to get to class. His speech is slurred and he cannot write on his own -- the results of a brain injury he sustained when he was hit by a truck in 1999.</p><p>Yet he moves through the halls slapping high fives with the other boys and winking at the girls. If he could walk, it would certainly be with a swagger.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In New York City, where more than 72,000 special education students are in separate classrooms, Malcolm Thomas is the exception to the rule. He could easily have been placed in District 75, a citywide district that serves almost 20,000 of the city's most severely disabled students.</p><p>But Malcolm's mother and advocates for special education spent countless hours attending meetings and filling out forms to get him into a regular classroom. Now, he spends his days with seventh graders at the Upper Lab School in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.</p><p>The social benefits of Malcolm's education seem clear: he enjoys school and has many friends. But it is difficult to determine exactly what Malcolm is learning. To spend a week with him is to see the benefits and the drawbacks of inclusion, as the policy of placing special education students in mainstream classes is called.</p><p>Federal law mandates that such students be placed in the ''least-restrictive environment.'' Three years ago, the city's Board of Education approved a plan to mainstream more students. But New York lags far behind other cities in this regard, according to a report from the Least Restrictive Environment Coalition.</p><p>More than 50 percent of the city's special education students still spend most of their time in separate classrooms, while the figure is about 8 percent statewide and 20 percent nationally. The number of special education students in regular classrooms has increased by less than 4 percentage points since 2000.</p><p>The slow pace of the shift is, in part, a consequence of sheer volume -- there are more than 140,000 special education students in New York City, a number that is larger than the entire student population of many school systems elsewhere. And unlike other cities, New York has a district dedicated solely to special education.</p><p>Linda Wernikoff, the deputy superintendent for special education, acknowledged that the city has been moving slowly. In the past, the city ''relied very heavily on segregated classes,'' she said, adding, ''You do not change 20 years in a year or two.''</p><p>Malcolm, like any other special education student, needs extra resources, including a laptop computer and a full-time aide and a special education teacher to jointly teach each of his classes. The school system could not provide cost comparisons for mainstreaming a special education student versus keeping the student segregated, in part because the level of services can vary widely. On average, the city spends $28,000 a year on each special education student.</p><p>In class, Malcolm's attention wanders often, and he drifts off without warning. During one period, he might stretch his arms in a huge yawn before putting his head on a desk to fall asleep. Later, he might be explaining what makes shapes mathematically similar.</p><p>''You don't know what will grab him,'' said Sam Affoumado, one of Malcolm's humanities teachers. ''When you see that he is interested in something, you have to capitalize on that right away.''</p><p>In a recent class, Mr. Affoumado asked students what self-confidence meant. Several raised their hands, but Mr. Affoumado knew whom to call on.</p><p>''You can think you are good, but you're really only good if people say so,'' Malcolm said, before turning the conversation to one of his favorite topics, rap music. ''Rappers have to impress other people. They can't just think their songs are good. It matters what other people think.''</p><p>Malcolm knows what other people think. He is a teenager who is constantly trying to impress others. Although his brain injury has impaired his speech, he does not hesitate to perform freestyle raps for anyone who will listen. Students call him Mr. Popular, a name he has earned by knowing nearly everyone in the school.</p><p>With his perfectly braided cornrows, broad smile and long, curly eyelashes, Malcolm could pass for a teenage heartthrob. He wears stylish sweat suits and trendy down jackets, like many of today's MTV stars. ''I know I'm cool,'' he says often.</p><p>Around other students, Malcolm is all smiles. During a fire drill, he stayed inside with a high school senior who had a sprained ankle. ''Do you want to hear one of my raps?'' Malcolm asked him, just moments after they met.</p><p>Malcolm, who goes by the name Lil Popi when he performs for friends, began to rhyme: ''See, I talk slow, but I sank low. I'll steal your girl before you know and don't say I never told you so.''</p>                </div>
