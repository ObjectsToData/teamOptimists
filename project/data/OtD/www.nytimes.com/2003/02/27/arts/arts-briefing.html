    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" HIGHLIGHTS    HONORS -- Louise Bourgeois, 92, has won the $100,000 Wolf Prize for the arts. She was cited by the jury ''for an oeuvre, that for six decades and encompassing a remarkable range of media, has sustained aesthetic and formal innovation, intellectual complexity and contemporary relevance.'' With Ambassador Alon Pinkas, consul general of Israel in New York, as the host, Ms. Bourgeois is to be honored today at a reception at her Manhattan home. The prize, awarded by the Wolf Foundation in Israel, annually recognizes the outstanding achievements of scientists and artists regardless of race, religion or political view. The awards were established by Ricardo Wolf, a German-born diplomat and philanthropist who served as Cuba's ambassador to Israel.    WHEN HARRY MEETS HOMER -- Homer Simpson, left, and his family will be chatting up J. K. Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, outside a British bookshop in a forthcoming episode of ''The Simpsons'' on television. A spokeswoman for Ms. Rowling told Reuters yesterday that Ms. Rowling had done a voice-over for the episode, which takes the beer-swilling Homer and his clan to Britain to find a woman with whom Grandpa Simpson had a fling during World War II. ''The Simpsons bump into J. K. Rowling outside a bookshop and they talk all about Harry Potter,'' Don Payne, executive producer of ''The Simpsons,'' told The Sun of London. The episode will also feature Sir Ian McKellen, a star of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, whom the Simpsons jinx by defying superstition and mentioning ''Macbeth,'' the play they intend to see him in.">

She was cited by the jury ''for an oeuvre, that for six decades and encompassing a remarkable range of media, has sustained aesthetic and formal innovation, intellectual complexity and contemporary relevance.'' With Ambassador Alon Pinkas, consul general of Israel in New York, as the host, Ms. Bourgeois is to be honored today at a reception at her Manhattan home. The prize, awarded by the Wolf Foundation in Israel, annually recognizes the outstanding achievements of scientists and artists regardless of race, religion or political view. The awards were established by Ricardo Wolf, a German-born diplomat and philanthropist who served as Cuba's ambassador to Israel.    WHEN HARRY MEETS HOMER -- Homer Simpson, left, and his family will be chatting up J. K. Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, outside a British bookshop in a forthcoming episode of ''The Simpsons'' on television. A spokeswoman for Ms. Rowling told Reuters yesterday that Ms. Rowling had done a voice-over for the episode, which takes the beer-swilling Homer and his clan to Britain to find a woman with whom Grandpa Simpson had a fling during World War II. ''The Simpsons bump into J. K. Rowling outside a bookshop and they talk all about Harry Potter,'' Don Payne, executive producer of ''The Simpsons,'' told The Sun of London. The episode will also feature Sir Ian McKellen, a star of the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, whom the Simpsons jinx by defying superstition and mentioning ''Macbeth,'' the play they intend to see him in."></div>

''The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life'' (1998), a multimedia installation, implies something sinister about territory and ownership while investigating the lawn, that symbol of order and domestic harmony. In ''Tourisms: suitCase Studies,'' each of 50 identical open suitcases suspended from a ceiling reveals a shrine to a tourist attraction in each state in America. And the much discussed ''Blur Building'' (2002) consisted of a fog of mist from 31,000 nozzles around a steel structure, creating what appeared to be a white cloud afloat on a lake. All these are the work of the husband-and-wife architecture and design team of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. The first American museum retrospective of their buildings, site-specific art, video installations and performance pieces opens on Saturday at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan. ''Scanning: The Aberrant Architectures of Diller &amp; Scofidio,'' with new works as well as a sampling of their output during the last 20 years, will be on view through June 1.</p>                </div>

                    <p>TOGETHER AGAIN -- Remember the Kowalskis of New Orleans? Stanley and Stella? And Stella's alluring sister, Blanche DuBois, so dependent on the kindness of strangers? They, and Blanche's suitor, Harold Mitchell, will be paying a visit on Sunday, when the North Carolina Dance Theater, under the artistic direction of Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, presents the New York premiere of its two-act ballet ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Based on the Tennessee Williams play and choreographed by Mark Diamond, this re-creation of decadence in 1950's New Orleans will be danced at 2 p.m. at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College in Flatbush. The program also includes Nacho Duato's ''Jardi Tancat.''</p><p>PICTURING JAPAN -- Here are 19th-century portraits of samurai and the Meiji emperor, the battlefields of early 20th-century war with Russia, scrolls picturing major cities, exquisite landscapes, still-life arrangements and urban scenes (left). These are among 200 photographs by 110 photographers gathered from collections worldwide in what is described as the first comprehensive exhibition in the West to survey the history of work by Japanese photographers. Opening on Sunday at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and bound for the Cleveland Museum of Art, this show examines the evolution of Japanese photography, the relationship between its aesthetics and the country's historical and cultural evolution, and that art form's influence on photographers around the world. ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' complemented by books and periodicals that provide a context for the images, continues through April 27.</p><p>LAST CHANCE -- The highly praised exhibition of the art of Gerhard Richter that opened last year at the Museum of Modern Art in New York is winding up its United States tour at the Smithsonian Institution's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington. Opening today, ''Gerhard Richter: 40 Years of Painting'' consists of more than 120 works. That show, also seen in Chicago and San Francisco, continues through May 18.</p><p>FOOTNOTES</p><p>''The Good Old Days: When Christians, Jews and Muslims Got Along'' is the topic of a symposium to be presented tonight by the New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University. The discussion, moderated by Lawrence Weschler and featuring the Iraqi exile dissident Kanan Makiya and Maria Rosa Menocal, a professor at Yale, will be at 7:30 in the Silver Center in Hemmerdinger Hall, at 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place in Greenwich Village. . . . Rosemarie Garipoli was named yesterday to the newly created post of executive director of the Campaign for Lincoln Center. She will lead an effort to raise money for Lincoln Center's redevelopment. Ms. Garipoli led similar drives for the New York Botanical Garden and the Guggenheim Foundation.</p><p>Photos: The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, designed by Diller & Scofidio.
