These are troubled times. We have seen doctors striking to protest soaring insurance premiums. In some states like Florida and West Virginia, neurosurgeons and others in high-risk, high-liability specialties are closing shop or retiring early. Insurance companies blame rising claims and bigger jury awards for their rate hikes. Personal-injury lawyers deny their responsibility and insist that the insurance companies have invested poorly. Organized medicine and President Bush push for tort reform, including a cap on awards. And while the powerful lobbies jockey to preserve their interests, patients suffer.   ">

                    <p>After coming through a long malpractice suit, a physician friend of mine said to me, ''Now I think of the patient as the enemy.''</p><p>These are troubled times. We have seen doctors striking to protest soaring insurance premiums. In some states like Florida and West Virginia, neurosurgeons and others in high-risk, high-liability specialties are closing shop or retiring early. Insurance companies blame rising claims and bigger jury awards for their rate hikes. Personal-injury lawyers deny their responsibility and insist that the insurance companies have invested poorly. Organized medicine and President Bush push for tort reform, including a cap on awards. And while the powerful lobbies jockey to preserve their interests, patients suffer.</p><p>Medicine is in a sense a victim of its own success. Transplants of heart, lungs and liver seem so routine that we are surprised when they don't take. A fetus can be operated on in the womb, and extremely premature babies regularly survive, and so we now view any birth-related injury as somebody's fault. The hype engendered by stem cells and the human genome has only boosted our expectations. We presume a cure. A bad outcome is a betrayal; it is un-American. Hence when a debilitated 90-year-old enters a nursing home with giant bedsores and succumbs to pneumonia six months later, the family uses the bedsores as evidence of malpractice.</p><p>There was a time when every large city hospital had wards for diphtheria and scarlet fever. Doctoring in that pre-antibiotic era was mostly about observation and hope (that the body would win the battle). That passive medicine has given way to aggressive, interventionist care, reflected in our modern intensive care units, newborn nurseries and transplant units. Organ bouquets are harvested here and planted there. Tubes routinely pierce bladder, vein, artery, heart, trachea or ventricle of the brain; each tube serves a vital function, but at the same time breaches one of our physical defenses. Meanwhile, chemotherapy, antibiotics, steroids all compromise the immune system even as they produce other desired effects. Progress has a price, and it's often infection. A century ago, to have E. coli or one of the other bacteria we carry in our bowels cause bloodstream infection was almost unheard of, worthy of a case report in The New England Journal of Medicine. Now bloodstream infection by these bacteria is a major cause of the estimated 100,000 deaths a year from sepsis. It's not so much that these bacteria have changed (they have); instead, this increase reflects the present invasive nature of hospital medicine. But sepsis as a consequence of heroic treatment does not constitute negligence. To prove malpractice, you need more than a bad outcome; there has to be significant deviation from the usual standard of care.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Still, I suspect the great majority of malpractice suits are for bad outcomes. Take a woman who has had no prenatal care and who turns up in a hospital in premature labor. An obstetrician and a neonatologist get involved and deliver the best care, but the baby is born damaged. A personal-injury lawyer (who learns about the case through paid touts in the hospital) encourages the mother to sue. The lawyer knows that bringing the affected child into the courtroom will have a powerful effect on the jury, which will be persuaded to believe this is negligence, not just a bad outcome. Insurance companies settle rather than take a chance with a jury.</p><p>We physicians grumble about personal-injury lawyers who call out from the backs of phone books and from atop billboards. But the truth is that these lawyers all too easily can shop around and find physicians to serve as expert witnesses, physicians who can (for a fee) testify that a bad outcome is in fact negligence. A jury trial then becomes a war of experts. Given the possible intricacies of a case, jurors may not grasp the issues when they go into deliberations. But they do remember what they don't like about modern medicine and the way it is impersonal and driven by money. They do remember the last time they were wronged by an insurance company or an H.M.O. or treated shabbily in a doctor's office. Here is an opportunity to get even, perhaps. The doctor becomes the enemy.</p><p>Solutions are desperately needed. I think we could start by sending all malpractice suits to regional panels of judges, physicians and consumer advocates to screen and eliminate those with no merit. And organized medicine could rein in the professional-physician expert witness: much like jurors, specialty physicians might serve as expert witnesses when their turn comes up for a nominal fee. Lawyers would not be able to shop around for an expert witness with just the right testimony. (A disclaimer: In 20 years, I have served as an expert witness four times.) And when we are patients, we could insist on being equal partners in our care. We might bring along family and friends when we interact with doctors and see that all our questions are answered and our expectations realistic. Medicine is fantastic in what it can accomplish, but there are real and clear risks.</p><p>A wise former judge once told me, ''Patients who like their doctors don't sue, no matter what the lawyer says.'' Our efforts in medical schools to turn out skilled yet empathetic physicians who communicate clearly and who can put themselves in their patients' shoes is critical to stemming the malpractice crisis. Patients sue when their feelings are ignored or when they are angered by lack of genuine concern for their welfare. If psychiatrists, family physicians and oncologists are sued less often than surgeons and obstetricians, it might be in part because the former have more time to build a meaningful relationship with the patient, whereas the latter often encounter the patient for the first time in an emergency. Though it provides no guarantee, a sound physician-patient relationship is a powerful antidote to frivolous lawsuits.</p><p>Photo (W.
