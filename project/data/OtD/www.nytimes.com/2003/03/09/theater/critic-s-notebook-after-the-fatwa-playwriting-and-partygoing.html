                    <p>IF anyone deserves a break, it's a guy who's had a fatwa on his head.</p><p>But when Salman Rushdie's adaptation of his great novel ''Midnight's Children'' arrived on the London stage in January, it was clear that any lingering sympathy from that old death sentence the Ayatollah Khomeini put on him had evaporated, at least in England. The reviews ranged from respectfully disappointed to dismissive, and were followed by a deluge of snarky tabloid stories that said his relationship with the glamorous model Padma Lakshmi had ended, that he had said she was not ''intellectually challenging'' enough, and that he was in mad, unrequited pursuit of the trendy young actress Sophie Dahl.</p><p>''The tabloidization of my life has been a very ugly thing,'' Mr. Rushdie said recently, back home in New York after the London opening. He called the stories about his romantic life ''an amazing tabloid fantasy,'' discussed the eternal theme of ''Midnight's Children'' -- ''the collision of the individual and history,'' as he put it -- and the mix of high art, political-historical forces and the culture of celebrity that is his life today.</p><p>And he looked optimistically to his play's imminent arrival in the United States. The Royal Shakespeare Company will bring its London production to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor this week and, sponsored by Columbia University, to the Apollo Theater in Harlem later this month. Together, the universities threw more than $2 million at the R.S.C. to help commission the play, whose American productions will have only minimal staging changes from  the one I saw at the Barbican Center in London. As a theater piece, ''Midnight's Children'' is ambitious, intelligent but artistically misbegotten, with a spare, stylized approach that can't begin to mirror the Scheherazade-like magic of the novel. It's easy to see why the play left the kindest English critics cold; the meanest called it ''a dodo.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>In any version, ''Midnight's Children'' is the extravagant story of a man born at the exact moment of India's independence from England, at the stroke of midnight on Aug. 15, 1947, whose life comes to embody his country's fraught recent history. (Mr. Rushdie, now 55, was born two months before his fictional hero.) At the center of both novel and play is ''the big subject that never goes away,'' Mr. Rushdie said. ''Are we the masters of our times or the victims? To what extent are we in control of our lives?''</p><p>When the novel appeared in 1981, no one could have guessed how deeply those questions would penetrate his own experience.</p><p>In a room filled with artwork and light in his agent's Manhattan office, he looked at ease and slightly professorial with his glasses and beard, yet sounded urbane, with the smooth eloquence of a man often interviewed. In these post-fatwa days, he said, he has an ordinary life. He doesn't need to say that it's ordinary, only compared with his years in hiding. ''I'm not the person who wrote 'Midnight's Children,' '' he said of his novel. ''I'm very proud of that kid.''</p><p>Onstage as in the novel, his hero and narrator in ''Midnight's Children'' is Saleem Sinai (pronounced SEE-nigh), a bumbling fellow with an enormous, constantly running nose, birthmarks on both sides of his face and the ability to hear in his head the voices of hundreds of other children born at that midnight hour when India became independent and Pakistan was created.</p><p>As Saleem sees it, what happens to India is directed at him and his family, and what happens in his private life has an impact on Indian history. In a story stretching back to his grandparents, he claims that the real purpose of the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 was ''the elimination of my benighted family from the face of the earth.'' (Well, it did that.) He is convinced that when Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency and rescinded civil rights in 1975, it was to destroy the midnight's children. One of the enduring novels of the 20th century, combining Dickensian detail with magical realism and political heft, the 500-page epic seemed unlikely to live in any form but its own.</p><p>But ''Midnight's Children'' was nearly a BBC miniseries before landing onstage. After the BBC bought the rights, in the late 90's, Mr. Rushdie wrote the screenplay for a five-part series that drastically streamlined the novel, ironing out its winding narrative and toning down its embroidered prose. Earlier adapters failed because they were too respectful. ''I was able to be more ruthless than everybody else,'' Mr. Rushdie said. The crew was a few weeks from starting to film in Sri Lanka when pressure from conservative Muslim politicians there caused the government to withdraw its permission, and the project fell apart.</p><p>But the published screenplay became the template that Mr. Rushdie and his co-writers -- the play's director, Tim Supple, and its dramaturge, Simon Reade -- used to shape the theatrical version, whose structure is remarkably similar.</p><p>The miniseries would have been far more realistic, though. As Mr. Rushdie said: ''Television insists on a kind of naturalism. It's very, very difficult to be surrealistic on television,'' and easier to be fantastic in film or onstage. The stylized play, he believes, ''is probably closer to the spirit of the novel.''</p>                </div>
