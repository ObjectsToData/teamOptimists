    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THE first women to become professional playwrights in the English-speaking world were canny and resourceful but above all indomitable. Aphra Behn, who made her appearance after the Puritans closed the theaters for 20 years and bawdy Charles II opened them again in 1660, went from debtor's prison to the stage. Susanna Centlivre ran away from home and disguised herself as ''Cousin Jack.'' And Elizabeth Inchbald escaped the casting couch by throwing a basin of hot water on her pursuer. Not surprisingly, she went on to become a critic.    From the Restoration to the Victorian era, these playwrights and many other ''female wits,'' as one critic called them, survived criticism, ridicule and even sabotage to become a familiar presence on the English stage. But by the beginning of the 20th century, most of the playwrights had dropped out of history.   ">

Aphra Behn, who made her appearance after the Puritans closed the theaters for 20 years and bawdy Charles II opened them again in 1660, went from debtor's prison to the stage. Susanna Centlivre ran away from home and disguised herself as ''Cousin Jack.'' And Elizabeth Inchbald escaped the casting couch by throwing a basin of hot water on her pursuer. Not surprisingly, she went on to become a critic.</p><p>From the Restoration to the Victorian era, these playwrights and many other ''female wits,'' as one critic called them, survived criticism, ridicule and even sabotage to become a familiar presence on the English stage. But by the beginning of the 20th century, most of the playwrights had dropped out of history.</p><p>Two years ago, Mallory Catlett, a dramaturge in New York, came across Centlivre and Inchbald and wondered why she had never heard of them. She decided to investigate. ''I had a day job and DSL,'' she said recently, referring to high-speed Internet access. ''I found this Web site and just went crazy.'' She discovered a fellow enthusiast in Gwynn MacDonald, artistic director of the Juggernaut Theater Company in New York, and together they hatched an ambitious plan: to lever the work of forgotten female playwrights of the 17th and 18th centuries back into the vocabulary of theater artists and the public.</p><p>Juggernaut, a small company founded in 1994 by Juilliard graduates, eventually set up a nearly yearlong free series of 20 play readings and discussions, a symposium, a poster campaign, a window display at the Drama Book Shop and a saucy but scholarly hot-pink Web site -- all under the umbrella title of ''The First 100 Years: The Professional Female Playwright.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>''The hot pink wakes people up -- because they're usually reading it at 3 in the morning,'' said Emily King, a theater director and the Web mistress of the site: www.juggernaut-theatre.org. Except for the symposium (held last October and supported by the New York State Council on the Arts and the New York Council for the Humanities), the budget for the project has been nonexistent. But Juggernaut and its many friends aim to be as resourceful as the early female playwrights they mean to rescue.</p><p>Ms. MacDonald, 37, and Ms. Catlett, 33, have involved a wide range of companies --25 in all -- and directors in the play-reading series, from New York Theater Workshop, to the all-female Queen's Company, to the Classical Theater of Harlem and the Hispanic company Pregones (which will stage an Inchbald play on colonial prison reform).</p><p>''These are classical texts with no contemporary production history,'' Ms. MacDonald said, ''so we don't have any preconceived ideas about what the actors should look like. We're hoping that these plays will increase the opportunities for nontraditional casting of classical works.''</p><p>Through the readings, some of which are semi-staged, and discussion periods that follow, Juggernaut is also hoping to educate audiences. ''We want to introduce these artists and allow people into their worlds,'' Ms. Catlett said, adding that they have tried to keep the project politics-free, simply presenting the material and letting audiences think for themselves. ''That's one reason we do readings instead of more elaborate productions,'' Ms. MacDonald said. ''We want the text to stand out.''</p><p>Choosing among more than 60 early female dramatists, Juggernaut decided to explore five: Aphra Behn (ca. 1640-1689), Susanna Centlivre (ca. 1669-1723), Hannah Cowley (1743-1809), Elizabeth Inchbald (1753-1821) and Joanna Baillie (1762-1851). The plays cover a whole spectrum of social mores and styles: the first two writers are identified with the bawdy Restoration stage, while the next two belong to the more sexually conservative era of the later 18th century. The last, Joanna Baillie, occupies a category all her own: a tragedian, she was perhaps the most experimental and was known as a ''closet'' dramatist -- one who is for the most part read (in one's closet), rather than played.</p><p>''We tried to choose a diversity of voices and styles -- Gothic dramas, melodramas and farces,'' Ms. MacDonald said. ''With the exception of Baillie, the women mostly wrote comedies -- comedies of manners, usually centered around couples who ought to be together but are not, for some reason.'' They are ultimately brought together, she said, through comedic contrivances that often take conventional forms. Many of the playwrights twist convention to their own purposes, however, using it as a platform to oppose restrictions society placed on women's freedom to choose for themselves.</p><p>''As playwrights,'' Ms. MacDonald said, ''these women spoke directly to the audience. Usually in the prologues to their plays they took on the questions: Why shouldn't a woman be able to write as well as a man? Why should work by a woman be devalued or dismissed?''</p><p>With the exception of Baillie, each of these dramatists could expect to see a play she had written appear on the stage. Behn had more plays produced than any other playwright of her time -- with the exception of John Dryden. Centlivre's popularity was probably the most long-lived: ''The Busy Body'' (1709) was performed more than 450 times before the end of the 18th century, and went on to become part of standard repertory in the 19th.</p>                </div>
