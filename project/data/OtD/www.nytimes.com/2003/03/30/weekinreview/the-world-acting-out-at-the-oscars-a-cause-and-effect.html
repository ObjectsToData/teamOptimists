But Mr. Moore's outburst against President Bush and the war on Iraq was less than shocking, and not just because his reputation for outspokenness had preceded him: by now, people expect political speechifying by people clutching golden statuettes (or handing them out).     It was not always so. From 1927, when the Academy Awards began, even through the 1960's, Oscar winners usually spent their podium time thanking other Hollywood big shots, and left politics to find its own spotlight. But something changed in the 1970's, when controversies began regularly showing up at the ceremony, along with the stars and gossip columnists.   ">

                    <p>I'm representing Marlon Brando, who very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award [because of] the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry. The motion picture community as much as anyone has been responsible for degrading the Indian.</p><p>A woman in traditional Indian dress who identified herself as Sacheen Littlefeather, accepting Mr. Brando's best actor award for ''The Godfather.'' It later emerged she was an actress named Maria Cruz.</p><p>I don't know if I should present this award on behalf of all the cowboys shot in John Wayne westerns over the years.</p><p>Clint Eastwood, later in the broadcast, who was presenting the best picture award, which went to ''The Godfather.''</p><p>1975</p><p>It is ironic that we're here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated. I will now read a short wire I have been asked to read by the Vietnamese people [from the Vietcong delegation to the Paris peace talks]. ''Please transmit to all our friends in America our recognition of all that they have done on behalf of peace. . . . These actions serve the legitimate interests of the American people and the Vietnamese people. Greetings of friendship to all the American people.</p><p>Bert Schneider, a producer who was collecting his Oscar for best documentary feature, for the antiwar film ''Hearts and Minds.''</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, to deviate for one second. I've been asked by the academy to make the following statement regarding a statement that was made by a winner. ''We are not responsible for any political references made on the program, and we are sorry they had to take place this evening.''</p><p>Frank Sinatra, reading a statement hastily written by Bob Hope. They were hosts of the ceremony.</p><p>1978</p><p>I think you should be very proud that in the last few weeks you've stood firm, and you have refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums whose behavior is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression.</p><p>Vanessa Redgrave, a supporter of Palestinian causes, after winning the best supporting actress award for her role in ''Julia.''</p><p>I would like to say that I'm sick and tired of people exploiting the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal propaganda. A simple thank you would have sufficed.</p><p>Paddy Chayevsky, the screenwriter, responding to Ms. Redgrave, before presenting the best screenplay award.</p><p>1979</p><p>Over 14 million people are deaf. They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them.</p><p>Jane Fonda, explaining her use of sign language, after winning best actress for ''Coming Home.''</p><p>1981</p><p>The president has asked for severe cuts in aid to the arts and the humanities. It's Reagan's strongest attack on the arts since he signed with Warner Brothers.</p><p>Johnny Carson, the host, reacting to a taped message from President Ronald Reagan, then in the hospital recovering from an assassination attempt.</p><p>1987</p><p>I think that through this award, you are really acknowledging the Vietnam veteran. And I think that what you are saying is that for the first time, you really understand what happened over there. And I think what you're saying is that it should never, ever in our lifetimes happen again.</p><p>Oliver Stone, accepting the best director award for ''Platoon.''</p><p>1993</p><p>We'd like to call attention to 266 Haitians that are being held in Guant&aacute;namo Bay by the United States government. Their crime: testing positive to the H.I.V. virus.</p><p>Tim Robbins, who, with Susan Sarandon, was introducing a segment on film editing.</p><p>I was wondering if something miraculous and really kind of movielike could happen here, where we could all kind of send love and truth and a kind of sanity to Deng Xiaoping now in Beijing that he will take his troops and take the Chinese army away from Tibet and allow these people to live as free independent people again. Send this thought out. Send this thought out.</p><p>Richard Gere, announcing the winner for best art direction.</p><p>2000</p><p>I want to thank the academy for this honor to a film on the abortion subject and Miramax for having the courage to make this movie in the first place. . . . And everyone at Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Rights [Action] League.''</p><p>John Irving, best adapted screenplay winner for ''The Cider House Rules,'' which had been attacked by anti-abortion groups.</p><p>2003</p><p>We live in a time with fictitious election results that elect fictitious presidents. We live in a time when we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.</p><p>Michael Moore, claiming his best documentary Oscar for ''Bowling for Columbine.''</p><p>Photos: At the 1973 Oscars, Marlon Brando's stand-in, top, lamented the treatment of Indians. Later, Clint Eastwood, with the producer Albert S. Ruddy, took up the cowboys' cause. (Copyright AMPAS); (Associated Press)</p>                </div>
