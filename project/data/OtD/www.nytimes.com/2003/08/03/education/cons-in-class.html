                    <p>The men raise their hands. It's life, one says. ''Woman kills husband, husband kills wife -- everyday life.''</p><p>''Marriages explode because of economic problems,'' says another.</p><p>''Men and women go into marriage for different reasons,'' says a third.</p><p>''So the relationship between the sexes has not changed very much,'' Dr. Murray proffers. The conversation strikes a chord, and the men start talking about their own lives. This happens a lot, she says. ''The tenor of the class, the openness, those are constants. Once we were talking about the opinions the world has of you versus your own identity. The labels 'black men,' 'prisoner' -- what does this mean to your own sense of self? Literature is about how conflict changes people. Here are real-life people dealing with real-life conflicts.''</p><p>Educating prisoners is something Dr. Murray believes in strongly. ''I've always had sympathies for people who make the wrong choices,'' she says. A former dean of students at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., she wrote her graduate school dissertation on prison education and recidivism rates. She rarely asks her students what crime they committed, and she has never felt unsafe. ''It's a maturity thing,'' she says. ''Nobody's 18. They've been in long enough and they understand that education is the key. Part of their motivation is because most of them are getting out.''</p><p>She continues: ''One of the best responses I've heard for why men and women in prisons should study philosophy was: 'For the same reason people do it at Harvard.' No matter where you are, it's the same. Like what happened to Malcolm X -- he copied the dictionary, he loved words. There's power in being an educated man who can use words.''</p><p>Inmate number 86A348, Juan Roldan, also loves words. But he didn't know that until he went to prison and started studying.</p><p>Mr. Roldan, 40, has spent 17 years behind bars and has almost eight more to go before he's eligible for parole. His sentence is big -- 25 to life for robbing and murdering a cabdriver in the Bronx. At 6 feet 2 and 230 pounds, Mr. Roldan looks as if he spends a lot of time working out, and he does. The rest of the day he sweeps and mops, for which he gets $5 every two weeks, or studies. He rarely watches television.</p><p>Mr. Roldan grew up on the Lower East Side long before it was fashionable, and then moved in with his father in Camden, N.J. After graduating from high school he considered joining the Marines but stayed behind for a girl. He took menial jobs, ran with a rough crowd and got into drugs. He won't give specifics about his crime. He was locked up at the Greenhaven Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Stormville, N.Y., for 14 years. There, he participated in a range of therapeutic programs. One day, in transactional analysis, the teacher asked him to make a list of all the pros and cons in his life.</p><p>Here were the pros: He had had money, two cars and an apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He had a high school diploma. He was assertive, intelligent, strong. Then the cons: ''I'm in prison. I used drugs. I've got no car, no wife, no apartment. The only thing left was the high school diploma. Reality smacked me in the face. I cried, 'I ruined my life.' The cons got bigger: I'm overly assertive, overly aggressive. I need to be humble. I'm in prison. That's when I decided to do my best here.''</p><p>He began by taking classes. Greenhaven offered a degree program through Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., but, after Mr. Roldan had earned 84 credits, President Bill Clinton signed legislation in 1994 making convicted felons ineligible for Pell grants, the federal tuition assistance program for low-income students. At the time, nearly 27,000 inmates were paying for college with the grants, costing the government $35 million annually. Most states, including New York, withdrew financial aid for prison education, and more than 350 programs shut down nationwide.</p>                </div>
