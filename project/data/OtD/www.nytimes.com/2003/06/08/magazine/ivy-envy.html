    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="A street-level marquee on the mottled limestone facade of a onetime hat factory just east of Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, advertises the current attractions at the Bottom Line cabaret. Bohemian spirits have congregated at the nightclub since 1974, when the opening-night party drew Mick Jagger, Carly Simon and Janis Ian. In those days, a college kid might have been presumed to be more enthralled with folk rock than with finance. No longer. Now, several flights up, in a warren of cramped offices, the bottom line is disputed in ways that would spin the heads and glaze the eyes of aged hippies. There, in the halls of New York University's department of economics, a group of data-crunching devotees of things macro and micro have become leading characters in a drama of academic empire building -- and brand building -- that has captivated aficionados of the sporting world of higher-octane higher education. Last August, N.Y.U. served notice of its ''white-hot ambitions,'' in the words of Richard Foley, the school's dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, by announcing its Steinbrenner-like acquisition of eight new economists and its intention to pursue another dozen or 15 over the next few years. N.Y.U.'s higher-ups are betting on economics, the abstruse and insular discipline that Thomas Carlyle dubbed ''the dismal science,'' to set the tone for something the school's new president, John Sexton, a man temperamentally incapable of understatement, calls ''a new paradigm for the American university.''    Peter Diamond, a professor of economics at M.I.T. and president of the 18,000-member American Economic Association, cannot recall an academic hiring spree of such dimensions in the field -- let alone one that unfolded in sorrowful budgetary times for American universities. N.Y.U.'s new faculty members were lured from the World Bank, the London School of Economics, the University of Michigan and Boston University, among other places. (In addition, N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, which has its own economics department, grabbed Adam Brandenburger, a star theorist, from Harvard, and Niall Ferguson, a leading historian of economics, from Oxford.) The most stunning coup, by far, was N.Y.U.'s hiring of Thomas Sargent, who is among a handful of most-revered economists living, and who is widely regarded as a leading contender for an eventual Nobel Prize. Sargent turned down offers from the University of Chicago and M.I.T. -- both solidly ensconced among the top five economics programs in the world -- and came to N.Y.U. from Stanford, which, along with Harvard and Princeton, typically rounds out most estimates of the field's elite. In ballpark terms, N.Y.U.'s moves had the appearance of a solid small-market team -- the St. Louis Cardinals, say -- beefing up its roster to make a run at the pennant by adding a core of solid role players and a Hall of Fame pitcher in the prime of his career. ''The people N.Y.U. is getting are terrific,'' admits Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago. ''It's not Top 5 yet, but I'd say it's Top 10. We wanted Sargent, so when they hired him, it certainly got our attention.'' According to Michael Kremer, a development economist at Harvard: ''What N.Y.U. has done is not something that happens every year. I think Harvard had better stay on its toes.''   ">

	data-description="A street-level marquee on the mottled limestone facade of a onetime hat factory just east of Washington Square Park, in Greenwich Village, advertises the current attractions at the Bottom Line cabaret. Bohemian spirits have congregated at the nightclub since 1974, when the opening-night party drew Mick Jagger, Carly Simon and Janis Ian. In those days, a college kid might have been presumed to be more enthralled with folk rock than with finance. No longer. Now, several flights up, in a warren of cramped offices, the bottom line is disputed in ways that would spin the heads and glaze the eyes of aged hippies. There, in the halls of New York University's department of economics, a group of data-crunching devotees of things macro and micro have become leading characters in a drama of academic empire building -- and brand building -- that has captivated aficionados of the sporting world of higher-octane higher education. Last August, N.Y.U. served notice of its ''white-hot ambitions,'' in the words of Richard Foley, the school's dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, by announcing its Steinbrenner-like acquisition of eight new economists and its intention to pursue another dozen or 15 over the next few years. N.Y.U.'s higher-ups are betting on economics, the abstruse and insular discipline that Thomas Carlyle dubbed ''the dismal science,'' to set the tone for something the school's new president, John Sexton, a man temperamentally incapable of understatement, calls ''a new paradigm for the American university.''    Peter Diamond, a professor of economics at M.I.T. and president of the 18,000-member American Economic Association, cannot recall an academic hiring spree of such dimensions in the field -- let alone one that unfolded in sorrowful budgetary times for American universities. N.Y.U.'s new faculty members were lured from the World Bank, the London School of Economics, the University of Michigan and Boston University, among other places. (In addition, N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, which has its own economics department, grabbed Adam Brandenburger, a star theorist, from Harvard, and Niall Ferguson, a leading historian of economics, from Oxford.) The most stunning coup, by far, was N.Y.U.'s hiring of Thomas Sargent, who is among a handful of most-revered economists living, and who is widely regarded as a leading contender for an eventual Nobel Prize. Sargent turned down offers from the University of Chicago and M.I.T. -- both solidly ensconced among the top five economics programs in the world -- and came to N.Y.U. from Stanford, which, along with Harvard and Princeton, typically rounds out most estimates of the field's elite. In ballpark terms, N.Y.U.'s moves had the appearance of a solid small-market team -- the St. Louis Cardinals, say -- beefing up its roster to make a run at the pennant by adding a core of solid role players and a Hall of Fame pitcher in the prime of his career. ''The people N.Y.U. is getting are terrific,'' admits Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago. ''It's not Top 5 yet, but I'd say it's Top 10. We wanted Sargent, so when they hired him, it certainly got our attention.'' According to Michael Kremer, a development economist at Harvard: ''What N.Y.U. has done is not something that happens every year. I think Harvard had better stay on its toes.''   "></div>

According to Michael Kremer, a development economist at Harvard: ''What N.Y.U. has done is not something that happens every year. I think Harvard had better stay on its toes.''</p><p>N.Y.U.'s economics department has come a long way since the 70's, when a university chancellor called the program the worst in the country. Around that time, a department chairman was fired for financial improprieties. ''It was the Dark Ages,'' says Andrew Schotter, 55, who joined the department 27 years ago. Desperate to raise its profile, the department hired a quartet of famous but elderly economists, including 1973 Nobel laureate Wassily Leontief, who was at Harvard. ''Some of these people were thinking, O.K., I'm at the end of my career, I'll move to New York and go to the opera,'' says another longtime faculty member. During Schotter's eight years as department chairman, however, the department ''decided to change the norms that fostered mediocrity.'' And by 1998, a study published in The Journal of Economic Perspectives, one of the top professional publications, had ranked N.Y.U.'s economics program sixth in the country for the quality of faculty research. Indeed, after years of bolstering its ranks with promising young economists, N.Y.U. had begun encountering a problem well known to second-tier sports franchises: as its personnel matured, they became bait for better-established schools. In 1999, his first year as chairman of the department, Douglas Gale remembers: ''We had 30 people, and 10 of them had offers from other schools; some of them had multiple offers. We lost people to Princeton, Yale, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, University of Pennsylvania.'' N.Y.U. pays its valued faculty well -- new entry-level professors in economics earn around $80,000, and the top senior faculty members make more than $200,000 -- and the school was prepared to match the salary offers of outside bidders. The problem of retaining faculty was not strictly monetary, though. N.Y.U. could simply not vie with the top schools on the basis of what Mark Gertler, the current chairman of the economics department, refers to as the mother-in-law effect -- ''not just how good the school might be, but what a mother-in-law will think.''</p>                </div>
