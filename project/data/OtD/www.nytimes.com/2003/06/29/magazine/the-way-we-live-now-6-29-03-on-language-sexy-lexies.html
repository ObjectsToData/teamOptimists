Less noncy is funplex, ''an entertainment complex that includes facilities for various sports and games and often restaurants.'' Genetically modified chow is in there as Frankenfood, still capitalized in honor of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the ghost of Mary Shelley will be pleased to learn. Waitrons (nope; that overly nonsexist term never made it) will be happy to see barista, ''a person who makes and serves coffee (as espresso) to the public.''

That dictionary, first reference of The New York Times and not for dummies, is updated annually. ''This year's new words,'' Mike Agnes, its editor in chief, informs me, ''will include crunch, as in the gym move, and firewall, in its computer sense. We've added every schoolchild's favorite dinosaur, the velociraptor. And here's a word you'll like: kleptocracy, 'a government characterized by the theft or appropriation of its country's natural resources or finances.''' Boytoy, though used in the early 1980's from a self-description on Madonna's belt, is now in use with its sex changed to ''an attractive man regarded as being a readily compliant companion or sex partner.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Best lexical news of all to word lovers is the salvation of the Historical Dictionary of American Slang. The first two volumes of this projected tetralogy (that's Standard English for four volumes) were published by Random House and opened a window on America's cultural heritage. The ambitious project, brainchild of Jonathan Lighter at the University of Tennessee, was a godsend to all of us in the language dodge. But Random House, which is not a philanthropy, saw no profit in finishing it. We panicked; would slang scholarship stop dead at the letter O?</p><p>The National Endowment for the Humanities popped with a grant of $325,000 over two years to keep Lighter slaving away like a modern-day Sir James Murray, and Oxford University Press picked up the challenge. The Brits, just as they did in Iraq, came through for the U.S.</p><p>''The N.E.H. grant helps subvent it,'' reports Casper Grathwohl, reference editor at Oxford, ''and we're now working out the contract with Random House.'' (The verb subvent, ''to come to the help of,'' is listed as ''obsolete, rare'' in the Oxford English Dictionary, but it defines the noun subvention as ''a grant from government . . . in support of an enterprise of public importance,'' which this nearly abandoned history surely is.) Jesse Sheidlower, who was Lighter's editor at Random House, is now principal North American editor of the O.E.D. and will work with the great lexicographer again.</p><p>''We want to build a whole online slang project with this at its core,'' Grathwohl says, ''a slang resource center and living language project.'' He envisions a ''slang watch'' and a yearbook of ''the best American slang of 2004, that sort of thing. By being able to finish this work, Oxford will play a pivotal role in documenting the way Americans speak.'' Why? The British lexie subvented me easily: ''Slang is the sexiest part of a language.''</p><p>Not all etymology of American slang and local dialect has been placed in British hands. The majestic, delicious Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), headquartered at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and pioneered by the late Fred Cassidy, is now in its fifth of six volumes. The Mellon Foundation led the way, and the Horace Goldsmith Foundation has been helping finance this work, and I've been shamelessly wheedling readers for its support in this space, but it's been a financial struggle to get past the letters Sk. Now the Harvard University Press has stepped in, and the elite East will help preserve the linguistic history of the hinterland's hoagies, heroes and subs.</p><p>''It's amazing that there is so little overlap,'' Lighter observes in wonderment, ''between the corpus of my slang work and DARE's. It shows the huge size of the nonstandard vocabulary.''</p><p>He's up to the letter S. What histories lie there? ''Scam will be in there, in the sense of 'con game.' Snorter is a good one: an old seafaring term for a heavy gale, usually off Cape Horn. Scope out -- 'to look at,' synonymous with 'to peep something out.' Here's another good one: swamp angel, a term used in the Deep South in the 19th century that means 'mosquito.' I don't know if The Times will let you write about this, but there'll be an entry for smart-ass as well.''</p><p>I explained to my lexical brother that The Times permits me to examine words that would otherwise be banned from its pages on grounds of good taste if the purpose is scholarly or if the quoted use is germane. Although the common slang term for what President Reagan famously called keister is still properly frowned on by stylists at my newspaper, it is permissible to quote the Charles Dickens character Mr. Bumble's ''The law is a ass'' (remembering not to change the dialectic a to an). Perhaps, in his etymology of smart-ass, Lighter will discover how the second part of that compound noun and adjective turned away from -aleck.</p><p>Anyone who derogates the philology of slang, as exemplified in Harvard Press's DARE, in Oxford Press's Historical Dictionary of American Slang, in some of our new dictionaries -- or who tries to bowdlerize these final paragraphs -- should feel free to consult those authorities for a colorful, widely understood adjective to describe such hypersensitivity.</p>                </div>
