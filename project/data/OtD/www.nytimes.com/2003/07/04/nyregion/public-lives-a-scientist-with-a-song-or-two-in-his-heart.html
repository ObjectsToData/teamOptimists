''I play decently. My goal is to get good enough to play with a group and not embarrass myself.''</p><p>Dr. Botstein, who this week began work as the director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, hardly needs the humiliation of trying to master a new instrument, especially given that his brother, Leon, is not only the president of Bard College but also the conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra. It was his brother, not he, who went to the High School of Music and Art in New York, while he was directed toward science.</p><p>''It was the right choice,'' he said, ''but the music and art high school is where I wanted to go at the time.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Music is not unrelated to science. It is, rather, important for building the mental dexterity and agility required of great scientists. And Dr. Botstein's passions, seemingly distinct, have always been intertwined. He sang in the chorus and glee club as a student at Harvard and made sure his two children were musically trained.</p><p>''There is an orderliness and mental discipline in music as in science,'' he said. ''You need to develop an intuitive grasp of what things should look and sound like. This intuition is the same in music as it is in biology. There is a great misunderstanding in education that music and art are optional. They are no more optional than exercise.''</p><p>The passionate defense of the outer wing of the humanities from Dr. Botstein, who is finding his way around Princeton's stunning new Carl Icahn Laboratory, is a vestige of the prewar European intellectual tradition handed down by his parents, a tradition that is vanishing in an age of specializations and a love of technological efficiency. It is also a vestige of a life that often had no certainties or stability.</p><p>Dr. Botstein was born in Zurich during World War II. His Polish parents, both doctors, had been studying medicine there when the Nazis overran Poland. They stayed in Switzerland while many in their family died in the Holocaust. A few years after the war they came to New York. Dr. Botstein, then 7, along with his brother and sister, moved into a three-room apartment as his parents struggled to pass exams and establish themselves in the medical profession. It was not until he was a teenager that his parents began to earn comfortable salaries.</p><p>''I did everything possible to fit in,'' he said. ''I lost my German accent. I joined the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts. I was the pioneer in the family in all things American.''</p><p>But his parents did not give in to all things American. Work, especially for those who had lost everything, was a serious and central part of life. The three children were pushed hard and, if not pressured, then strongly encouraged to become doctors. Dr. Botstein's sister, Dr. Eva Griepp, obliged, becoming a cardiologist.</p><p>''I became a scientist,'' he said, ''so this was O.K. But there were long discussions about my brother becoming a musician. There were two priorities, education and finding a profession that could contribute to society. This, and the fact that one's word was one's bond.''</p><p>Dr. Botstein has a daughter, Ruth, from a first marriage who is a lawyer in Alaska, and an accomplished singer. And he has a son, Sam, 10, who he said was a fine trumpet player. His wife, Renee Fitts, is a photographer.</p><p>He has a weakness for Charlie Chan movies. He spoke with animation about a scene in one film when a character gives Charlie Chan his theory on the case.</p><p>''Theory like mist on eyeglasses, obscures vision,'' he said, mimicking the actor.</p><p>''It is all about theory versus reality,'' he said. ''There are lots of illusions about how the world works.''</p><p>HE is not interested in illusions. His work as a cell biologist has centered on genetics and the use of genetic methods to understand biological functions. He helped lead the revolution in modern human genetics, developing methods for mapping of the human genome and for mapping genes that cause disease.</p><p>''There are about 30,000 different genes in a living organism,'' he said. ''The human brain is not capable of manipulating 30,000 of anything. This is why biologists must today work with computer scientists.''</p><p>The Icahn Laboratory is a monument to the new world, one that seems to have left rows of bookshelves and Bach cantatas behind. Designed by Rafael Vi&ntilde;oly, it has a curved glass facade. It is about light-filled atriums and a metallic modern sculpture that is large enough to contain a conference room. The laboratories will permit molecular biologists to work alongside physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists in the new integral research that is coming to characterize science. It is clean and neat and strangely insubstantial.</p><p>But its design did nothing one afternoon to dampen Dr. Botstein's other passion. He sat at his computer scanning the screen as he struggled to pull up some information. It was not coming, and so he began not to speak his commands to his computer but sing them.</p><p>Photo: DAVID BOTSTEIN (Norman Y.
