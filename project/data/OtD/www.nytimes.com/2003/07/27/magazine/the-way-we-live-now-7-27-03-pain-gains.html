    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In the early mornings, when I head out to work, I often see the same middle-aged jogger go by, fussing with his stopwatch. Though his pace is rapid, it is also shuddering, like a cart with a wobbly wheel. I picture bone grinding on bone with no cartilage left to intervene. And yet it is not pain that shows on his face but pleasure. I speculate about this man even as I envy him. Exercise for him is its own reward. It is life affirming and it is his addiction.    My addiction is tennis. In summer I may hobble around home and office, but on the court, once I hear the opening pop of a new can of balls, pain is forgotten, and I lunge and sprint with abandon. My game peaked 10 years ago and then came down to a steady club level. Since then, the biggest change is in the time it takes to recover from my on-court exertions. There was a week not long ago, for example, when I dreaded shaking hands because my elbow hurt, I limped from Achilles tendinitis, lying flat was preferable to sitting because my back ached and the Advil was taking its toll on my stomach. And yet, when my partner called to see if I would play, I couldn't get out the door fast enough. I felt comforted that even President Bush, a committed exerciser, had complained just that month of aching knees. Last month, it was revealed he had torn his calf muscle in April.  ">

Though his pace is rapid, it is also shuddering, like a cart with a wobbly wheel. I picture bone grinding on bone with no cartilage left to intervene. And yet it is not pain that shows on his face but pleasure. I speculate about this man even as I envy him. Exercise for him is its own reward. It is life affirming and it is his addiction.    My addiction is tennis. In summer I may hobble around home and office, but on the court, once I hear the opening pop of a new can of balls, pain is forgotten, and I lunge and sprint with abandon. My game peaked 10 years ago and then came down to a steady club level. Since then, the biggest change is in the time it takes to recover from my on-court exertions. There was a week not long ago, for example, when I dreaded shaking hands because my elbow hurt, I limped from Achilles tendinitis, lying flat was preferable to sitting because my back ached and the Advil was taking its toll on my stomach. And yet, when my partner called to see if I would play, I couldn't get out the door fast enough. I felt comforted that even President Bush, a committed exerciser, had complained just that month of aching knees. Last month, it was revealed he had torn his calf muscle in April.  "></div>

Last month, it was revealed he had torn his calf muscle in April.</p><p>He is no exception. On the courts, I see players his age, or mine (upper 40's), wearing strange patellar bands or air-filled forearm straps or thigh wraps or wrist braces, not to mention magnets parked over various body sites. No doubt at home they have gel packs cooling in the freezer and supersize bottles of Motrin. All for good health!</p><p>As a nation, our waistlines are expanding. Missives regarding the salutary effects of exercise on lipids, on blood pressure, on risk for heart disease and diabetes bombard us from all sides. But when we exercise, moderation does not come easily to our society. If you are inclined to cycle, a pedal pusher won't do; a feather-light bike and every last accessory is de rigueur. The billions we Americans spend on just the right shoes for our particular sport is a measure of serious intent. What is tricky is finding the sport or exercise we can sustain. So many yard sales feature newish exercise bikes, treadmills, weight benches and ski machines all destined to go from one dusty garage to another. If good intention were the measure of health, we would be a very healthy nation. It is only when exercise becomes its own reward, a compulsion, that it sticks. Regular exercise seems to have taken the highest place in the pantheon of modern American virtues.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mass media and Madison Avenue have driven us to identify closely with professional athletes, particularly athletes who defy the age limits of their sport, like Andre Agassi or Martina Navratilova, or who overcome major medical obstacles. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a former Mr. Universe, had a heart valve replaced, and in his 50's the Terminator remains a formidable figure, a living invitation for us all to pump it up.</p><p>It is an invitation many have accepted. I see more people who were never jocks in school and who are no longer in the prime of youth but who have recently transformed themselves into muscle-bound hulks. We live in an age when machines, robots and microchips have retooled work, not only making our manual skills redundant but also shaming us at many cognitive tasks. If we buff and shape our bodies and if we sport six-pack abs and arms the size of thighs, perhaps it is in reaction to this fear of obsolescence, to feel as if we can assert control when we want. Though our pumped-up muscles are the result of tremendous work performed with weights in air-conditioned gyms, they do no useful work. We get chiseled and ripped, we chow down and beef up, all so that the body can serve as its own billboard and so that we reassure ourselves in the mirror that the human machine is still supreme.</p><p>One thing machines cannot do, but humans can, is take personal risks. More people seem to be pursuing extreme sports, pushing themselves to new and dangerous levels. Triathlons, endurance races, mountain climbs, sky dives, Antarctic treks -- the risk list goes on. Success is now defined by our personal best. Joshua Cooper Ramo, author of ''No Visible Horizon,'' is an extreme flyer -- a sport that by his estimate kills 1 in 30 of its participants. Ramo describes extreme flying as ''a conversation with myself about what I am capable of.''</p><p>And what about those of us whose pastimes are more earthbound and ordinary? We play hard, long and unwisely at times, often to the point of injury. Like bodybuilders, we care about how we look, but even more we care about how playing makes us feel. Time vanishes in an activity that takes us beyond cognition, takes us into the zone, a transcendent place no machine will ever enter. The universe is condensed in our play.</p><p>How are we to view the pain that follows later? I admit there is something self-indulgent and almost narcissistic in the way I apply the ice packs or in the way I massage my inflamed tendons or sink into a hot tub. Pain makes me aware of my body in a way that pain's absence never does -- in that sense pain is a gift Arnold's Terminator will never know. Pain reminds me to treat the instrument better, to tape it, stretch it and cushion it. This pain from sport is delicious, even as it is terrible. Pain allows entry into its own culture where you compare notes on a message board and where you receive advice about heel lifts, magnets, even the faith healer and the witch doctor who made tennis champion Yannick Noah's pain vanish. We wish for the pain to be gone and work hard to get rid of it. When it has disappeared, however, we are almost nostalgic for its companionship. This is the paradoxical pain of exercise: pain that becomes the emblem of the new virtue.</p><p>Photo (Chip Simons; Getty Images)    Chart: ''OUCH''     Participants   Injuries   Injuries per 100 participants  Football (Tackle)   5,783   1,084   18.8  Ice Hockey   2,612   415   15.9  Boxing   908   116   12.7  Martial Arts   5,996   610   10.2  Soccer   17,641   1,634   9.3  Cheerleading   3,596   323   9.0  Basketball   36,584   2,783   7.6  Wrestling   2,026   133   6.5  Softball   16,587   1,063   6.4  Baseball   10,402   602   5.8  Running/Jogging   35,866   1,654   4.6  Skateboarding   12,997   399   3.1  Mountain Biking   6,719   201   3.0  Snowboarding   7,691   218   2.8  Skiing (Downhill)   14,249   289   2.0     Selected U.S. sports injuries in 2002, from American Sports Data, Inc.  </p>                </div>
