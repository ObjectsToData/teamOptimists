    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In May 1997, the Arts and Sciences Council at Duke University rejected a proposal to change how grade point averages were computed. The new formula accounted for variations in the grading policies of different professors and departments. For instance, A's awarded by professors who gave only A's would count less than A's from professors who also handed out B's and C's.    Not surprisingly, the proposal, which was mine, proved to be quite controversial. Easy graders objected to the implication that their A's were somehow less valuable than the A's awarded by others. Of the 61 council members, 19 voted against the proposal (except for one, they were all humanities professors), while 14 voted in favor (all science and math). I suspect the idea would have fared better if the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament had not started that afternoon -- humanities professors are not into Duke basketball the way science professors are.

The new formula accounted for variations in the grading policies of different professors and departments. For instance, A's awarded by professors who gave only A's would count less than A's from professors who also handed out B's and C's.    Not surprisingly, the proposal, which was mine, proved to be quite controversial. Easy graders objected to the implication that their A's were somehow less valuable than the A's awarded by others. Of the 61 council members, 19 voted against the proposal (except for one, they were all humanities professors), while 14 voted in favor (all science and math). I suspect the idea would have fared better if the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament had not started that afternoon -- humanities professors are not into Duke basketball the way science professors are.

More than 45 percent of Duke undergraduate grades at the time were A's of one flavor or another, and fewer than 15 percent were C-plus or lower. Five years later, little has changed at Duke or elsewhere. Nearly every university in the country has experienced a similar trend. In fact, Duke is barely keeping pace with its peers.</p><p>This academic year the country was shocked -- shocked! -- over the revelation that half of all undergraduate grades at Harvard are A or A-minus, and that 91 percent of last June's graduates walked off with Latin honors. Some attribute the inflationary trend to a degradation of academic standards -- ''a collapse in critical judgment'' among humanities faculty, as Harry R. Lewis, the dean of Harvard College, told The Boston Globe. Others invoke the more popular explanation that grade inflation is the byproduct of rapidly improving student bodies and a heightened emphasis on undergraduate teaching, and that higher grades have no effect on post-secondary education as a whole.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In a two-semester experiment in 1998-99, several colleagues from Duke's Committee on Grades joined me in investigating these arguments, conducting an online study with student course evaluations. Among other issues, we examined the influence of grades on evaluations (or, as some assert, can students judge teaching independently of how they do in a course?) and on which courses students enroll in (or are they too high-minded to let a potentially low grade affect their decision?).</p><p>About 1,900 students participated, providing more than 11,500 complete responses to a 38-item evaluation of courses they were either currently enrolled in or had taken the previous semester. Freshmen completed evaluations for fall courses twice, before receiving a final grade and after, allowing us to measure the effects their grades had on how they evaluated the teacher.</p><p>The results were startling. Freshmen expecting an A-minus were 20 to 30 percent more likely to provide a favorable review than those expecting a B, who were 20 to 30 percent more likely than those expecting a C-plus, and so on. After the course was over, students changed their assessments: on average, those who did not get the grade they had anticipated lowered their evaluation, and those with higher marks gave more favorable evaluations. Because the same students were rating the same instructors, teaching could not account for the change of heart. Something else was at play.</p><p>Lenient graders tend to support one theory for these findings: students with good teachers learn more, earn higher grades and, appreciating a job well done, rate the course more highly. This is good news for pedagogy, if true. But tough graders tend to side with two other interpretations: in what has become known as the grade attribution theory, students attribute success to themselves and failure to others, blaming the instructor for low marks. In the so-called leniency theory, students simply reward teachers who reward them (not because they're good teachers). In both cases, students deliver less favorable evaluations to hard graders.</p><p>Our experiment, building on previous grading research, offered strong evidence supporting the views held by the tough graders.</p><p>The second goal of our study was to examine the influence grading policies exert on the courses students decided to take. As an incentive for participating, students were given the opportunity to view summaries of the evaluations that were entered by other students, along with mean grades of courses taught in the past (another aspect of the experiment that didn't exactly endear us to Duke faculty). Over the course of the experiment, students looked at more than 42,000 mean grades (about four times the number of course evaluations that were inspected). Grading influence was then statistically assessed by matching the mean grades the students examined to the courses they subsequently took. The results are perhaps best illustrated through this example: in choosing between two different instructors of the same course -- one who grades at an A-minus average and another a B average -- students were twice as likely to select the A-minus instructor. Similar conclusions applied when students chose among different courses.</p>                </div>
