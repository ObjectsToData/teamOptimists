    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THE conventional wisdom these days seems to be that if you blinked, you missed this recession. Some even argue there was no recession. They say there is a new economy, in which business now adjusts much faster than it once did, partly because it has better and quicker information on which to base decisions. Others say productivity growth will keep up because of heavy investment in high technology in the late 1990's. Others suggest that the embrace of free markets has simply made the economy more efficient; keep government out.    But in fact, a closer look at the data shows that it was a typical recession by most measures, especially in terms of jobs lost. By some measures, it even lasted longer than other recessions. And the greatest irony is that it may well have been worse except for the government's reaction to the events of Sept. 11. Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy restored growth. The government apparently bailed us out.  ">

                    <p>THE conventional wisdom these days seems to be that if you blinked, you missed this recession. Some even argue there was no recession. They say there is a new economy, in which business now adjusts much faster than it once did, partly because it has better and quicker information on which to base decisions. Others say productivity growth will keep up because of heavy investment in high technology in the late 1990's. Others suggest that the embrace of free markets has simply made the economy more efficient; keep government out.</p><p>But in fact, a closer look at the data shows that it was a typical recession by most measures, especially in terms of jobs lost. By some measures, it even lasted longer than other recessions. And the greatest irony is that it may well have been worse except for the government's reaction to the events of Sept. 11. Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy restored growth. The government apparently bailed us out.</p><p>The confusion begins with our overreliance on the gross domestic product -- the annual amount of goods, services, business investment and government spending -- as the arbiter of recession. Its other side is the nation's income: wages and salaries, profits, interest and rent. But G.D.P. doesn't tell us how many people have jobs or whether they are working longer. It doesn't tell us how much was borrowed to support capital spending or consumption. But if G.D.P., discounted for inflation, falls for two quarters, we are told we are in a recession.</p><p>This time around, G.D.P. fell only briefly. Over the course of the recession, which began in March 2001 and possibly ended late this winter, G.D.P. after inflation fell only 0.34 percent, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute. The shallowest recession before this was in 1969 and 1970, when G.D.P. dipped 0.61 percent. The worst, by this measure, was the 1973-75 recession, when G.D.P. fell 3.4 percent.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But now let's look at employment. Jobs were lost at a far faster pace than the modest fall in G.D.P. suggests. According to the government's monthly payroll survey, the nation has lost about 1.4 million jobs since March 2001 -- more than in three of the six other recessions since 1960.</p><p>A better way to look at it is in percentage terms because the job market grows. Even so, the number of jobs fell 1.1 percent from March 2001 to last February. In other words, employment fell at three times the rate of the fall in G.D.P. This never happened before. In all recessions since 1973-75, employment fell about as much as G.D.P. In 1981-82, for example, jobs declined by 2.8 million, or about 3 percent, while G.D.P. fell 2.9 percent.</p><p>No wonder productivity rose this time. Productivity is nothing more than the number of hours worked divided by the output of goods and services. If the nation fires its workers much faster than its sales fall, productivity rises because hours worked for each dollar of revenue falls. What may be newest about this new economy is not information technology or free markets, but the freedom corporations have to fire at will.</p><p>Capital investment and profits also plunged. Industrial production fell proportionally more than it did in several past recessions, and the decline has lasted longer than ever before. Even the decline in employment has lasted as long as it did in most past recessions, and it has spread across as many industries.</p><p>Why did G.D.P. alone hold up? It may well have been the government reaction to Sept. 11, says Anirvan Banerji, managing editor at the Economic Cycle Research Institute. The alarming events provoked the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates sharply. As a consequence, Mr. Banerji said, auto companies could offer zero financing, and car sales drove G.D.P. up in the fourth quarter (and consumers borrowed against their homes).</p><p>At the same time, government spending rose rapidly in the battle against terrorism. Both auto sales and government spending rose enough to account alone for the 1.7 percent gain in G.D.P. in the fourth quarter, offsetting the sharp drop in capital spending.</p><p>Without the alarm set off by Sept. 11, Mr. Banerji said, it is possible that the economy might have slid into recession without provoking an adequate response from the Fed or fiscal stimulus from the White House and Congress.</p><p>What does this tell us about future growth? Some argue that with all the layoffs, business has positioned itself to improve profits and start investing again. But ''The Boom and the Bubble'' (Verso), a new book by Robert Brenner, a historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, raises some doubts. It is the best financial history of the period yet.</p><p>Mr. Brenner traces how the falling dollar from the mid-1980's to the early 1990's helped restore the profits of manufacturers by reducing export prices. He also shows how business's ability to keep wages down improved profits. With better profits, and more accommodative Federal Reserve policy, capital investment at last took off.</p><p>Even so, capital investment was soon generating a reduced return, and profitability began falling by 1997. But the rising stock market and low interest rates disguised the erosion because it allowed corporations to raise money and invest even without strong profit. Meantime, consumers also borrowed in lavish amounts.</p><p>Now the dollar is high again. Wages have risen strongly for five years. Borrowing is at record levels. The stock market, even if it stops falling, is highly unlikely to rise at the pace of the 1990's.</p><p>Does this mean we are entering a period of slow growth or are on the verge of another recession? Financial conditions are not everything. A continuing fall in computer prices and new standardized products can offset any financial obstacles.</p><p>But the financial risks are high. And neither information technology nor free markets have eliminated the business cycle. The best guess is slow growth for a long time, and another recession cannot be ruled out.</p><p>There is thus ample room for more fiscal stimulus, ideally social programs for the poor, who will spend the money. And the Fed should stay cautious about raising interest rates. We are not out of the woods yet.</p><p>Photo: Job seekers at a job fair in Manhattan in January. The impact of the recent recession on employment may be a better gauge of the slowdown than reliance on G.D.P. is.
