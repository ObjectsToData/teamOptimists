                    <p>It is tough enough to take on the job of New York City cultural affairs commissioner just as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed cuts of 15 percent to the agency's expense budget and 20 percent to its capital budget.</p><p>But Kate D. Levin also inherits a department many arts professionals describe as in need of serious reinvigoration. Even as Rudolph W. Giuliani poured an unprecedented amount of city money into cultural building projects and became known for his love of opera, the agency charged with promoting the interests of New York's arts institutions quietly but steadily diminished in size and influence amid years of budgetary ups and downs.</p><p>Since 1990, the staff of the Department of Cultural Affairs has shrunk to 33 people from 65. (It was at 47 when Mr. Giuliani took office.) The department has been receiving a declining share of money each year from the city budget, according to a recent report by the New York Foundation for the Arts, a nonprofit arts support group. Since 1988 this has cost the agency nearly $250 million in inflation-adjusted spending, the report says.</p><p>''The agency requires significant strengthening to operate more effectively as an agent, catalyst and convener for a large and complex cultural economy,'' the report, a yearlong study of the city's cultural industry, concluded.</p>                </div>

                    <p>And while the cultural affairs department right now is mostly a conduit for money from the city, arts professionals say that it has the potential to be much more, that the commissioner could lead the charge in making the case for culture as a sound economic investment for both government and the private sector.</p><p>The new commissioner ''has to figure out how she wants to articulate the role of culture in this city's life,'' said Mary Schmidt Campbell, who served as cultural affairs commissioner from 1987 to 1991. During the era of Mayor Edward I. Koch, for example, cultural affairs became a symbol that ''this city is not going to die,'' Ms. Campbell said. When crack was rampant, Ms. Campbell continued, Mayor David N. Dinkins missed an opportunity to use cultural affairs as a way to say, ''Here is the affirmative side of city life.''</p><p>Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide arts advocacy group, and others say the commissioner must argue for culture as a financial engine. This was the theory that held the greatest sway with Mr. Giuliani, as Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor who oversaw cultural affairs under Mr. Giuliani, noted. ''The mayor tended to look at the arts in large part as economic development -- what's it going to create in jobs and income back to the city?'' he said.</p><p>Will Ms. Levin be able to wield the same argument successfully? ''Everybody's watching,'' Ms. Munn said.</p><p>In an interview at her office on West 42nd Street in Manhattan, Ms. Levin suggested that she knew the limitations she faced. ''The cupboard is bare,'' she said. ''There is only so much you can do. It will be my nonstop effort to see that the cultural community is made whole to the extent that it's possible.''</p><p>Complicating matters, Ms. Levin comes to the post when arts institutions are still struggling with declines in attendance and a difficult fund-raising climate in the wake of Sept. 11. Many institutions report drops in ticket sales of 10 percent or more, and foundations offering emergency money to arts groups have been deluged with applications.</p><p>The commissioner's job will be made tougher by having to walk the line between building strong ties to the mayor and challenging him if necessary on behalf of cultural groups. Mr. Bloomberg, who has served on the boards of Lincoln Center and the Jewish Museum, among other cultural groups, has already said that Lincoln Center's $1.2 billion redevelopment and other major capital projects may have to be put off. Ms. Levin's predecessor, Schuyler G. Chapin, was widely criticized for doing too little too late in defense of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its clash with Mr. Giuliani over the ''Sensation'' exhibition, which featured a black Madonna with elephant dung.</p><p>But Ms. Levin has been in city government before. She helped Diane M. Coffey, Mayor Koch's chief of staff, run the cultural affairs department on an interim basis when Bess Myerson stepped down as commissioner. And she has worked with Patricia Harris, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor, who oversees cultural affairs as part of her portfolio. Ms. Harris was also assistant to Mayor Koch and executive director of the Art Commission of the City of New York.</p><p>Both Ms. Coffey and Ms. Harris were said to be instrumental in putting Ms. Levin forward for the job. Among the candidates Ms. Levin beat out were Laurie Tisch Sussman, chairwoman of the Center for Arts Education, and Stephanie French, formerly vice president for corporate contributions at Philip Morris.</p><p>Ms. Levin, 41, who grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is also a seasoned New Yorker who has moved in cultural and literary circles. Her father, Wilbur A. Levin, is the Kings County clerk. Her mother, Phyllis Lee Levin, is a writer. Her husband is the sculptor Mark di Suvero (they have a 7-year-old daughter), who started the Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens, where Ms. Levin served as a consultant.</p>                </div>
