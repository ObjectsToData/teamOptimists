In the 1980's, it was occupied by a series of architects and designers, and briefly by a dot.com company.    But in July, David and Reba Williams, Wall Street executives and art collectors, who live in New York and Greenwich, bought the building to store their collection of 6,000 prints, mostly American, which they have been amassing for over 25 years. The building will also house the Print Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by the Williamses in 1989 that sponsors traveling exhibitions of their prints.  ">

At that time, the collection will be available by appointment only to art historians, collectors, researchers and museum curators for study. It will not be open to the public.</p><p>Pam Gallagher, development director at the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan, said she was glad that the building would be preserved and dedicated to art research and study, and expressed  hope that the entire endeavor would be a boost for downtown Stamford.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Other executives of local arts organizations were also generally welcoming of the arrival of the Williamses in Stamford.</p><p>Many still mourn the departure in March of last year of the Stamford branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art, which had been there 20 years. But though none would speak for attribution, some expressed regret that the Williamses' collection will not be open to the public.</p><p>''We are just not prepared to create a public space with a fulltime staff,'' Mrs. Williams said. ''That's not what we're planning.''</p><p>Suzanne Boorsch, curator of prints, drawings and photographs at the Yale University Art Gallery, sees merit in the Williamses' plans.</p><p>''American cities really suffer from the dispersal of their downtowns,'' she said.  ''The addition of a facility that draws scholars and artists to their downtown -- that  can't be anything but good for Stamford.''</p><p>The collection, which has works dating from the last 100 years, is noteworthy for its pieces from the time of the Depression; it also includes works by Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol, as well as Connecticut artists.</p><p>Antony Griffiths, keeper of the print department at the British Museum in London, one of several museums to which the Williamses have donated works, called the collection ''outstanding.'' David Kiehl, curator of prints at the Whitney, said it was one of richest private collections of American prints worldwide.</p><p>''Most museums don't have a collection that can rival it because most museums cannot spend the time and drive it takes to put it together,'' he said.</p><p>The Williamses -- he is is 69, and she is 65 -- started collecting soon after their marriage in 1975. They were working on Wall Street then and, Mrs. Williams said, feared that a circle of friends developed entirely from their careers could turn them into ''the narrowest people alive.''</p><p>They began collecting prints because, she said, that was what they could afford.</p><p>Both Williamses have M.B.A.'s from Harvard Business School. In 1977, Mr. Williams became chairman and chief executive officer of Alliance Capital Management, a money-management firm in New York. He is now chief executive officer emeritus there as well as chairman of White Williams Private Equity Partners in Stamford.</p><p>Mrs. Williams, who was director of special projects at Alliance, is vice chairman of White Williams.</p><p>Mrs. Williams earned a Ph.D. in art history from the City University of New York in 1996. A former president of the New York City Arts  Commission, she has written articles about finance and art, as well as the text for the catalogs that accompany the print foundation's shows.</p><p>She is on the editorial board of Print Quarterly, where she and her husband offer an annual prize for the best writing about prints.</p><p>Among other arts-related projects, the Williamses helped finance the restoration in 1998 of the Jean Charlot WPA mural in the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities on West 18th Street.</p><p>The couple plans to be active in the Stamford arts world; last month Mrs. Williams joined the board of the Stamford Cultural Development Association. They also have big ambitions for their foundation.</p><p>''We'd like to be compared to the New York Public Library's Print Room, where scholars from everywhere can come to work,'' Mrs. Williams said.</p><p>''We'll have fewer prints and books, of course, but our collection focuses on American artists, and I suspect that we may have greater depth on the artists whose prints we own.''</p><p>Photos: Reba and David Williams, left, have amassed a collection of 6,000 prints, including Andy Warhol's ''Debbie Harry'' (circa 1980), above, and Thomas Hart Benton's ''I Got a Gal on Sourwood Mountain'' (1938), far left. They are moving their collection into Stamford's Advocate building, shown at top, which they bought last July. The collection will be open by appointment only to scholars.
