                    <p>With just two days left for a final barrage of newspaper advertisements, mailings, faxes, telephone calls and face-to-face meetings intended to sway undecided investors, all pretense of civility has been cast aside.</p><p>''I don't believe Carly Fiorina will survive as chief executive if this transaction is turned down,'' Mr. Hewlett said last week. ''This time we don't want someone learning on the job'' -- an allusion to the fact that Ms. Fiorina had not been a chief executive before she came to Hewlett-Packard in 1999.</p><p>The charges and countercharges became more pointed and personal as the proxy campaign progressed. Among the most vivid: Hewlett-Packard dismissed Mr. Hewlett as ''a musician and an academic,'' questioning his credibility and suggesting he was motivated more by emotion than reason. And Mr. Hewlett released boardroom documents intended to portray Ms. Fiorina as both greedy and duplicitous.</p><p>Both Ms. Fiorina and Mr. Hewlett, according to friends and colleagues, have been surprised and at times wounded by the personalization of the proxy fight. Yet their own tactics have largely dictated the character of the campaign.</p><p>THE fight is about money, of course, and shareholder value. But the vote really hinges on two issues: whose vision of Hewlett-Packard's future is more convincing and who merits shareholders' trust.</p><p>The poll will also be a referendum on Ms. Fiorina's leadership. She arrived amid high expectations in July 1999, tapped by the board as a forceful, young outsider and given a mandate to revitalize Hewlett-Packard, a corporate icon in Silicon Valley that seemed to have become sluggish and insular. Ms. Fiorina had been a top executive at Lucent Technologies, the equipment-making unit spun off from AT&amp;T, which was thriving at the time.</p><p>Taking over at Hewlett-Packard was going to be a daunting challenge. But Ms. Fiorina, who is 47, had risen far and fast. She described her career and her decision to go after the Hewlett-Packard job most eloquently at the Stanford University commencement last year.</p><p>In her address, Ms. Fiorina, a Stanford graduate, recalled that when she dropped out of law school, she began her career in business at a real estate firm, just across the street from Hewlett-Packard's headquarters. ''I had a title,'' she said. ''It was not V.P. It was receptionist. I answered the phones. I typed. I filed.'' Yet even at that level, she found business satisfying. ''I liked commerce -- the pace of it, the people of it, the pragmatic problem-solving of it.''</p><p>For her final job interview with the Hewlett-Packard board in 1999, Ms. Fiorina told students, she arrived early and parked in the lot of that real estate firm. ''I thought about the uphill battle that lay ahead if I took the C.E.O. job at H.P.,'' she said. It was a job, she knew, that would come with ''a fair bit of scrutiny and criticism.''</p><p>Still, she walked into a situation that ensured she would confront more scrutiny and criticism than most new chief executives. She was asked to shake up and set a new course for a company with problems -- but not one in a tailspin, as was I.B.M. when Louis V. Gerstner Jr. took over in 1993. She replaced a chief executive, Lewis E. Platt, who may not have been as dynamic and effective a leader as the company's activist board wanted, but who was a 33-year company veteran, liked and admired by the rank-and-file.</p><p>MS. FIORINA was an outsider in a company of home-grown executives. She was a professional manager in a company with an egalitarian engineering culture, dating back to its founding in 1938, by two ambitious young Stanford engineers, William Hewlett and David Packard. And she was a woman, the highest-ranking female executive in America, in an industry where women are particularly scarce at the top.</p><p>Her high profile and the rich pay package required to lure her from Lucent -- mostly stock once valued as high as $85 million, though now at about $35 million -- grated on traditionalists in the company. It all contributed to a general image of Ms. Fiorina as aloof, as fond of corporate luxury and as a practitioner of a command-and-control style of management.</p>                </div>
