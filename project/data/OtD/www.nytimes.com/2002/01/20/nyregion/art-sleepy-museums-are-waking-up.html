It was better than Miss Cooney's algebra class but not as good as a snow day, a low-key peek at the past but not a stirring experience.</p><p>House museums -- a smattering of cultural artifacts set up in a historic dwelling -- occupy the quietest corner of the cultural world. But in Connecticut that is slowly changing, as developments in museum management make their way to these smaller institutions.</p><p>In some cases the Connecticut museums have relatively new directors, who are well aware of the blockbuster exhibitions and savvy marketing that have made New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and other big-city institutions the popular sites they are today. But in others, executives who have been on the job for years have begun adopting newer methods of doing business.</p><p>For example, house museums are increasingly competing with each other and with larger cultural institutions for precious tourist dollars, visitors and financing. They are renovating their properties, focusing on homely improvements like parking and rest rooms but also adding or upgrading gift shops.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In addition, they are revamping presentations with the latest techniques in historic research and interpretation -- explaining the social and economic contexts in which art and artifacts were created, to make it easier for visitors to understand and relate to American history.</p><p>William Hosley, executive director of the Antiquarian &amp; Landmarks Society since 1998, may be one of the best examples of the aggressive leadership style that is infiltrating the world of Connecticut museums. The society, a Hartford organization founded in 1936, owns nine historic houses across the state. These include the 17th-century Joshua Hempsted House in New London; the Nathan Hale Homestead in Coventry; and two Victorian manses -- the Isham Terry House and the Richard Upjohn House -- and the Butler-McCook Homestead, all in Hartford.</p><p>''The most popular heritage destination for Connecticut school children is Sturbridge Village, which is in Massachusetts,'' Mr. Hosley, 46, said recently at his Hartford office. ''We'd like to change all that.''</p><p>He added: ''It's important to reach out to new audiences. There's a new sense of mission at many traditional historical organizations.''</p><p>In part, this is because of new leaders like Mr. Hosley. Other institutions, like the Connecticut Historical Society, have also hired new executives recently. Marjorie St. Aubyn has been executive director of the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion in Norwalk for less than two months. But even museums with more entrenched leadership are changing their ways.</p><p>Mr. Hosley pointed out that his group, as well as the Lockwood-Matthews Mansion, the Mark Twain House in Hartford, and the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme -- a boarding house in the 19th century where American impressionist painters including Childe Hassam spent summers -- all have major development campaigns. The money goes to refurbishing properties and creating and upgrading amenities, like the gift shops. But it also pays for revised presentations.</p><p>For example, Jeffrey Andersen, director of the Griswold Museum for 25 years, said, ''We're in the process of returning the house to what it was in 1900, so we can tell the story of American Impressionism as it was being born and brought along, in and around this place.''</p><p>''We used to walk through houses pointing out Chippendale chairs, and that was it,'' Mr. Andersen added. ''Now we tell stories that people want to hear.''</p><p>The new attitudes are noticeably more sophisticated than the old. Mr. Hosley is working with other Connecticut groups to attract more visitors to Hartford's cultural attractions, using that city's most famous historical figure, Mark Twain, as a lure. ''If Hartford is a heritage mall, the Mark Twain House is its anchor tenant,'' Mr. Hosley said.</p><p>Mr. Hosley is a 1977 graduate of Middlebury College and earned a master's degree from the Winterthur program in early American culture in 1980. Before he came to the antiquarian society, he was curator of American decorative arts for 17 years at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, one of Connecticut's preeminent museums.</p><p>At the atheneum, he organized several exhibitions including ''The Great River: Art &amp; Society of the Connecticut Valley,'' and ''The Japan Idea: Art and Life in Victorian America.'' He has also written numerous scholarly articles and books on decorative arts, as well as ''Colt: The Making of an American Legend'' (University of Massachusetts Press 1996), about the Colt family, which built its firearms empire in Hartford.</p><p>His first major project at the society was to raise nearly $1 million to refurbish the Butler-McCook Homestead at 396 Main Street in Hartford. Beginning in 1782, four generations of the Butler-McCook family -- lawyers, doctors, teachers and businessmen -- lived in the house. But the distinguishing feature of the property, Mr. Hosley said, is that the family never threw anything away. And so their documents, furnishings and family photographs provide a window into American social history.</p><p>''This is the oldest house in Hartford and one of the best-documented houses in America, with a history beginning in 1705,'' Mr. Hosley said. ''But you wouldn't know it from the way we used to present it.''</p><p>Renovation of the property is under way, including repairs to the house and the construction of a history center in the former 19th-century medical office of Dr. John McCook. The house is scheduled to reopen in June, with a dramatic presentation of the family saga, Mr. Hosley said.</p><p>''We'll reinforce the relationship between the house and its Main Street environment, and with the rest of Hartford,'' Mr. Hosley said.</p><p>The exhibition will introduce visitors to 300 years of Main Street history as experienced by four generations of Butlers and McCooks, he said.</p><p>The money for this project came primarily from private sources.</p><p>''Connecticut has invested $66 million in the arts in recent years, but very little of that money went to heritage projects,'' Mr. Hosley said. He estimated that when the complex is complete, it will attract 11,700 visitors a year. If each visitor spends an average of $75 while in the Hartford area, that will mean $877,500 a year in tourism income, he said.</p><p>In addition to upgrading the society's holdings, Mr. Hosley is working with the Greater Hartford Arts Council and the Connecticut Humanities Council to try to attract more tourists to Hartford, which is also home to the Connecticut State Capitol and the Museum of Connecticut History.</p><p>''The greater Hartford area has historic attractions that any city would love to have,'' Mr. Hosley said. ''We have to get that message out.''</p><p>Photos: William Hosley has brought an aggressive leadership style to the Antiquarian & Landmarks Society and its nine historic properties in Connecticut, including the Butler-McCook Homestead in Hartford, where he is shown above, and the Joshua Hempsted House in New London, below.
