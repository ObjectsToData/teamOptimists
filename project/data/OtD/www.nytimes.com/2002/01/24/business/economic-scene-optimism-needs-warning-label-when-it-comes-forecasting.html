    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="ONE tantalizing question in economics these days is whether productivity will rise as rapidly after this recession as it did in the late 1990's. If productivity -- the output of the economy per hour of work -- grows robustly, so will the economy. But if it does not, wages will not rise rapidly, profits will be weaker, and federal revenue will be much lower than expected. America may again find itself in a state of political confusion and disarray, just as it did in the slow-growing era from 1973 to 1995.    At first glance, a few new studies on productivity's future suggest that there is ample reason to be optimistic. For example, two Federal Reserve economists, Stephen D. Oliner and Dan E. Sichel, say the range of productivity growth is likely to be 2 to 2.75 percent a year in coming years. From 1995 and 2001, productivity grew by roughly 2.3 percent a year.  ">

                    <p>First, the midrange conclusions of these studies assume that semiconductor and computer prices will continue to fall at the same stunning pace they did in the late 1990's, or at worst, not much more slowly. Can the industry keep up this level of innovation? Not everyone thinks it can.</p><p>Second, the studies assume that while investment in high technology may have been overenthusiastic in the 1990's, it will resume at a robust pace once the recession passes. A reason this is important is because a large part of the nation's total productivity gain in the 1990's was concentrated in the makers, not the users, of computer hardware, software and telecommunications equipment. If their sales growth tapers off, so will the entire economy's productivity. But some observers argue that business and home users already have more computer power than they need.</p><p>Third, most of these studies do not allow for the impact of cyclical demand. But, writes Mr. Baily, now at the Institute for International Economics, such rising demand may well have been an important cause of capital investment in high technology as sales and profits rose. And that demand benefited from loosening monetary policy, an unusually high dollar, which kept foreign capital coming in and inflation down, and soaring stock prices.</p><p>In addition, rising productivity in wholesale and retail trade, apparently a big source of productivity gains outside computers, was probably highly dependent on rapidly rising demand for goods. And rising productivity in the securities business, another big source of the nation's productivity gains, was particularly dependent on the soaring stock market. Will that recur?</p><p>So Mr. Baily is among the less optimistic of the productivity watchers unless demand keeps rising rapidly. But even his own modest forecast depends on counting productivity differently from most others. He says the Bureau of Labor Statistics' productivity data, based on estimates of production in the economy, are not necessarily accurate. Estimates of income, the other side of the financial statement, suggest more rapid productivity gains in the 1980's and 1990's. Mr. Baily averages the two. Again, by no means does everyone agree.</p><p>If these assumptions do not fall into place, it is entirely possible that productivity will grow over time by less than 2 percent. Mr. Oliner and Mr. Sichel's lower estimate of 2 percent, for example, would be significantly too high if computer prices fell only as fast as in the early 1990's while the portion of capital investment in high technology slowed even moderately. If Mr. Baily's estimate were put on a consistent basis with the other estimates, his lower limit would be significantly less than 2 percent a year. And such growth is far less than what the Congressional Budget Office is forecasting to determine future federal surpluses.</p><p>One lasting contribution of these studies, however, is that they help further puncture the romanticism about the new economy. The Oliner-Sichel study, for example, sees little benefit to purchasers of computers from ''network effects,'' externalities, or increasing economies of scale. In other words, just because one company buys a computer does not mean that the productivity of other companies, even if they already have computers, will also rise.</p><p>On the other hand, a study by the McKinsey Global Institute concludes that there were such additional gains in productivity. But McKinsey says many of those came from managerial and organization innovations, like Wal-Mart's popular ''big store'' in retailing.</p><p>As Mr. Baily notes, such a conclusion is grounds for optimism. It suggests that future productivity is not completely dependent on how much companies invest in high technology, but on how innovative our companies can be across the board.</p><p>Thus, the nation has its work cut out for it. Government must maintain stable policies that sustain growth. Our companies must remain innovative and competitive. Antitrust policies probably need to be more closely enforced. In addition, in my view, investment funds cannot be wasted in rampant overspeculation, fed by opaque information from corporations and deliberate obfuscation by Wall Street. And, I would add, public investment in education, health care, infrastructure and research must be reinvigorated. Public investment is an area mainstream economists all too readily neglect at the nation's peril.</p><p>One immediate source of optimism should be taken with a grain of salt, however. Productivity has risen about 1.5 percent in the current recession, which has never happened before in the post-World War II period. But there have also never before been such harsh employment practices. Expendable temporary workers and the ease with which companies lay workers off are important sources of this productivity performance. They are not necessarily sources of long-term economic strength.</p><p>Photo: High technology's impact on productivity may be greatest in high technology.
