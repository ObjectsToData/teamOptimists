                    <p>''I felt slavery was wrong,'' Chabrenna replied.</p><p>Adrian and Chabrenna have thrived, their teachers say, at the 12th Street Academy, a small alternative school in the East Village, where they have only 139 classmates in seventh and eighth grade. But this fall the 12th Street Academy is scheduled to begin shutting down by not being allowed to accept any new students.</p><p>New York State and Harold O. Levy, the city's schools chancellor, say that the school is failing its students, and judging by the test scores, it would be hard to argue: only 3 percent of its eighth graders met state standards in English in 2001, down from 11 percent in 1999, and 9 percent in math, down from 26 percent in 1999.</p><p>To the partisans of the 12th Street Academy, the decision to close it raises questions about how a school should be judged -- whether primarily by test scores or by more intangible factors, like the quality of relationships between teachers and students, the enthusiasm of students for learning, and how well students fare after graduating. By those measures, they say, the academy has in its six years of operation scored high.</p><p>They also see the decision as part of a larger philosophical battle over whether small specialized programs should be directed toward advanced students or toward those who may be difficult to teach. They say that in Community School District 1, where the 12th Street Academy is located, Mr. Levy and the district superintendent, Helen C. Santiago, are trying to improve woeful district-wide test scores by creating programs that attract gifted students who will push the averages up, rather than by finding better ways to teach children from difficult backgrounds.</p><p>The district has put out a request for proposals for a new middle school, which some board members of District 1 said they feared would turn out to be another school aimed at gifted children. The district's main middle school, Junior High School 56, has nearly 1,200 students. Last year, only 25 percent of its eighth graders met state standards in both English and math.</p><p>''Yes, test scores are important,'' said Nancy Easton, director of the 12th Street Academy, who founded it with a Princeton University classmate.</p><p>''But there are kids coming to middle school not reading. What are we going to do with these kids who can't read? Are we going to dump them all in a huge school? Who's going to be here for them if we go away?''</p><p>Ms. Easton said that as the school's reputation for engaging academically troubled students spread, it became a magnet for difficult students, depressing the test scores. She argues that the school should be given three years to improve, the usual grace period for schools on the state's failing list.</p><p>Other failing schools have been able to turn around. In 1996, the Family Academy, an elementary school in Harlem, posted the lowest reading scores in the city. Within a year, using phonics and a more test-conscious approach to reading, the school's scores rose sharply.</p><p>Mr. Levy bridles at the argument that he should make allowances for the 12th Street Academy because of the background of its students. ''It is indefensible to claim it's the fault of the children,'' Mr. Levy said. ''They should have been at a good school three years ago. Time has run out.''</p><p>The academy has also been caught up in a sort of class warfare that has erupted in District 1, which encompasses the Lower East Side and the East Village. The battle pits the old-line white leftist families and working-class Hispanic families against an influx of more affluent, mainly white families. The old-timers say that while they are dismayed by the low academic achievement in their schools, they are against what they characterize as elitist solutions like programs for gifted students. The newcomers say they want their children to get the most rigorous possible education, even if that might mean separating high achievers from low achievers.</p><p>The two sides have fought bitterly over the creation of New Explorations Into Science, Technology and Math, a school that will eventually go from kindergarten to 12th grade, at the eastern end of Houston Street. Admissions to the school, housed in a building that once contained a failing school, are competitive, based partly on test scores.</p><p>Mr. Levy, who supported NEST, as it is called, also wants to move Bard High School Early College, a school for children who want to complete the first two years of college during high school, from Brooklyn into Public School 97, now a failing elementary school.</p><p>At 12th Street Academy, many of Ms. Easton's students wonder who will be there for them if the school closes. Adrian Rivera said his older sister dropped out of high school, although she later earned her high school equivalency diploma. Adrian bubbles with excitement as he shows a visitor around the school, describing the seventh-grade geometry project, ''Create Your Dream House,'' and telling how he was inspired by boxing at the Boys' Club to write his biographical report on Muhammad Ali.</p><p>''It's a small school, and you can't really find those,'' he said. He even defends the homework: ''It challenges us. It's not like something easy.''</p><p>Teachers, adds Falisha West, an eighth grader, will help students who need it during lunch, after school and on Saturdays.</p><p>A recent state inspection faulted the academy for being undersupplied -- books of all kinds, especially textbooks, were scarce, the state report said. The state inspectors frowned on the ''relaxed climate'' of the school, and recommended that students call teachers ''Ms.'' or ''Mr.'' instead of by their first names.</p><p>To the school's supporters, the state report and Mr. Levy's reaction to it suggest a misunderstanding of the nature of small alternative schools generally, and this one in particular. The 12th Street Academy was created to be a place where students could cultivate intimate, informal relationships with their teachers, and where they would learn through exploration and their own research, rather than through conventional textbooks. If the school is undersupplied, Ms. Easton said, that has as much to do with underfinancing by the Board of Education as with any kind of policy set by the school itself.</p><p>Photos: Adrian Rivera, top right, a seventh grader, says homework at the 12th Street Academy ''challenges us.''
