The Commercial Court in Jakarta ruled last week that the Manulife Indonesia unit of the Manulife Financial Corporation, one of the two dominant insurance companies in Canada (the other is Sun Life), was bankrupt because it had failed to pay a dividend to shareholders in 1999. The court was acting on a petition from the receiver supervising a company controlled by Suyanto Gondokusumo, a powerful businessman during the Suharto era and a former joint venture partner of Manulife.

The Commercial Court in Jakarta ruled last week that the Manulife Indonesia unit of the Manulife Financial Corporation, one of the two dominant insurance companies in Canada (the other is Sun Life), was bankrupt because it had failed to pay a dividend to shareholders in 1999. The court was acting on a petition from the receiver supervising a company controlled by Suyanto Gondokusumo, a powerful businessman during the Suharto era and a former joint venture partner of Manulife.

Foreign businesspeople see it as the most blatant signal so far that the nearly year-old government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri, for all its protestations to the contrary, is not prepared to clean up pervasive corruption in the courts. Particularly galling was the fact that just days before the ruling, senior government officials told major foreign donors that transparency in business dealings was a top priority.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The court that rendered the ruling was supposed to be part of the solution. It was set up in 1999 with the aid of the International Monetary Fund to help strengthen the rule of law in business dealings.</p><p>But its judges are poorly paid, and some foreign investors suspect that payoffs may have been involved in the ruling against Manulife. One prominent Indonesian questioned the ruling as well, though not directly. In an odd twist to a case that is receiving front-page attention here, a senior Indonesian official, the director general of financial institutions of the Ministry of Finance, published advertisements in newspapers on Tuesday asserting that Manulife was actually solvent.</p><p>The Canadian government, the International Finance Corporation and foreign executives have all pressed the Megawati government to publicly condemn the bankruptcy ruling, to no avail.</p><p>Carol Hessler. the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta, said the ramifications of the court decision go far beyond one Canadian company.</p><p>''This is not a Canadian issue,'' Ms. Hessler said. ''This is about how foreign investments are treated. This is a desperate situation for foreign investments in this country.''</p><p>The Canadian ambassador to Indonesia, Ferry De Kerckhove, said the Manulife case was of ''grave concern,'' and that so far, the Indonesian government had refused to recognize the severity of the situation. What is necessary, the ambassador said, ''is for the government of Indonesia to take ownership of the issue rather than hiding behind the curtain of saying this is under the control of the courts.''</p><p>But in a reflection of a dominant Indonesian view, a prominent political analyst said the complaints of Western governments and businesses were highhanded. ''It is absurd for the investment community to ask the Indonesian government to intervene in the court system,'' said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, the deputy chairman for social sciences and humanities at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. ''Under Suharto the judiciary was the tool of the government. Now we have tried to separate the three branches of government. The fact the judiciary makes foolish rulings doesn't mean the government should intervene.''</p><p>Many critics of the ruling said that it was particularly unfair that Manulife was the company on the short end of it. Most foreign companies with established presences here have not invested much new money during the turbulence of the last two years, but Manulife was seen as one of the brave few willing to do so. The Manulife case has foreign investors on edge for another reason: This is the first time a foreign company has taken over its Indonesian partner in a hostile process.</p><p>The problems between Manulife and its former partner that led to the court ruling began in May 2000 when Dharmala Sakti Sejahtera, a company in the Gondokusumo family's business empire, declared bankruptcy. At the time, Dharmala owned 40 percent of Manulife Indonesia and the Canadian company 51 percent.</p><p>In October 2000, the government oversaw an auction of Dharmala's stake, and Manulife bought it. The purchase was immediately contested by a company in the British Virgin Islands called Roman Gold Assets, which claimed to have bought the stake two weeks earlier. Manulife has contended that Roman Gold is a front set up by the Gondokusumo family to retain control of the stake. Attempts to reach family members were unsuccessful.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Adi Purnomo, the vice president of Manulife Indonesia, was arrested, accused of fraud, held without charges for 20 days in a cell at the central police station in Jakarta, and released only after heavy lobbying by the Canadian government. Western officials said the intense questioning by the police was an effort to get Mr. Purnomo to make statements in favor of Dharmala.</p><p>The bankruptcy ruling was also a setback for the International Finance Corporation, the arm of the World Bank that lends to businesses; it owns the remaining 9 percent of Manulife Indonesia. The I.F.C.'s chief representative in Indonesia, Amitava Banerjee, said the case showed that strong companies ''can be brought down by the machinations of malicious interested parties, and there is no protection in the court of law.''</p><p>After the Asian financial crises of the late 1990's and the collapse of the Suharto regime in 1998, foreign investment in Indonesia contracted sharply. Security concerns after the Sept. 11 attacks made matters worse.</p><p>Foreign executives say it is increasingly difficult to do business in Indonesia because the courts are often a marketplace where the sizes of bribes decide cases. Under Suharto, they say, corruption was at least organized in a fairly predictable hierarchical system; now it is running out of control.</p><p>The American ambassador to Indonesia, Ralph Boyce, has said publicly since he arrived earlier this year that reform of the courts and the legal system was the most important step Indonesia could take to attract new investment. In particular, he said in a speech that the ''criminalization'' by the authorities of disputes involving foreign investors was a deterrent of major proportions for companies considering Indonesia as a place to do business.</p><p>Photo: Manulife Indonesia employees protest outside of Parliament against a ruling that declared Manulife bankrupt.
