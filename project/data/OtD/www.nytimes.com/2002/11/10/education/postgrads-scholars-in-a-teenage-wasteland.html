''I realized that it was my job now to deal with it, that it was as important as figuring how to teach 'Oedipus,''' recalls Dr. Januzzi Thomas, who is in her fourth year at Northern Valley Regional High School in Demarest, N.J., where she teaches English and drama.</p><p>The commandeering of the Game Boy unnerved her, as did the sudden appearance of students bearing blue tardy slips, the mid-lecture phone calls about field trip forms and all the other intrusions on her impassioned flow of thoughts about Greek tragedy.</p>                </div>

                    <p>She does not care for telling students when they can go to the bathroom. ''Some would argue it's a key aspect of teaching, the management of these details,'' she says. ''It's definitely something one learns to accommodate, but that accommodation takes up mental energy, and that means I have less mental energy for real thinking.''</p><p>Such adjustments are to be expected for someone who had breathed the rarefied air of academe for eight years. ''I miss the exhilaration of diving into the sea of ideas,'' she says.</p><p>Dr. Januzzi Thomas is among a small but growing number of public school teachers who hold doctorates in subjects other than education. According to the most recent figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage increased from 0.5 percent in 1991 to 1.7 percent in 1996 (slightly more for high schools and private schools). The number is estimated to have risen since then.</p><p>For Dr. Januzzi Thomas, taking the job at Northern Valley was an easy decision. She practically doubled her university salary, with a pay scale that tops in the $90,000's, and she received tenure this past September. Back at the university, her career and finances seemed less secure. ''Knowing that you could be doing this for seven years and not get tenure,'' she says, ''the personal cost involved in staking your life on something that's always a gamble can seem too high.''</p><p>The academic job market for Ph.D.'s has been bleak for years, especially in humanities and life sciences. In 2000, 1,070 new Ph.D.'s in English competed among themselves and with former graduates for 528 tenure-track assistant professorships, according to the Modern Language Association. The outlook in other fields is also discouraging. Typically, those who do not land good jobs hang on as research assistants or as poorly paid adjuncts, or they try to break into industry.</p><p>But some go into lower education, where they can tap their academic interests. They are particularly drawn to private schools, where they are not hemmed in by a curriculum, and certification is not required (people who have spent 4 to 10 years chasing a doctorate are not generally eager to sit through education courses). They are also motivated by a passion for teaching that was not applauded at the university level. Lawrence Goodman, who is now a director at the Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, says that most of his English professors at the University of Chicago tried to divert him from his true interests. ''I wanted to be a teacher,'' he says. ''They were grooming me for the kind of career that hinged on research.''</p><p>A perceived lack of respect is one big reason few Ph.D.'s consider lower education. Mentors and colleagues tell them they are wasting their time. ''There's a definite sense that it's complete academic suicide,'' Dr. Januzzi Thomas says. ''If I wanted to continue on the academic track, I would have been better off working in a bookstore and writing my book.''</p><p>Bryan K. Garman insists that he maintains an active scholarly life teaching at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, where six of nine history teachers have doctorates. He recently published a book based on his dissertation, ''A Race of Singers: Whitman's Working-Class Hero From Guthrie to Springsteen,'' through the University of North Carolina Press.</p><p>''There's a real bias from people who are in the profession who know that you're teaching at a prep school,'' says Dr. Garman, who has just been appointed principal. ''I've been at conferences delivering papers and have had colleagues come up and say, 'What are you doing there?'''</p><p>The teachers argue that a research background makes them better in the classroom, especially in science -- they actually understand the subject. And they can identify better with their students' academic struggles, having spent years doing the same. For those reasons, the National Research Council published a report in July on the need to attract science and mathematics Ph.D.'s to secondary-school education. While more than 30 percent of graduate students surveyed had considered teaching below the college level, fewer than 1 percent actually did. The study suggested offering incentives like opportunities for fellowships and research, and better laboratory equipment.</p><p>Robert Weisbuch, president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J., is foremost among those trying to figure out how to lure more humanities Ph.D.'s into classrooms. He says schools do little to provide intellectual opportunities for their teachers.</p><p>''Someone with a Ph.D. has an investment in that discipline,'' Dr. Weisbuch says. ''If we don't give our teachers a sense of the ongoing life of academic subjects, then they can't do it for their students, and they will teach relic knowledge to students who will be utterly unengaged.''</p><p>Dr. Weisbuch might turn to the teachers themselves, who are advertisements for their chosen path. The teachers see younger students as less jaded than their collegiate counterparts and more willing to take intellectual risks, and they appreciate having an impact on a student's life in a way not always open to professors.</p><p>After earning his Ph.D. in English from the University of California at Los Angeles, Robert James spent three years trying to break into a tight job market while tutoring boys at Cathedral High School in Los Angeles. Finally, when the school advertised a teaching position, his wife urged him to apply. Dr. James was skeptical, but he took the job.</p><p>''Within a month I knew this is where I wanted to be for the rest of my life,'' he says. ''For me, teaching here I know that every day I come to work I'm changing someone's life. I never had that feeling in college.''</p><p>Bill Stephenson, an English teacher at the Woodlands Christian Academy in Houston, tells a similar story. ''I get so personally interested in these students,'' says Dr. Stephenson, who formerly taught at the University of Texas at Austin and Northland College in Ashland, Wis. ''I think about them all the time. When I was a college professor, I never thought about my students personally -- it wasn't part of the game.''</p><p>Photos: No ivy here: Dr. Marisa Januzzi Thomas in the halls of learning -- Northern Valley Regional High in New Jersey.
