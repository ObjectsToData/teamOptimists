    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In a beige classroom so spare that there isn't a poster or a bookcase to warm it, Elaine Bobrove passes out her last reading assignment of the semester -- Langston Hughes's ''Theme for English B.'' It's a clear enough poem, about a black student trying to relate to his white instructor, a perfect assignment for a rainy spring day when Ms. Bobrove's Camden County College students are through with finals and ready to put her remedial reading course behind them.    The impatience for this last class to end is palpable, but the sanguine Ms. Bobrove forges ahead with one final discussion.     ''So,'' she starts, ''what did you learn from each other and what did you learn from me?'' She is echoing the poem's penultimate sentence: ''As I learn from you,/ I guess you learn from me -/ although you're older -- and white -/ and somewhat more free.''  ">

She has no office (the windshield of her station wagon sports a sun reflector that reads ''Adjunct Office'') and receives no benefits, though she has taught at Camden County for 20 years. The room where she alternately coaxes and goads literary insights, a sagging ceiling tile its only remarkable feature, is an apt metaphor for a low-overhead, no-frills academic career.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The students shift in their chairs and stare out the windows toward the full parking lots and freshly mown</p><p>lawns of their campus in suburban Blackwood, N.J., about 15 miles from Philadelphia. This is one of New Jersey's biggest community colleges, where SAT's are not required, tuition costs $1,860 a year and, as Ms. Bobrove puts it, ''We give people second chances.''</p><p>''What did you like best, of all the things we read here?'' she presses.</p><p>Finally, a young woman breaks the silence by singling out the essay ''Arranging a Marriage in India,'' by the cultural anthropologist Serena Nanda. That fires up her classmate, John Hoffman, who straightens his slouch to defend a man's right to pick his own bride. ''You spend your whole lifetime looking at women,'' he argues passionately. ''I don't want to marry that chick. I want to marry this chick I met on the street!''</p><p>''Did it make you think about different cultures?'' Ms. Bobrove persists, once the laughter dies down.</p><p>''Yeah.''</p><p>''Good. That's what reading's all about.''</p><p>Community colleges have always made generous use of part-time teachers; at Camden County, they outnumber full-timers about 3 to 1. Their mission -- to make higher education more accessible -- depends on low tuition. Staffing fluctuates with enrollment. Community colleges are also big providers of vocational training, whose instructors are expected to bring real-life experience into the classroom.</p><p>But perma-temps like Ms. Bobrove are becoming more common, not only in cash-poor two-year colleges but also in well-endowed four-year institutions. Forty-three percent of the faculty members at all institutions are part time. Moreover, from 1993 to 1998, the last period for which the Department of Education has compiled data, 40 percent of all institutions took some action to reduce full-time faculty; of those, 22 percent replaced them with part-time instructors.</p><p>The cost-efficient, highly flexible system of perma-temps, used for years by community colleges, is serving as a template for the rest of academe, including some of the country's most prestigious universities. At New York University, where part-time teachers voted this summer to join a union, the number of adjuncts (2,700, not including summer instructors) nearly equals the number of full-timers (3,100).</p><p>There are several theories about the prevalence of contingent faculty, the most popular and cynical being money.</p><p>''It's just a reality that part-time, adjunct faculty substantially reduce institutional payrolls,'' said Richard Chait, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and an expert in how colleges and universities are managed.</p><p>Though their increasing presence has prompted widespread concern -- among parents who want full professors for their tuition dollars and among parity-seeking part-timers who have initiated union drives across the country -- little research has been done on the effects of part-time teachers on education. In the classroom, experts say, the difference in teaching quality between tenured and contingent instructors seems to be indiscernible, especially among students who themselves are increasingly part time. Only a handful of very limited studies have been done on adjunct teaching, and they have found (in some cases, to the benefit of the institutions conducting the studies) that most students are only vaguely aware of their teachers' employment status.</p><p>There are consequences, but they are subtle, experts say -- in the lack of adjuncts' participation in campus life, their absence as student advisers and curriculum planners and in the ultimate vulnerability of a faculty fractured into tiers of privilege, including many without the protection of tenure.</p>                </div>
