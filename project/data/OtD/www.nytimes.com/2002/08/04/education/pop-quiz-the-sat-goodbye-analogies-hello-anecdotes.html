    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In June, the College Board announced plans for a new and improved SAT I, in part to mollify its biggest client, the University of California, which had criticized the entrance exam for not reflecting high school curriculum. Among the changes, there will be no more analogies -- a question format students confront for the first time on the exam itself (or in test prep) -- but there will be an on-the-spot 20-minute writing exercise. Below, some farewell analogies (at left) and a peek at the future. The revised SAT will be ready in 2005. Start prepping.    Select a pair of words that best expresses a relationship similar to that expressed in the original pair.        1.

The three essays below were written in June by SAT II test-takers, responding to the prompt, ''There is always a 'however.''' How did they fare? Essays are rated holistically on a scale of 1 to 6. Some of the scale's criteria:     1. Incompetence -- very poor organization, very thin development, usage and syntactic errors that can obscure meaning.    2. Some incompetence -- poor organization, thin development, little or inappropriate detail to support ideas, frequent errors in grammar, diction and sentence structure.     3. Developing competence -- inadequate organization or    development, inappropriate or insufficient details, an accumulation of errors in grammar, diction or sentence structure.     4. Adequate competence -- organized, somewhat developed, uses examples to support ideas, some errors in grammar or diction, minimal sentence variety.    5. Reasonably consistent competence -- generally well    organized, adequately developed, appropriate examples, some syntactic variety and range of vocabulary.    6. Clear and consistent competence -- well organized, fully    developed, clearly appropriate examples, variety in sentence structure and vocabulary, may have occasional errors.    Essay A    WHEN using ''however'' it means a veriady of diffrent things. However can be a contunuints to a sentence so it flows into another topic. For example, I would like to go to the store; however I need to go to the dry cleaner. So in other words ''how'' mean how to do something; ''ever'' mean when you going to do it. So putting this word together should up the deffinition and made it esser to understand. This word is complexed; ''however'' can be determined as more difficult than it really is. Technology uses it to put one invention to say it could do more than just on this. Or many you could say. In carrent events they must use ''however'' to get a better point across or to make there sentences flow with each other. There will always be an however.    Essay B    I STRONGLY agree with the statement ''there is always a however.'' In a world as diversified as ours, many opinions exist regarding every issue that I can possibly think of. Every situation or issue has at least two sides. Two compelling examples lie in the fields of politics and technology.    In the United States we live in a democratic society. People have different points of views on political issues and it is these various views that separate society into several political parties. The two largest parties being the Democrats and Republicans One party argues that abortion should be allowed. However, the other party views abortion as an immoral and murderous act. Politics are based on the ''howevers,'' without them our democracy would be unable to function.    The culture of the world as a whole has been influenced greatly by the influx of technology. Similar to all life-altering inventions, technology has created much controversy. Some view it as a corruption to society. However, many see it as a privledge and a miraculous step forward for mankind. More specifically, the issue of cloning has erupted much conflict. Cloning can be viewed as an unnatural process that takes advantage of scientific discoveries, while others see it as a beginning for greater technological advancements.    The world depends on different points of views. Politics and technology are only two of the millions of ideas that thrive on the diversified opinions of the people who are a part of them.    Essay C    Human experience is littered with ambiguities. Though since our earliest days we have sought comfort in the clear-cut and in the exact, we quickly ran up against the fact that the human mind is far too complex to lend itself to definite answers or absolute clarity. Though we resigned ourselves to uncertainty in the humanities ever since they came into being, it was only recently that we have detected the same lack of sureness in fields formerly thought to be unwaveringly objective: mathematics and science. People have discovered, at long last, that it cannot shield itself from the grim spectre of uncertainty in any field of human thought.    Take, for instance, the field of history. One would imagine that there would only be one way to record past events, that historical recollection would be an area of study free from the ''howevers'' that plague other fields. Sadly, however, historical data is filtered through the highly subjective prism of human perception, and one historical occurence could give rise to dozens of dissenting opinions. One must only read the accounts of Thomas Bailey and Richard Hofstader, who are traditionalists, and Howard Zinn, who is labeled as a revisionist, to observe how differently various historians report the same event. History is not a sanctuary of certainty; in fact, its subjectiveness is an integral part of what makes it so fascinating to such a large number of people.    There is no refuge from uncertainty. With their discoveries, the scientist Werner Heisenberg and the mathematician Kurt GÃ¶del sealed the fate of absolutism and pushed humanity into an abyss of relativism and ambiguity. This abyss is a sun-drenched valley rather than a craggy chasm, for it is this uncertainty that will keep humanity hard at work formulating new discoveries for millennia.  ">

The three essays below were written in June by SAT II test-takers, responding to the prompt, ''There is always a 'however.''' How did they fare? Essays are rated holistically on a scale of 1 to 6. Some of the scale's criteria:     1. Incompetence -- very poor organization, very thin development, usage and syntactic errors that can obscure meaning.    2. Some incompetence -- poor organization, thin development, little or inappropriate detail to support ideas, frequent errors in grammar, diction and sentence structure.     3. Developing competence -- inadequate organization or    development, inappropriate or insufficient details, an accumulation of errors in grammar, diction or sentence structure.     4. Adequate competence -- organized, somewhat developed, uses examples to support ideas, some errors in grammar or diction, minimal sentence variety.    5. Reasonably consistent competence -- generally well    organized, adequately developed, appropriate examples, some syntactic variety and range of vocabulary.    6. Clear and consistent competence -- well organized, fully    developed, clearly appropriate examples, variety in sentence structure and vocabulary, may have occasional errors.    Essay A    WHEN using ''however'' it means a veriady of diffrent things. However can be a contunuints to a sentence so it flows into another topic. For example, I would like to go to the store; however I need to go to the dry cleaner. So in other words ''how'' mean how to do something; ''ever'' mean when you going to do it. So putting this word together should up the deffinition and made it esser to understand. This word is complexed; ''however'' can be determined as more difficult than it really is. Technology uses it to put one invention to say it could do more than just on this. Or many you could say. In carrent events they must use ''however'' to get a better point across or to make there sentences flow with each other. There will always be an however.    Essay B    I STRONGLY agree with the statement ''there is always a however.'' In a world as diversified as ours, many opinions exist regarding every issue that I can possibly think of. Every situation or issue has at least two sides. Two compelling examples lie in the fields of politics and technology.    In the United States we live in a democratic society. People have different points of views on political issues and it is these various views that separate society into several political parties. The two largest parties being the Democrats and Republicans One party argues that abortion should be allowed. However, the other party views abortion as an immoral and murderous act. Politics are based on the ''howevers,'' without them our democracy would be unable to function.    The culture of the world as a whole has been influenced greatly by the influx of technology. Similar to all life-altering inventions, technology has created much controversy. Some view it as a corruption to society. However, many see it as a privledge and a miraculous step forward for mankind. More specifically, the issue of cloning has erupted much conflict. Cloning can be viewed as an unnatural process that takes advantage of scientific discoveries, while others see it as a beginning for greater technological advancements.    The world depends on different points of views. Politics and technology are only two of the millions of ideas that thrive on the diversified opinions of the people who are a part of them.    Essay C    Human experience is littered with ambiguities. Though since our earliest days we have sought comfort in the clear-cut and in the exact, we quickly ran up against the fact that the human mind is far too complex to lend itself to definite answers or absolute clarity. Though we resigned ourselves to uncertainty in the humanities ever since they came into being, it was only recently that we have detected the same lack of sureness in fields formerly thought to be unwaveringly objective: mathematics and science. People have discovered, at long last, that it cannot shield itself from the grim spectre of uncertainty in any field of human thought.    Take, for instance, the field of history. One would imagine that there would only be one way to record past events, that historical recollection would be an area of study free from the ''howevers'' that plague other fields. Sadly, however, historical data is filtered through the highly subjective prism of human perception, and one historical occurence could give rise to dozens of dissenting opinions. One must only read the accounts of Thomas Bailey and Richard Hofstader, who are traditionalists, and Howard Zinn, who is labeled as a revisionist, to observe how differently various historians report the same event. History is not a sanctuary of certainty; in fact, its subjectiveness is an integral part of what makes it so fascinating to such a large number of people.    There is no refuge from uncertainty. With their discoveries, the scientist Werner Heisenberg and the mathematician Kurt GÃ¶del sealed the fate of absolutism and pushed humanity into an abyss of relativism and ambiguity. This abyss is a sun-drenched valley rather than a craggy chasm, for it is this uncertainty that will keep humanity hard at work formulating new discoveries for millennia.  "></div>

The three essays below were written in June by SAT II test-takers, responding to the prompt, ''There is always a 'however.''' How did they fare? Essays are rated holistically on a scale of 1 to 6. Some of the scale's criteria:</p><p>1. Incompetence -- very poor organization, very thin development, usage and syntactic errors that can obscure meaning.</p><p>2. Some incompetence -- poor organization, thin development, little or inappropriate detail to support ideas, frequent errors in grammar, diction and sentence structure.</p><p>3. Developing competence -- inadequate organization or</p><p>development, inappropriate or insufficient details, an accumulation of errors in grammar, diction or sentence structure.</p><p>4. Adequate competence -- organized, somewhat developed, uses examples to support ideas, some errors in grammar or diction, minimal sentence variety.</p><p>5. Reasonably consistent competence -- generally well</p><p>organized, adequately developed, appropriate examples, some syntactic variety and range of vocabulary.</p><p>6. Clear and consistent competence -- well organized, fully</p><p>developed, clearly appropriate examples, variety in sentence structure and vocabulary, may have occasional errors.</p><p>Essay A</p><p>WHEN using ''however'' it means a veriady of diffrent things. However can be a contunuints to a sentence so it flows into another topic. For example, I would like to go to the store; however I need to go to the dry cleaner. So in other words ''how'' mean how to do something; ''ever'' mean when you going to do it. So putting this word together should up the deffinition and made it esser to understand. This word is complexed; ''however'' can be determined as more difficult than it really is. Technology uses it to put one invention to say it could do more than just on this. Or many you could say. In carrent events they must use ''however'' to get a better point across or to make there sentences flow with each other. There will always be an however.</p><p>Essay B</p><p>I STRONGLY agree with the statement ''there is always a however.'' In a world as diversified as ours, many opinions exist regarding every issue that I can possibly think of. Every situation or issue has at least two sides. Two compelling examples lie in the fields of politics and technology.</p><p>In the United States we live in a democratic society. People have different points of views on political issues and it is these various views that separate society into several political parties. The two largest parties being the Democrats and Republicans One party argues that abortion should be allowed. However, the other party views abortion as an immoral and murderous act. Politics are based on the ''howevers,'' without them our democracy would be unable to function.</p><p>The culture of the world as a whole has been influenced greatly by the influx of technology. Similar to all life-altering inventions, technology has created much controversy. Some view it as a corruption to society. However, many see it as a privledge and a miraculous step forward for mankind. More specifically, the issue of cloning has erupted much conflict. Cloning can be viewed as an unnatural process that takes advantage of scientific discoveries, while others see it as a beginning for greater technological advancements.</p><p>The world depends on different points of views. Politics and technology are only two of the millions of ideas that thrive on the diversified opinions of the people who are a part of them.</p><p>Essay C</p><p>Human experience is littered with ambiguities. Though since our earliest days we have sought comfort in the clear-cut and in the exact, we quickly ran up against the fact that the human mind is far too complex to lend itself to definite answers or absolute clarity. Though we resigned ourselves to uncertainty in the humanities ever since they came into being, it was only recently that we have detected the same lack of sureness in fields formerly thought to be unwaveringly objective: mathematics and science. People have discovered, at long last, that it cannot shield itself from the grim spectre of uncertainty in any field of human thought.</p><p>Take, for instance, the field of history. One would imagine that there would only be one way to record past events, that historical recollection would be an area of study free from the ''howevers'' that plague other fields. Sadly, however, historical data is filtered through the highly subjective prism of human perception, and one historical occurence could give rise to dozens of dissenting opinions. One must only read the accounts of Thomas Bailey and Richard Hofstader, who are traditionalists, and Howard Zinn, who is labeled as a revisionist, to observe how differently various historians report the same event. History is not a sanctuary of certainty; in fact, its subjectiveness is an integral part of what makes it so fascinating to such a large number of people.</p><p>There is no refuge from uncertainty. With their discoveries, the scientist Werner Heisenberg and the mathematician Kurt G&ouml;del sealed the fate of absolutism and pushed humanity into an abyss of relativism and ambiguity. This abyss is a sun-drenched valley rather than a craggy chasm, for it is this uncertainty that will keep humanity hard at work formulating new discoveries for millennia.</p><p>Drawing (Ron Barrett)ed humanity into an abyss of relativism and ambiguity.
