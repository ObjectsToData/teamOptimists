All four of the city's research libraries -- the Science, Industry and Business Library at Madison and East 34th Street, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, the Schomburg Center for Black Culture on Malcolm X Boulevard and the central Humanities Social Science Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street -- will be open only Tuesdays through Saturdays as of early September, said Dr. Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library. They had been open six days a week.  ">

All four of the city's research libraries -- the Science, Industry and Business Library at Madison and East 34th Street, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, the Schomburg Center for Black Culture on Malcolm X Boulevard and the central Humanities Social Science Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street -- will be open only Tuesdays through Saturdays as of early September, said Dr. Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library.

                    <p>Most public libraries in Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx, including the majestic central library at West 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, will be cutting back to a five-day week over the coming months in response to recent citywide budget cuts, library officials said yesterday.</p><p>All four of the city's research libraries -- the Science, Industry and Business Library at Madison and East 34th Street, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, the Schomburg Center for Black Culture on Malcolm X Boulevard and the central Humanities Social Science Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street -- will be open only Tuesdays through Saturdays as of early September, said Dr. Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library. They had been open six days a week.</p><p>''The decision was taken with regret,'' said Dr. LeClerc, citing instructions from City Hall last month to withhold 7.5 percent from agency budgets. ''But we are indeed as a city and community facing some really tough times.''</p><p>In October, 67 of the central system's 85 branch libraries will gradually shift to a five-day week, as a hiring freeze cuts into available staff. In some cases, local libraries will stick to their reduced summer schedules. The Brooklyn Library, with its 60 branches, is considering similar cutbacks, a spokesperson said, while the Queens system has made other cuts in services. The three separate library systems are a historic legacy of New York's origins and have had to cut back their schedules during past fiscal crises, most recently in the early 1990's. Service at many branches was pared down to only two days a week during the worst of the crisis, but by 1993 service was back to at least five days a week at all branches.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. LeClerc said the new schedule cuts at libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island are now open-ended, and may even continue past June, into the city's next budget year. At a minimum, however, he said, one library in each of the three boroughs will remain open seven days a week, and another 15 libraries will stay on a six-day schedule to meet visitors' demands.</p><p>The prospect of losing more working hours at New York's research libraries -- where books and other materials can be used only on the premises -- caught many of the city's scholars by surprise.</p><p>''It is appalling and a sign of twisted priorities.'' said Mike Wallace, author and director of the Gotham Center for New York City History. ''The library is one of our greatest public resources which enhances activity for all sorts of people. This is a knowledge-based society, they tell us, and to be denied one of the great tools is a blow to the city, the society and the culture.''</p><p>The cutback in library service will also affect everyday users of branch libraries, considered by many generations of New Yorkers to be one of the city's greatest assets, with use at no cost.</p><p>''A library is a very expensive thing to run and the issue that rips my gut is that the New York library is open to everybody,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New York Historical Society. ''Nobody at the New York Public Library ever asks me for my ID card, like they do at the beaches in Greenwich, Connecticut.''</p><p>The city's library systems had already adjusted to a 5 percent reduction in budget that was part of the citywide spending plans adopted last June.</p><p>But then in late July, city agencies were instructed to withhold another 7.5 percent, which in the case of the New York Public Library -- the largest of the three systems -- amounted to $12.5 million, on top of the $2 million cut already implemented. The library's city-financed budget is $120 million, with an additional $100 million allocated each year from federal, state and private sources.</p><p>All three systems instituted a hiring freeze last fall, when the city budget woes first became apparent. The latest budget cuts are forcing further action.</p><p>''We are also looking at service hours and days, although the biggest thing is the cut in the materials budget,'' said Beth Weinstein, director of marketing and communications of the Brooklyn library.</p><p>Eleven of the 63 public libraries in Queens cut back to six days a week from seven last fall, said Joanne King, a spokeswoman for the Queens Borough system. Other cuts in services have already taken effect, including the elimination of a popular program that regularly dispatched librarians into Queens elementary and junior high schools, public and private.</p><p>''We have to partner in the recovery, too,'' Ms. King said. ''At this point, we are looking at doing our very best with what we got. We can't mourn our losses. We have to go forward.''</p><p>Dr. LeClerc said the latest instructions from City Hall indicated that it would be unlikely that the 7.5 percent cuts would be restored before the end of the 2002 budget year next June. Agencies were also advised to initiate the cuts immediately, to avoid more drastic action later, he said.</p><p>''We had no choice but to take this extremely seriously, as regretful as we might be,'' Dr. LeClerc said. ''The forecast for the city budget deficit for next year is as bad, if not worse, as this year. So I think we are looking at a two-year cycle of difficult times.''</p><p>So far, the city's libraries have avoided layoffs, but in the New York Public Library system, about 200 jobs have already been lost to attrition, which has already strained the system's management.</p><p>The library on Fifth Avenue at West 42nd Street, which was reduced to five-day weeks during other city fiscal crises, is even now operating on a schedule that provides limited access to part-time scholars. The library stays open until 7:30 p.m. two nights a week, but on those days it opens at 11 a.m., instead of 10 a.m. It is closed on Sundays.</p><p>In 1998, the library at 42nd Street completed a $15 million renovation of its 297-foot-long main reading room, which was the top attraction of the new library when it opened in 1911, and which has been used and praised by such famous writers as Edmund Wilson, Henry Miller, the poet Elizabeth Bishop and the historian Barbara Tuchman.</p><p>''The New York Public Library is a treasure and everyone who has worked on any topic of American history has worked there,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''It has been reborn in the last 20 years, and has been on an upward trajectory, and I just hope that this latest development is not a sign of its going in another direction.''</p><p>GOT BOOKS?</p><p>Less Library Time</p><p>MANHATTAN -- The Donnell Library Center on West 53rd Street will be open seven days a week. Starting next week, the four research libraries -- the Science, Industry and Business Library at Madison Avenue and East 34th Street; the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center; the Schomburg Center for Black Culture on Malcolm X Boulevard; and the central library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street -- will be open five days a week, Tuesday to Saturday. Seven branches will be open six days a week. The remaining branch libraries will eventually be open five days a week.</p><p>STATEN ISLAND -- The St. George Library Center on Central Avenue will remain open seven days a week.</p><p>Two branches will be open six days a week. The remaining branches will eventually be open five days a week.</p><p>BRONX -- The Fordham Library Center on Bainbridge Avenue will remain open seven days a week. Six branches will be open six days a week. The rest will eventually be open five days a week.</p><p>BROOKLYN (separate system) -- Cutbacks are being considered at 60 branches.</p><p>QUEENS BOROUGH (separate system) -- Eleven of 63 branches were cut back to six days a week from seven days last fall. Other services have also been trimmed.</p><p>Photo: Visitors will have less time to use the renovated main reading room in the central library at West 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
