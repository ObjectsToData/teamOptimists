Brock is a 32-year-old journalist who has taken the 60's counterculture credo that the personal is political and given it a whole new meaning -- describing Anita Hill as &quot;a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty&quot; and interviewing Arkansas state troopers about Bill Clinton's sex life. He'd invited to his place perhaps two dozen men and women in their 20's and 30's and early 40's who, like him, made their living trying to tear down the liberal establishment, or what remains of it.   There were editors from The American Spectator -- the country's most raucous journal of conservative opinion. It was in The Spectator that Brock published his savaging of Hill (later expanded into a best-selling book) and his &quot;troopergate&quot; allegations about the President. To judge by his elegant French-cuffed shirt, let alone the town house, his association with The Spectator hadn't hurt him.">

                    <p>IT WAS COCKTAIL HOUR ON THE OPENING DAY of the new, Republican-dominated Congress, and the long, chandelier-lighted parlor of David Brock's town house in Georgetown was filling up with exuberant young conservatives fresh from events on the Hill. Brock is a 32-year-old journalist who has taken the 60's counterculture credo that the personal is political and given it a whole new meaning -- describing Anita Hill as "a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty" and interviewing Arkansas state troopers about Bill Clinton's sex life. He'd invited to his place perhaps two dozen men and women in their 20's and 30's and early 40's who, like him, made their living trying to tear down the liberal establishment, or what remains of it.</p><p>There were editors from The American Spectator -- the country's most raucous journal of conservative opinion. It was in The Spectator that Brock published his savaging of Hill (later expanded into a best-selling book) and his "troopergate" allegations about the President. To judge by his elegant French-cuffed shirt, let alone the town house, his association with The Spectator hadn't hurt him.</p><p>In the center of the parlor, radiating the charged aura of the face-famous, stood P. J. O'Rourke, the Hunter Thompson of the right, drawing on a lethal-looking cigarillo; his withering dispatches in Rolling Stone, the biweekly that helped define the 60's counterculture, have made him something of a 90's frat-house hero. (I'd seen him on "Charlie Rose" the week before, making fun of starving Africans.) O'Rourke was deep in conversation with Andrew Ferguson, another conservative funny man. Ferguson had published a "memo" on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page a week after the election briefing reporters -- which to his mind means members of the liberal, Beltway-bunkered opinion elite -- on the curious new species known as "Republicans," who attend church not for chamber music concerts but for "services" and who drive "old cars, pickup trucks and vans," not Volvos. The article was called "Those Who Don't Get It."</p><p>Brock pointed out for me some of the others who, to the strains of Smashing Pumpkins and 10,000 Maniacs, were drinking and laughing and comparing Newt sightings. It may have been a more sedate affair than the Election Night bash Brock threw -- "I thought the windows were going to blow out when Rostenkowski conceded," he said -- but it was anything but staid. I had been prepared to encounter the kind of conservatives Norman Mailer memorably described as "people who went to their piano lessons when they were kids," but it wasn't that kind of crowd. They were bright. They'd had radical and unpopular ideas and had stuck to them.  And now they were carrying on like winners. America!</p>                </div>

                    <p>I was struck by the number of women on hand. There was Cathy Young, a 32-year-old columnist for The Detroit News who had come armed with brochures advertising the Women's Freedom Network, a conservative lobbying group formed in 1993 to seek "alternatives to both extremist ideological feminism and anti-feminist traditionalism." Later on I would meet Danielle Crittenden, the editor of The Women's Quarterly, a new Washington-based periodical edited for and by conservative-minded women; she was with her husband, David Frum -- a former Wall Street Journal editorial writer and the author of "Dead Right," which accuses the Reagan and Bush Administrations of not delivering on their promises to reduce the size of the Federal Government. Eager to get the word out about her new journal, Crittenden had sent me the first two issues, featuring articles like "Violence Against Taxpayers: Why the new $ 1.5 billion Violence Against Women Act won't protect women from violent crime, but will subject them to an assault of 'abuse experts,'" by Betsy Hart, a columnist for Scripps Howard News Service who was also at the party.</p><p>Another of Brock's guests that night was David Brooks, features editor of The Journal's editorial page -- the bulletin board of the New Right. A week after last November's election, Brooks had published on the page a short essay of his own titled "Meet the New Establishment," in which he heralded the ascent of a "new generation" of 30- and 40-something conservative opinion-makers: journalists, columnists, policy intellectuals and assorted other media and political types. The cultural revolution Brooks described had flickered alongside the electoral one that put Newt Gingrich in the Speaker's chair.</p><p>And who were the members of this New Establishment? Prominent among its ranks is William Kristol, the Republican strategist whose memo, faxed out to Republicans on Capitol Hill, launched the assault on President Clinton's health care plan. Then there is Lisa Schiffren, the former speech writer for Dan Quayle, who turned a sitcom character, Murphy Brown, into a weapon in the right's attack on single motherhood. Myron Magnet of New York's influential conservative think tank, the Manhattan Institute, is a member, too; his 1993 book, "The Dream and the Nightmare," a detailed critique of the welfare system, earned him a fan letter from Gingrich and helped make welfare reform a Republican priority. The notion of political correctness, now a staple of radio talk shows and the news weeklies, was first defined and ridiculed by the cultural critics Roger Kimball and Dinesh D'Souza, both of whom are key players of the New Establishment. D'Souza's next book, on the politics of race, will -- like so many conservative books these days, including "The Bell Curve" -- be published by Adam Bellow, editorial director of the Free Press, this establishment's most important house. Then there are the people who publicize these books and the ideas they promote -- people like Brooks and Brock and James Golden, a producer of "Rush Limbaugh" who also has his own nationally syndicated radio show. These young men and women are, in effect, a new conservative opinion elite, a counter-counterculture.</p>                </div>
