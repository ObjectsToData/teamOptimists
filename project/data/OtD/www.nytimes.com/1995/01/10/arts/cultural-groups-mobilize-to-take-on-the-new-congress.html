    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Alarmed by growing attacks on Federal support for the arts, cultural groups around the country are mobilizing to press their case directly to the avowedly hostile House Republican leadership. Their message: The arts don't cost; they earn.    The effort to sell the arts as not just balm for the soul but as a boon to local economies drew representatives of some 50 national arts and humanities groups to a meeting last week in Washington, where they formed a new &quot;cultural advocacy&quot; coalition. Another group set up a 900 telephone number to raise money for messages to Senators and Representatives. The chairman of the President's Council on Arts and the Humanities, John Brademas, said yesterday that he would make his own appeal later this week.">

He and Congressional allies have vowed to pare if not end the subsidies doled out by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is to distribute $167.4 million this year, down from a high in 1979 of what today would be more than $300 million. Other Government financing programs for humanities and museums are also under critical scrutiny.</p>                </div>

                    <p>There are additional uncertainties in New York State, where the new Republican Governor, George E. Pataki, has yet to put his own stamp on the State Council on the Arts, either formally reappointing the long-serving chairwoman, Kitty Carlisle Hart, or naming a successor.</p><p>"Everybody's nervous," said Robert T. Buck, director of the Brooklyn Museum, which has received more than $2 million from Washington over the last two years for special programs and exhibits. Though the grant is only a small part of the museum's $17.5 million annual operating budget, it is considered vital. "We are counting on these monies," Mr. Buck said. "We are planning our projects with their support."</p><p>In an effort at solidarity, representatives of the American Association of Museum Directors and about 50 other arts, civic and labor organizations from the United Conference of Mayors to Opera America and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. met last week at the offices of the National Assembly of Local Arts Agencies to plan strategy.</p><p>"We're sharing what our Congressional friends are thinking, and figuring out collective ways of communicating," said Bob Lynch, president of the assembly and a former college instructor in poetry and writing.</p><p>He said the coalition would portray the arts as a $37 billion industry employing 1.3 million people, or 1.5 percent of the work force, and generating tax revenues of $3.4 billion. Although nonprofit arts groups are routinely misperceived as subsisting primarily on charity, he said, they actually generate 60 percent of their budgets with cash sales: tickets, T-shirts and the like. Most of the rest is raised privately. Even those groups that are subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts average grants valued at less than 2 percent of their budgets.</p><p>"Those are conservative Republican principles," said Mr. Lynch, whose 3,800-member assembly is coordinating but not directing the coalition.</p><p>Another umbrella lobbying group, the Arts Alliance, last week set up a fund-raising toll number -- (900) 370-9000 -- with a message soliciting money for a campaign to sway Congress with the same economic argument.</p><p>"If the curtain doesn't go up, restaurants and taxis suffer and printers don't get paid," said the alliance's executive director, Judy Golub.</p><p>Similarly, the American Council for the Arts, another lobbying group, has been calling news organizations with figures on the economic impact of the arts.</p><p>Leading figures in arts philanthropy and education are also lending support to the effort. Though Mr. Brademas heads the President's arts committee -- a citizens and Government advisory panel to stimulate private and public support of the arts -- he said he had also been working on his own to organize "friends of the arts" in support of the two national endowments (arts and humanities) and the Institute of Museum Services, which helps defray operating expenses. Mr. Brademas, who has served as a Representative from Indiana and as president of New York University, said he would speak out on the issue in a program on Thursday at the National Gallery of Art.</p><p>For his part, Mr. Gingrich has said that while he supports free exercise of the arts, he does not believe that they should be taxpayer subsidized. In fact, he says, artists would be freer without Federal involvement.</p><p>Even managers, benefactors and trustees of large arts institutions that receive proportionately small Federal grants deplored cutbacks or a cutoff, saying the contributions stimulate other giving.</p><p>"The N.E.A. validates the arts in America; it's the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval," said Ardis Krainik, general director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which is getting some $600,000 from the Government this year toward its $30 million operating budget. She recalled that a large cut in arts funds was also sought when President Reagan took office, but that Republican allies on the boards of arts groups proved persuasive in rolling back the effort.</p><p>Martin E. Segal, chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts and former chairman of Lincoln Center, said arts groups were best advised to make their case for Federal funds through influential members of their boards rather than by scattershot lobbying of Congress, and he indicated that such efforts were already under way.</p><p>The president of Lincoln Center, Nathan Leventhal, said that although the Federal contribution made up a bare 1 percent of the performing arts complex's $340 million budget (which is roughly double the arts endowment's entire budget), it helped. Besides, he said, the endowment's contribution amounts to 66 cents a year for every American. "We spend more on military bands than on the arts in this country."</p><p>Like a number of others, Mr. Leventhal attributed the anti-financing backlash to recent controversial artworks that offended religious and conservative sensibilities.</p><p>Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, said: "I can't believe that out of thousands and thousands of grants they would latch on to two or three they found objectionable, whoever 'they' are."</p><p>"What happened after the $750 toilet seats?" she said in reference to military overcharges. "Did we attempt to shut down the Pentagon?"</p><p>To one major recipient of Federal arts and humanities grants, WNET/ Channel 13 in New York, one of the nation's largest public broadcasting stations, the threatened cutback or cutoff was particularly ominous.</p><p>Although the station gets about a fourth of its $100 million budget directly or indirectly from Washington, by its nature it cannot fight for funds, said its president, William Baker.</p><p>"Our strength is our weakness," he said. "We're very apolitical. We're not left or right and we feel uncomfortable at lobbying for anything, including ourselves."</p><p>The station could not be self-sustaining, Mr. Baker said, because its programs were "not economically viable." Fully half the schedule consists of children's programming, he said, and 9,000 schools a day used WNET programs in their curriculum. Public broadcasting has been threatened before, he said, but never so directly.</p><p>For all the concern among arts groups about Republican leaders in Washington, there was praise for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has maintained city arts financing even in the face of severe budget problems. Ellen V. Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, said that Republicans in New York City had been "extremely sensitive and highly sympathetic to the arts."</p><p>Photos: Robert T.
