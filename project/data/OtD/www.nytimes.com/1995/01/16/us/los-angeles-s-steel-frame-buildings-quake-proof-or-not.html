                    <p>In the year since the deadly Northridge earthquake, this disaster-hardened city has become aware of a frightening new danger: the fragility of the steel-frame buildings that at first seemed to have survived the shaking unscathed.</p><p>And despite months of urgent laboratory testing as the extent of their mostly hidden cracks and fissures became clear, no one yet knows how to make the weakened buildings safer.</p><p>Worries that the buildings could fracture or topple have been compounded by new warnings from seismologists that particularly strong or unusual ground motions in a future earthquake could threaten structures previously thought to be relatively safe. Suddenly, one of the most earthquake-ready cities in the world finds it may face a greater danger of damage than planners had imagined.</p><p>As 4:31 A.M. on Tuesday -- the anniversary of the earthquake in the city's Northridge neighborhood -- approaches, a host of government agencies have issued reports on an extensive recovery effort involving multibillion-dollar Federal aid packages.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But the city, in its own comprehensive report, acknowledged that it was stumped by the problems with the steel-frame buildings, which are considered the most earthquake-proof because of steel's ability to bend and sway but not break.</p><p>"Even though nothing collapsed, the performance of the frames and the connections wasn't what was expected," said Nestor Iwankiw, a structural engineer who is studying the problem of steel-frame buildings for the city. "We don't know why certain things happened and didn't happen."</p><p>More than 92,000 buildings were damaged in the earthquake, which measured 6.8 on ground-motion scales and caused 57 deaths and 8,000 injuries, according to the city's tally. Most of the damaged buildings were brick, concrete or wood. The city's 1,000 steel-frame buildings, able to bend and sway with the tremors, seemed at first to have withstood the shaking as they had been designed to.</p><p>Then steel workers in the hills above the city reported an unexpected problem. There were fissures between columns and beams in two unfinished buildings at the Getty Center for the History of Art and Humanities, which was under construction at the time of the quake, said Karl C. Deppe, an official with the city's Department of Buildings and Safety.</p><p>"This helped to clue us in to the fact that there was a real problem," he said. "Two engineers had also found buildings with uncommon fractures, and we said, 'Gee, this is unusual.' But as it unfortunately turned out, this was not unusual at all."</p><p>Inspectors began studying the 300 steel-frame buildings in the hard-hit areas of West Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, of which 30 or 40 are skyscrapers. In painstaking work that involved peeling away walls and outer materials, engineers found that as many as 75 percent of the more than 100 buildings they inspected had suffered cracks and tears to their frames, primarily at the welded connections in their joints.</p><p>When the damage was discovered, two of the buildings were evacuated by their owners as a precaution, said Richard Holguin, chief of the buildings bureau of the Department of Buildings and Safety.</p><p>The damaged buildings ranged in height from 3 to 26 stories and were built as long ago as 1963 and as recently as 1993, he said.</p><p>"Most of these buildings show no internal or external damage," Mr. Holguin said. "In some of them, you are able to get a kind of inkling of damage because the elevators don't work properly or because the building is out of plumb," leaning infinitesimally to one side.</p><p>What inspectors are mostly finding, he said, is fractures in the welds or sometimes in the steel columns themselves at the points where the beams connect. A 20-story building, he said, might have 500 to 600 such connections, each of which costs $1,500 to $4,000 to inspect.</p><p>The City Council is set to consider a bill that would require these inspections at certain buildings, and call for repairs as needed.</p><p>"The problem," said Judith J. Steele, a legislative analyst for the City Council, "is that we can't tell them how to do the repairs." Her office's one-year report hopefully suggests that by the time the inspections have been done, scientists may have devised a repair strategy.</p><p>Mr. Iwankiw, who is director of research and codes at the American Institute of Steel Construction, an industry group based in Chicago, said engineering studies at the University of Texas had determined that standard welding repairs would not be sufficient.</p><p>He said the tests had shown that the addition of heavy steel plates above and below each joint would offer the needed reinforcement but that this appeared impractical in buildings that had already been completed.</p><p>A number of other variables remained to be tested, he said, including the reliability of joints in buildings of various sizes and the magnitude of an earthquake that would threaten them.</p><p>"The problems have been seen in the connection region itself, in the welds, the shape, the design concept of the connection and the workmanship," Mr. Iwankiw said. "All kinds of things are going on."</p><p>One of the most worrisome variables is the motion of the ground in an earthquake. Seismologists said the unusually rapid upward thrust of the Northridge earthquake -- rather than side-to-side shaking -- might have caused some of the unexpected damage. In addition, two studies released last week warned that far stronger jolts could strike the Los Angeles area and level even the most earthquake-proof new buildings.</p><p>Nabih Youssef, a structural engineer on the state Building Standards Commission, said it was less likely that the damaged buildings would "come tumbling down" in another strong earthquake than that they would be seriously damaged, with ceilings and walls collapsing.</p><p>At highest risk, he said, are tall, slender buildings, or buildings of irregular design, or buildings with hidden defects, or buildings with a tall first story and a minimum of reinforcement.</p><p>"Fortunately, that represents a small percentage of buildings in the area," he said. "But the hazard definitely exists, especially if we get a long earthquake with lots of motion cycles."</p>                </div>
