    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  IT was a very good year for Boots, discovered by Carol Chesler last Independence Day homeless on Houston Street. With the help of a friend and a homeless young man named Mike, Ms. Chesler brought the jolly, fat black dog with the white forepaws home, and eventually matched him with a Union Square Greenmarket farm couple. Now, when Carl and Ginny Jensen bring their jellies and baked goods to the city on Fridays and Saturdays, Ms. Chesler walks Boots. It always makes her smile, though Boots is acting more and more as if he's doing her a favor.   Boots is important to her. She made a lot of new friends while finding him a home in a year in which her old cat, Sundance, died; her favorite politician, Mario M. Cuomo, was defeated, and Mike never found a home of his own.">

Now, when Carl and Ginny Jensen bring their jellies and baked goods to the city on Fridays and Saturdays, Ms. Chesler walks Boots. It always makes her smile, though Boots is acting more and more as if he's doing her a favor.</p><p>Boots is important to her. She made a lot of new friends while finding him a home in a year in which her old cat, Sundance, died; her favorite politician, Mario M. Cuomo, was defeated, and Mike never found a home of his own.</p><p>"Mike says, 'Shelters are not for me,' " reported Ms. Chesler, a column certified coper. "It makes me sad, knowing he's sleeping in doorways around the city. I don't think this is going to be a good year for people who need health care, social services, places to live. What am I looking forward to in 1995? I want to build up my copy-editing and proof-reading business, especially in medical texts, and I have to figure out what to do with these two rescued kittens, and I'd like to know where are all the men in their 40's and 50's who want to meet women their own age."</p><p>It was a comeback year for Ruth K. Goldberg (also certified) of Greenwich Village. She had spent November '93 in the hospital undergoing a difficult hip replacement, and November '94 as a Global Volunteer in Siedlce, Poland, teaching English to two classes of fifth graders and a class of female provincial bureaucrats. Ms. Goldberg had an ulterior motive; She wanted to confront and dispel her prejudices against Poles. Her late husband's family had come from a nearby village, and like more than three million Polish Jews died in the Holocaust.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"When I went to Auschwitz, I just caved in," said Ms. Goldberg, an 82-year-old retired schoolteacher. "Reading and hearing about it is one thing, but seeing the ovens and human hair is shattering. I made it a point to let everyone know I was Jewish, and I encountered no adverse reaction, not in Siedlce or Krakow or Warsaw, where I saw a marvelous staging of 'Fiddler on the Roof' in Polish. It got a standing ovation."</p><p>Her fifth graders were "kids, like any kids, I get attached to kids." They didn't have telephones, but they did have satellite dishes that received Bart Simpson. From her older students she learned about Poland's good medical care and social programs and the "intrusiveness" of the Roman Catholic Church. She liked the people and country, and on returning was struck anew by New York's diversity, which she says is its strength and vulnerability.</p><p>This year she expects to reflect on the adventure while saving up for her next. The trip cost $3,000. A fan of Sylvia Ashton-Warner's novels, Ms. Goldberg has been thinking about New Zealand, perhaps even in 1995. She is particularly interested in the cultural and political clash of the indigenous Maoris and the white settlers.</p><p>It was the 18th and best year for the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped and its founder, the Jesuit brother, Rick Curry -- actor, director, impresario, baker and Certified Coper. The workshop doubled its student enrollment to 72 and had 10 smash cabaret Sundays at Don't Tell Mama. There was a major sponsorship dinner, and Edward Albee became an important booster. Within two months, Brother Rick expects to make the down payment on an old opera house in Belfast, Me., that will become a weekend and then summer headquarters.</p><p>"People think salvation for the disabled is in computers or some other physical skills, but it's really in developing imagination, because there are no barriers there," said Brother Rick, who was born with one arm. "Disability gives you a focus, a center -- I'm not suggesting you should go get one, by the way -- and the humanities, the liberal arts, give you ways to fly with it. Logistics and transportation have always been our major problems, and I just tingle thinking about a week or two working with the students while in residence in Maine."</p><p>Brother Rick's first book, "The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking," with an introduction by Laura ("Like Water for Chocolate") Escovil, will be published in June by HarperCollins. Proceeds will go to the theater. At year's end, in Rick's Broome Street studio, blind students chopped walnuts and apricots and wheelchair students wrapped fresh bread for delivery as Rick and a one-legged cook baked 200 loaves presold at the dinner. When I talked to Brother Rick, he was cleaning up, which reminded him of an old Jesuit joke he offered for the new year.</p><p>"A 17-year-old novice wants to leave the convent because she's pregnant. The Mother Superior says, 'Go in peace, my child.' Next day a 30-year-old nun says she's pregnant. Mother Superior says, 'Go in peace my child.' When a 70-year-old nun wants to leave, the Mother Superior asks, 'Why?' The nun answers: 'There are only two things going on in this convent, and I'm doing all the dusting.'
