Alf Landon, the Republican nominee in 1936. &quot;We need a President who shares our values, embraces our agenda and who will lead the fight for the fundamental change America chose last November.&quot;">

His failure to do so in 1988 contributed to his loss in the crucial New Hampshire primary.</p><p>Unlike in his earlier efforts, the 71-year-old Mr. Dole enters this race as the overwhelming front-runner in the early polls. Rather than lash out at his rivals, he sought to strike a Presidential manner, resisting his usual acerbic quips and saving his swipes for President Clinton.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"If we are truly to rein in Government," said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, "we must have a President who is more than a clever apologist for the status quo. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran for President as the candidate of change. In 1996, he will seek re-election as a candidate pledged to prevent change at all cost."</p><p>In taking his final stab at the Presidential nomination, Mr. Dole joined a Republican field that includes Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the columnist Patrick J. Buchanan and Alan Keyes, a former State Department official. Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana are expected to announce their candidacies.</p><p>To drive home his dual themes of states' rights and small-town values, Mr. Dole picked the Capitol in Topeka for his backdrop. Topeka was a change of scenery from his hometown of Russell, where he began his doomed candidacies in 1980 and 1988.</p><p>Today, foul weather forced the event inside, and grounded the squadron of vintage World War II planes that were to have flown over the capital in a nod to Mr. Dole's well-known record as a war hero.</p><p>Still, working through the night, Dole aides sought to make it a festive event. They placed hand-painted signs by the stage that read, "We love you, Uncle Bob," and, "Dole, Heartland Hero, 1996," and closed the event by releasing balloons from the ceiling.</p><p>Though he repeatedly spoke of change and a need to decentralize a Government that he said was "too large, too remote, too unresponsive and too undemocratic," Mr. Dole is hardly new to politics and hardly an outsider. He has served in Congress for 34 years, in the House and in the Senate since 1969. He is a Main Street Republican who built his career on compromise and consensus, not on challenging the status quo.</p><p>The problem is even thornier now for Mr. Dole, who as majority leader must compromise and negotiate in the legislative arena.</p><p>But today, Mr. Dole sounded more like the ideologically driven conservatives who are setting the agenda in the House. In his announcement in the 1988 race, for example, Mr. Dole vowed to cut the budget deficit but did not rule out raising taxes as part of such a package. His ambivalence on taxes contributed to his crushing loss to George Bush in the New Hampshire primary -- a defeat from which he never recovered.</p><p>In Topeka, Mr. Dole quickly put to rest questions about his stand on taxes. "Let me make one fundamental belief crystal clear," he said. "We can cut taxes and balance the budget all at the same time. Middle-class families are forced to send too much of their hard-earned money to Washington. We should provide a tax credit for children and remove the marriage penalty to strengthen our families."</p><p>At his second stop this afternoon, at the Exeter, N.H., town hall, where he repeated his speech, aides to Mr. Dole distributed a signed "taxpayer protection pledge" that was similar to one he refused to sign in 1988.  After New Hampshire, he, his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, and his daughter, Robin, went on to New York for a $1 million fund-raising event. Mr. Dole's aides said they had New York locked up, with endorsements from that state's top Republican officials, except Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p><p>As part of his call for curbing the Federal Government, Mr. Dole asserted to the crowd here that four "ineffective, burdensome and meddlesome departments" should be dismantled: the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Energy and Commerce.</p><p>Nor did he spare the arts. "We spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the endowments for the arts and humanities," he said. "Why is the Federal Government in the culture business? In this explosion of the information age, why do we have a Corporation for Public Broadcasting?"</p><p>Aides to Mr. Dole said the points about values and reining in Government registered especially well in tests with groups of potential Republican voters who were asked about versions of the speech in recent days. That helps explain why Mr. Dole repeated the word values nine times in the speech today.</p><p>Mr. Dole gave short shrift to the personal story of how he was seriously wounded 50 years ago this week, in World War II, and to his roots in small-town Kansas -- stories that were at the center of his announcement that last time he ran.</p><p>Advisers said they were most concerned that Mr. Dole come off a vigorous and focused and that his appearance not encourage questions that he may be too old to run. Mr. Dole rested up at his condominium in Florida over the weekend for the weeklong announcement tour.</p><p>For months, Mr. Dole had been telling people that he deserved the nomination essentially because he had the experience and it was his turn. Today, he touched only in passing at his experience, citing it only as he closed the speech. "I have been tested and tested and tested in many ways," he said. "I am not afraid to lead, and I know the way."</p><p>As part of this leadership, Mr. Dole, spoke of his role on the national stage and warned that the nation should not abdicate its sovereignty to the United Nations. "We must stop placing the agenda of the United Nations before the interests of the United States."</p><p>At his stop in New Hampshire, Mr. Dole announced an important endorsement from Representative Bill Zeliff, who had been toying with backing Mr. Alexander. Mr. Zeliff was named the Dole campaign chairman in New Hampshire.</p><p>Photos: Senator Bob Dole in Topeka, Kan., after announcing that he was joining the race for the White House.
