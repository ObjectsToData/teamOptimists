But on the two-way street of communication, a happy symbiosis is achieved when a writer tosses up an offbeat usage or a puzzling word and the working reader figures it out and savors it.

                    <p>WHEN A WORKing writer tries out an unfamiliar word, a working reader feels the need to notice, and to do something about understanding it. If the writer is merely showing off erudition, or if he challenges the reader too often, he will lose his audience in a hurry; no reader is obligated to decipher a code. But on the two-way street of communication, a happy symbiosis is achieved when a writer tosses up an offbeat usage or a puzzling word and the working reader figures it out and savors it.</p><p>Recently I was reading, and disagreeing, with a New York Times editorial about standards for teaching history being promulgated by a panel of historians at the behest of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>"Most of what annoys conservatives can be remediated," the editorial writer asserted. As a working reader, I rose to the bait: why not the simpler, more easily understood remedied? I looked up remediated in the Random House Unabridged and Webster's New World, and could find only the noun, remediation, which W.N.W. defined as an Americanism used in education, "the act or process of remedying or overcoming learning disabilities or problems." The most familiar use of the word is in remedial reading.</p><p>Why did the writer choose remediate? According to the lexicographer Cynthia Barnhart, working on her fourth dictionary of new English, that verb was first back-formed in this sense in 1954 in the Britannica Book of the Year; remediated was defined there as "subjected to remedial education" and is now firmly fixed in education jargon. The Times editorial writer used it, I think, to give a classroom connotation to the fix possible for the legislative proposal.</p>                </div>

                    <p>That was nice coloration of prose; though the writer's position, to my thinking, was harebrained, the demand placed on me as a working reader by the editorial writer was legitimate, and the result of my search for meaning was satisfying. (I have not called my colleague for fear of hearing, "Yeah, the word I meant was remedied.")</p><p>Now put the shoe on the other foot. In a political harangue, I used the word kak-handed to mean "clumsy." Though I could not find it in any dictionary, I felt confident in using the term, though I knew it would be unfamiliar to most readers, because it's a word in use: I can still hear the late Albert Julius of London using that snippet of dialect to describe my lack of manual dexterity. My guess was that it was related to the Greek word for "bad," as in kakistocracy -- "government by the worst people." It might be related to kaka or caca, baby talk for dirty stuff, also found in the Latin cacare, "to void excrement."</p><p>Fortunately, I had a working reader. My spelling had thrown me off. "Re your kak-handed," Stanley H. Brown of New York wrote, "two of my dictionaries -- American Heritage and the Oxford English Dictionary -- spell it cack-handed, and neither gives your spelling as an alternative. What is your source on this spelling? As another autodidact word-maven, I am most interested."</p><p>The self-taught Mr. Brown (that's how to subtly save a nonworking reader from guilt for failing to look up autodidact) steered me to the illumination of the O.E.D. Supplement: "cack-handed . . . dialect or colloquial. Also cag-, keck-handed.  [ See? That's my source. ]  Left-handed; ham-handed, clumsy, awkward." First recorded use was 1854, and in steady use to this day. Houghton Mifflin's American Heritage Dictionary, 3d edition (2,140 pages, a great buy at $45), notes the word is "chiefly British," and speculates it may come from the Old Norse keikr, "bent backwards," akin to the Danish keite, "left-handed."</p><p>Before I first inflicted this word on an unwary public, an alert editor at The New York Times News Service, Pat Ryan, queried me about its meaning. I told her what little I knew about it at the time. To avert a deluge of "And what the hell is this supposed to mean?" from paying clients, she sent out this advisory to other editors: "Mr. Safire sometimes uses obscure words in his column to tease his readers, arouse their curiosity or get them thinking about language. He welcomes readers' inquiries and comments. We request that client papers preserve the reference and make no changes in the column."</p><p>And so we all now have a handle on a useful bit of dialect, which is what happens when writers and readers work together. Of course, it's easiest in a language column like this, with participation urged and expected, but it also takes place when any writer gets up the gumption to assume at least some readers are willing to work, and those working readers return the compliment by accepting the writer's challenge. Draco vs. Stentor</p><p>Draconian, an adjective based on the somewhat severe disciplinary practices of the seventh-century B.C. Athenian lawgiver Draco, is coming on strong. For a long time, it cooked along in data bases at a rate of about 60 a year, then jumped to double that in 1994 in reporting about the caning practices of the Government of Singapore. My editor at The Times Magazine, Michael Molyneux, reports that the high frequency of Draconian sightings continues into this year.</p><p>Draco had the good idea that punishment should be meted out only by the state and not by the vendetta of private groups. To put the law across, he simplified it: all crimes were punishable only by the state, and that punishment would be death. No shades of gray; one size fits all. From this harsh discipline we get the adjective Draconian. (A legislator named Solon later eased up on the sentences, which is why we call our compassionate Congresspersons solons.)</p><p>Which brings up the question: Why, if the frequency of this heavy-hitting adjective is increasing and nobody remembers who Draco was in the first place, do we still capitalize the word?</p><p>We don't capitalize solons when we are writing about our legislators. Nor do we capitalize stentorian, "extremely loud, booming," to describe the voice that fills a room without benefit of electronic amplification, an adjective whose eponym is Stentor, a Greek herald in the Trojan War who the poet Homer claimed in the "Iliad" had the voice of 50 men.</p><p>So let's drop the d on draconian. And now to use it in a sentence: In an article about the decision of Parris Glendening, new Governor of Maryland, to hang the oil portrait of one of his predecessors, Spiro T. Agnew, in the state's historic hall, I erred in calling Governor Glendening a Republican. The following message was left for me by a Times clerk: "Chuck Porcairi, Governor Glendening's deputy press secretary, called to let you know that the Governor is a Democrat, and that there will be a hanging ceremony to which you will be invited."</p><p>How's that for draconian?</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
