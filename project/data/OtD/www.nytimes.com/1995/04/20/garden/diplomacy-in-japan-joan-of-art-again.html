                    <p>AS she drove through the iron gates that guard the entrance of the American Ambassador's residence, Joan Adams Mondale gently juggled armloads of paper-clad bundles. In each was a piece of art destined for its private quarters, the new home of Mrs. Mondale and her husband, Walter -- the former Vice President and current Ambassador to Japan.</p><p>"I was Joan of Art before, and now I am Joan of Art again," Mrs. Mondale said with a laugh, referring to her nickname during the Carter years, when she filled the Vice President's mansion with pottery and contemporary American art.</p><p>Once again, Joan Mondale, 64, is in her element. An amateur artist herself, she has taken advantage of the fact that in Japan, no formal visit is made without an exchange of calling cards and gifts -- and the more thoughtful the gift, the better the Japanese appreciate it. Mrs. Mondale presented the Mayor of Kyoto with one of her own bowls, executed in the rough-hewn Mashiko style, a Japanese folk technique that she learned from Warren MacKenzie, a master potter in Stillwater, Minn. Word has it that the Mayor was touched, and that other Japanese dignitaries would be disappointed not to receive a handmade gift.</p><p>"I'll have to work hard during our summer stay in Minnesota, just to replenish my supply," Mrs. Mondale said, her malleable face breaking into a broad smile.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This week, however, her focus is on getting her house ready for its opening festivities -- the first official party will be held on April 24.</p><p>Completed in 1930, the Ambassador's residence was the first built for that purpose by the United States and, at $1.25 million, was so costly that it was derisively known as Hoover's Folly. Although the stucco wall surrounding it is topped with traditional Japanese tiles, the 20-room house is an engaging mongrel, a curious mix of Mediterranean arches and Moorish flourishes.</p><p>Harold Van Buren Magonigle, an obscure New York architect who specialized in schools and other government structures, was responsible for the odd design. The residence's gardens, just over an acre of roses and hedges, were designed by Antonin Raymond, who was brought to Japan in 1919 by Frank Lloyd Wright to oversee the construction of the Imperial Hotel.</p><p>The years had taken their toll. "It was awful -- empty, cold and ugly," Mrs. Mondale said. "The roof leaked and the paint was chipped." Maureen B. Murphy of the interior-design and furnishings branch of the State Department led an $8.1 million renovation, while the Mondales lived nearby.</p><p>Mrs. Mondale had little input into the design of the public rooms -- Government standards prevailed -- but she is making her presence felt in the art, which is on loan from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, through the State Department's Art in Embassies program.</p><p>Below the spiral staircase in the entrance hang lithographs from Robert Rauschenberg's "Drawings for Dante's Inferno," in which Virgil is seen in the guise of Adlai Stevenson. Nearby is a fish lamp by Frank Gehry. In other parts of the house are Jim Dine's "Yellow Robe" and a Chuck Close portrait of the composer Philip Glass.</p><p>Setting down her packages on the marble floor, Mrs. Mondale walked to the living room. Without the animating presence of the dozens of guests that the Mondales expect to entertain weekly, the room feels cavernous, its scale underscored by 20-foot columns that stretch to a wooden cove ceiling that resembles those in Kyoto's Nijo Castle.</p><p>The decor is American prosperous, but the art has a definite, often witty charge. As if silently commenting on the unadventuresome surroundings, Mrs. Mondale has placed a series of Ektacolor prints by Richard Prince, images of plushly bland living-room ensembles published originally as advertisements that he rephotographed. Art with a social subtext takes center stage in the dining room: muted black-and-white photographs by Max Yavno of children at play and people at work in poor American neighborhoods.</p><p>"I wanted art not only by established and known artists, but also by emerging artists," said Mrs. Mondale, the author of "Politics in Art" and a former honorary chairwoman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities. Among the projects she supports locally is Faret Tachikawa, a public art program including works of 92 artists from all over the world placed in Tachikawa, a suburb of Tokyo.</p><p>Mrs. Mondale carried her packages to the private quarters upstairs, which have been decorated in yellows, greens and pinks by Carleton B. Varney of Dorothy Draper &amp; Company in New York. Mr. Varney is an old friend of Mrs. Mondale, whose style he approvingly calls "Minnesota country and contemporary."</p><p>In the sitting room, a Frank Stella print is unwrapped -- the Mondales' own, not a loan. It will go over the room's fireplace. From another package comes Mr. Mondale's treasured photograph of his fishing shack in Canada -- destined for the study.</p><p>Outside the residence, the garden is also getting some needed attention. A lotus-pool fountain functions again and an ancient pine tree -- propped up with posts -- is making a comeback. Near a bamboo fence grow trees planted by the wives of previous envoys, including the now-blooming cherry tree that was the legacy of the wife of the prewar Ambassador, Joseph Grew.</p><p>In a few weeks, Mrs. Mondale confided, she will be planting her own -- an American pink dogwood. Ambassadors, and even the art on the walls, will come and go, but this legacy of Joan Mondale will live on.</p><p>Photos: Joan Mondale, with bowls she made and a Chuck Close portrait, in the renovated Ambassador's house in Tokyo (shown from the outside, below).
