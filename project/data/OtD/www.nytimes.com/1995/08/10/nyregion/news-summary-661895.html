A8  FORCED LABOR IN BRAZIL  Reports of forced labor have grown so numerous in Brazil that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has opened an investigation.

A1  SERBS FLEE CROATIA  Thousands of defeated and visibly frightened Serbs streamed out of Croatia, jeered by crowds of bitter Croats who lined the roads to witness the latest chapter in the Balkans' ethnic division. A8  FORCED LABOR IN BRAZIL  Reports of forced labor have grown so numerous in Brazil that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has opened an investigation. A1  CORRUPTION IN CHINA  China's anti-corruption campaign is netting bigger fish than ever before, but officials and Western businessmen say it indicates corruption's pervasiveness rather than determination to stop graft. A3  SLOW DEATH IN LAOS  The bombs that the United States dropped over the vast, mountainous stretches of Laos's border with Vietnam continue to kill and maim more than two decades later.  A12  MEXICAN DONATIONS DEFENDED  Mexico's governing party acknowledged yesterday that the chairman of the country's largest airline supported the party financially last year, but insisted that the donations were all legal.

A1  A TURNING AWAY OF FRIENDS  Federal prosecutors building their case against Timothy J.

A1  ONE HOT PROPERTY  Netscape Communications, an Internet software company, made a stunning debut, jumping $30.25 a share to close at $58.25. The trading showed how the rush to commercialize the Internet has created an investor frenzy. A1  A RISE IN THE NUMBER OF INMATES  In a comprehensive report on the scope of law-enforcement network, the Government said the number of Americans under the control of the criminal justice system reached five million last year.  A14  AIRPORT SECURITY TIGHTENED  Airports began stepping up security as the Government took steps to counter the increased threat of terrorist attacks after the arrests in New York City of Palestinians accused of terrorism.  A14  A SETBACK FOR SIMPSON TEAM  The judge in the O. J. Simpson case ruled that Mr. Simpson's lawyers had failed to prove that a leak to news organizations was material to the case, and could not either obtain a police report on the leak or ask two reporters about it.  A16  DIABETES GENE IS DISCOVERED  Scientists have discovered the first human gene associated with adult onset diabetes, a disorder related to obesity.
