An informal survey of some on the barricades suggests that while the battle to save the N.E.A. was often scattershot, the agency never stood a chance once it became the designated scourge of the religious right.</p><p>There were some heroes, including, arguably, Ms. Griffith; the literary fellowships she defended to the Speaker may be the only individual grants to survive the purge. Among others who made a difference: Isaac Stern, an energetic lobbyist; Jodie Foster, who made a public-service announcement, and Michael Greene, the music-industry executive who turned the Grammy Awards show into an N.E.A. jamboree.</p><p>But George Searchinger, a documentary film maker, had a real point when he wrote a letter to The Times last month asking, "Where are the television network leaders, the movie moguls, the opera impresarios, the great commentators now that we need them?" The powerful TV and movie industry barons whose products are often made by N.E.A. alumni were too apathetic to speak up. Press commentary on the N.E.A., especially on Sunday TV talk shows, was often scant and flip, as if the only thing at stake were the future of chamber music.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Robert Bennett, a conservative Utah Republican who was among those trying to improve the N.E.A.'s lot in the Senate yesterday, says that classy cultural icons might have made the case on the Hill better than flashy Hollywood stars associated with liberal causes. But such figures were only intermittently mobilized. The arts world has its advocacy groups, but it is too poor and compartmentalized to create a focused Washington presence to match the National Rifle Association.</p><p>And what about all those Republican fat cats who sit on the boards of N.E.A.-funded institutions? The president of the Metropolitan Museum, William Luers, who joined with blue-chip business and cultural leaders to form Americans United to Save the Arts and Humanities, found that in the end "not enough of them had the courage to call Newt on this."</p><p>The dispirited Mr. Luers, like others I spoke to, also soon discovered that the endowments' fate was not tied to "a rational, intelligent debate over what the arts and humanities do" in any case. No argument -- esthetic, economic, educational or even patriotic -- could save the N.E.A. as long as it was on the religious right's hit list.</p><p>You need only read the American Family Association's fund-raising letters to see that the assault on the N.E.A. was never about the Federal role in the arts or the budget; the agency was merely a symbolic target. The actual targets? It's not happenstance that virtually every artist demonized in such mailings is either black, gay or outspokenly female -- or better still, some combination thereof -- even if that requires digging up artists long gone and never directly funded by the N.E.A., like the undying Robert Mapplethorpe.</p><p>Now that the endowment is on life support, the Republican leadership can cut to the chase and go after the religious right's real nemeses rather than the tiny agency scapegoated as their surrogate. Indeed, that's already happening, as Congress's newly passed abortion restrictions and the far-right tilt of the welfare-reform debate attest.</p><p>Given the enormous wealth and power of the real forces arrayed against it, you can only marvel that the N.E.A. is even standing. And you can only thank those arts advocates, however outgunned, who served as the first line of defense against an intolerant social revolution that will soon engulf us all.</p>                </div>
