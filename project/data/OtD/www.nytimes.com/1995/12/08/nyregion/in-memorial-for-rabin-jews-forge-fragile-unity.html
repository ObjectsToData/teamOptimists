The planners made little distinction between honoring Israel's assassinated prime minister and supporting the peace negotiations that were his culminating life's work.         But the challenge of filling 17,000 seats at Madison Square Garden on short notice quickly moved the rally's organizers to call on the dense network of Orthodox Jewish organizations and their loyal members. And in so doing, they were forced to modify their original plans, and conduct negotiations among Jewish groups that at times seemed as fragile and complex as those between Israel and the Palestinians.

The planners made little distinction between honoring Israel's assassinated prime minister and supporting the peace negotiations that were his culminating life's work.</p><p>But the challenge of filling 17,000 seats at Madison Square Garden on short notice quickly moved the rally's organizers to call on the dense network of Orthodox Jewish organizations and their loyal members. And in so doing, they were forced to modify their original plans, and conduct negotiations among Jewish groups that at times seemed as fragile and complex as those between Israel and the Palestinians.</p><p>In the end, Sunday's 10 A.M. memorial for Yitzhak Rabin and rally for peace  in the Middle East will be an ambiguous event as well as an ambitious one; it will try to embrace, with harmony, nearly opposing points of view on the specifics of making peace in the Middle East.</p><p>The sponsors, led by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, have carefully recast all references to "the peace process." It is now a rally dedicated to "the pursuit of peace," because some Orthodox leaders complained that "peace process" was actually a code reference to the Labor government's agreements with Yasir Arafat to turn over control of the West Bank's occupied territories to the Palestinians.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Prime Minister Shimon Peres accepted an invitation to speak at the rally with the acknowledgment, quoted by the organizers, that although Jews everywhere are  committed to peace and security for Israel, "we may differ over particular details."</p><p>The Israeli Chief Rabbi, Yisrael Meir Lau, will also have a prominent role, which will give Orthodox Jews a place on the program and inject a religious element. The sponsors quickly squelched rumors that Barbra Streisand might sing  at the event, which would have offended an Orthodox Jewish stricture against women singing in public.</p><p>However, organizers resisted demands that someone representing the Israeli opposition or critics of the peace negotiations address the rally. "There is only one Prime Minister," said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the  Conference of Presidents. "There is only one democratically elected Government of Israel." In the past, he said, Jewish organizations like his had invited Prime Minister Menachem Begin to speak without a counterpoint speech by an opposition leader.</p><p>Also speaking will be Leah Rabin, whose trenchant remarks blaming Israeli opposition leaders for creating the political climate that lead to her husband's death have also made some Jews apprehensive about the event Sunday.</p><p>But Mr. Peres is being accompanied to New York by the Deputy Knesset Speaker, Ovadia Eli, a member of the Likud opposition party, who will be introduced at the Garden and "who will be very visible," according to Martin Begun, president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.</p><p>In addition to the council and the Conference of Presidents, the event's sponsors include the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York, the State of Israel Bonds and the World Jewish Congress.</p><p>Although polls indicate that more than two-thirds of non-Orthodox Jews in the United States support the current Middle East settlement, about two-thirds of Orthodox Jews oppose it, often passionately. The Orthodox constitute fewer than  10 percent of the country's Jewish population -- certainly fewer than 20 percent in the New York area -- but they are needed to fill the Garden on Sunday.</p><p>Yet while the original plans were changed to accommodate the Orthodox, organizers believe that their presence is also needed to send a message of unity back to Israel.</p><p>Jousting over the tone and character of the memorial and rally comes at a time of emotional ambivalence for many within the Orthodox world. As amply displayed in writing and speeches, they feel mortified that a religiously observant and educated Jew could have killed Mr. Rabin for religious reasons. But they also feel that all Orthodox Jews are being indiscriminately blamed for the murder, and that revulsion over the assassination is being used to tar any opposition to the policies Mr. Rabin initiated.</p><p>Important Orthodox groups like the Orthodox Union are supporting the rally. "It is extremely important that people come, especially Orthodox Jews," Rabbi Menachem Genack, an official of the Orthodox Union, said. "We are grieving a death, and we want to make the statement that the murderer has absolutely perverted our values."</p><p>But such groups as the National Council of Young Israel and the Zionist Organization of America are refusing to participate.</p><p>Rabbi Pesach Lerner, executive vice president of the National Council of Young Israel, an umbrella group of 125 synagogues, said that his group had originally supported the event with misgivings but had eventually pulled out.</p><p>"There should have been representatives from the 'loyal opposition,' " he said, "someone representing what we feel deep down."</p><p>Meanwhile, other groups are trying to give the gathering their own spin. An advertisement that Tikkun magazine placed in The New York Times yesterday described the rally as a way of "publicly repudiating the occupation and settler Judaism."</p><p>Americans for Peace Now, one of 53 Jewish groups spanning the political and religious spectrums represented in the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish  Organizations, declared that the rally's "formula of support for the government, coupled with the fact that the main speakers all support the peace process, will give a clear endorsement to Prime Minister Peres and his policies."</p><p>Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities at New  York University, said that the rally may be valuable "as a tactical maneuver," but added that "it leaves untouched the fundamental problem that there are pragmatic, sane politics and the politics of those convinced that God is on their side."</p>                </div>
