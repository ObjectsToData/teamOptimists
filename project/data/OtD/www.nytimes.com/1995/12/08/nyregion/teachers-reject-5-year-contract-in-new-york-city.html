Giuliani, whose labor strategy was plunged into  uncertainty.</p><p>It was the first time in the 35-year history of the United Federation of Teachers that the rank and file membership rejected a tentative contract agreement negotiated for them. With all 55,059 teachers' ballots counted, the vote was 56 percent against to 44 percent in favor, according to figures from the American Arbitration Association, the nonprofit group that tallied the results.</p><p>Most teachers cited the contract's two-year wage freeze as the central factor in their decision to vote no. But the union president, Sandra Feldman, said she felt she could have sold the pact to them anyway -- until the Mayor announced his support for hefty pay increases for himself, his commissioners and other elected officials, only 10 days after reaching agreement with the union leadership.</p><p>The City Council approved those raises yesterday, just hours before results of the seven-day teachers' vote, conducted by secret ballot, were known.

                    <p>"I think it's very hard to justify asking teachers to wait two years for a raise and then going out and saying we're going to give it to other people, to elected officials and managers," Ms. Feldman said at a news conference last night. "That tipped it."</p><p>Mr. Giuliani, in turn, sharply criticized Ms. Feldman, saying her outspoken opposition to the pay raises had hampered her efforts to sell the agreement.</p><p>What will happen next was not immediately clear, as Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Feldman, allies throughout much of his two years in office, prescribed opposing  courses of action yesterday. While Ms. Feldman said she would ask today to return to the bargaining table, Mr. Giuliani said the city would instead seek to go directly to nonbinding arbitration. If the union refused, he said, there would simply be no contract.</p><p>He predicted that, once the process runs its course, the teachers would end up with less than was originally offered. "There's no way that they're going to  get a better contract," he said in a radio interview last night.</p><p>Speaking at a forum in Queens last night, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew expressed disappointment that the contract was rebuffed. He had endorsed the agreement, which he hoped would make it easier for principals to fix ailing schools, though several members of the Board of Education had expressed reservations.</p><p>"For the first time," he said, "there was a contract agreement between the Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers which was focused on the kinds of educational innovations necessary to improve the quality of education for the children of New York City."</p><p>The vote, a victory for a grass-roots opposition, was to some an unmistakable repudiation of Ms. Feldman.</p><p>"She's the head of the negotiating team," said Bruce Markens, a teacher at the High School for the Humanities in Manhattan and a dissident representing the borough's high schools on the union executive committee. "It's a defeat of the leadership style."</p><p>Bucking the teachers, who make up the dominant wing of the union membership,  several far smaller categories of support workers -- including a majority of paraprofessionals, nurses and social workers -- voted to approve the contract, meaning it would apply to them if ratified by the Board of Education later this  month, union officials said. But it was the action of the teachers that was more significant.</p><p>They had begun raising their voices in opposition immediately after the contract was announced by the Mayor, Ms. Feldman, and Dr. Crew at a City Hall news conference on Nov. 4.</p><p>While the Mayor heralded the pact as historic for its five-year length, some  teachers had derided the two-year wage freeze as draconian.</p><p>Many teachers appeared to regard the contract vote as a referendum on the Mayor's leadership, as well as on their own income. They said that continuing school budget cuts by the Giuliani administration, which have led to increased class sizes and reduced support, like guidance counseling, have made their jobs  harder.</p><p>"People lose track of the fact that Giuliani has already cut so much out of our budgets in the schools that we are reduced to a very different style of operating," said Leslie Pule, who teaches English as a second language at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. "It means we work harder because we have to deal with a whole lot more."</p><p>Others lamented that, while the top salary would have been increased to $70,000 from $60,000 under the contract, the time required to receive that salary was being extended from 20 to 25 years. Younger teachers said they were troubled that the contract allowed the board to withhold 5 percent of a starting teacher's salary for four years.</p><p>Linda Farrell, a 26-year veteran now teaching at Martin Luther King Jr. High  School, said, "I think it's a lousy contract, and I think Giuliani has to be given a strong message that we're not going to stand for it."</p><p>But Ms. Feldman had worked hard to persuade her members that the deal was the best she could get.  She emphasized that it raised wages and benefits 13 percent over the last three years, prohibited layoffs during the first three and guaranteed labor peace with the city through the turn of the century.</p><p>David Kaufman, a co-chairman of New Action, the major opposition group within the federation, said last night Ms. Feldman's videotapes told teachers they could hold their heads up high with this agreement.</p><p>"The membership can hold its head up high right now," Mr. Kaufman said after  learning of the vote.</p><p>Mr. Kaufman, who teaches science at Middle School 135 in the Bronx, was at a  retirement dinner for three teachers last night when he heard about the vote. As word spread, a cheer went up in the room.</p><p>"If the Mayor can justify his own raise -- and I think he deserves it -- then so do we," he added. "What we're saying to President Feldman is go back to the table, you can do better."</p><p>Mr. Kaufman also said that the vote was a sign that Ms. Feldman's reign may be at its end.</p><p>"This is the beginning of our membership saying goodbye to President Feldman," he said.</p><p>Some of the seven members of the Board of Education, including the board president, Carol A. Gresser, had expressed concerns about some provisions, including one that would have removed teachers from cafeteria and hall duty, without specifying their replacements.</p><p>Mayor Giuliani is pushing a plan to tap welfare recipients as those replacements, a plan criticized by parents, some teachers and principals.</p><p>Unions for 140,000 nonuniformed municipal workers have already begun to vote  on a contract similar to the teachers' pact. They, too, reached a five-year agreement that offers job security for three years, a pay freeze for the first two and a 13 percent increase in wages and benefits during the last three.</p><p>The Mayor had once hoped to use the teachers' agreement to set the general pattern for contracts with all of the city's 83 municipal unions.</p><p>Photo: Workers at the American Arbitration Association on West 51stStreet yesterday counting ballots cast by the United Federation of Teachers.
