The last two concerts will be held in Peekskill and again in Cold Spring. Classical chamber music will give way to jazz and early American works in performances on Oct. 20, and the vocal ensemble Pomerium is featured in the final presentation on Oct. 22.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Tickets are $10, $5 for children and people 65 and older, free for children younger than 7. For a printed schedule, reservations or other information, call 265-4273. CEMETERY TOUR</p><p>New York, like many states, requires each municipality to have an official town historian, and in Pound Ridge he is Richard Major 3d, who will lead a tour of cemeteries next Saturday. Seven or eight graveyards will be visited by bus, departing from the Pound Ridge Elementary School on Route 172 at 1:30 P.M., rain or shine. The fee is $15, and reservations must be made by calling 764-4538.</p><p>Some of the old cemeteries are small, with perhaps five graves. Family members were interred on their own land rather than on church grounds as they are today, and in order to preserve abandoned graveyards the town took possession of them. "Headstones were being stolen and sold for all sorts of purposes like cocktail tables," Mr. Major said.</p><p>A guide to 18 cemeteries in Pound Ridge was compiled in 1942.</p><p>Among the oldest headstones is that of Jonathan Brown of Stamford, dated Feb. 23, 1768, in a cemetery on Barnegat Road. The Knapp-Barhite Cemetery on Kitchawan Road was in continued use through the early part of this century, while the age of a defunct burying ground across the road is difficult to determine because so many of the inscriptions have worn away. The latest one is dated 1847.</p><p>One of the oldest ones, on Upper Shad Road, "is in terrible shape," Mr. Major said, with headstones crumbled or toppled, but Selleck's Corner at the New Canaan line has been adopted by the cemetery association of a church. The expense of repairing centuries-old grave markers, Mr. Major fears, has been a nearly fatal deterrent to preserving the artifacts.</p><p>The tour will end with a visit to the Mercy Waring House, built in 1740 and still in use as a private residence. It is the oldest house in town. HUNT COUNTRY ON VIEW</p><p>Six private farms and a vineyard in some of New York State's finest horse and cattle country will be open to the public from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. today for the Fourth Annual Dutchess Hunt Country Self-Guided Tour. Tickets at $25, $10 for children younger than 12, free for those younger than 2 may be obtained at the Dutchess County Farm Home Center or Allyn's Restaurant, both on Route 44 in Millbrook. Call 677-3002 for recorded information or the restaurant, 677-5888.</p><p>The beneficiary of tickets sales is the Dutchess Land Conservancy, which has acquired 7,000 acres of farmland, woods and wetlands in its 10 years of existence.</p><p>Each property will offer something different. At Rally Farms, 150 purebred Angus cattle roam over 2,900 acres, while Highland Farms is home to the Millbrook Morgans, the first all-American horse and the mount chosen by the Cavalry. A restored hunt stable and elegant indoor ring will be open at Thorndale, a premiere thoroughbred farm where dressage exhibitions will be presented.</p><p>Carriage-driving demonstrations and tours of barns containing a collections of carriages will be the special offering at Rivenoak Farm's equestrian center, and Jack Russell terrier races will be held at the Yellowframe Horse Farm. Horseshoeing, a croquet tournament at Trotwood Farm, a 3 P.M. polo match at the Mashomack Club and wine tasting at the Millbrook Vineyards are other attractions. YONKERS WINDOW ART</p><p>The arts have proved an enlivener of many downtown districts, and Yonkers has added itself to the list that includes Peekskill, Ossining and New Rochelle. Aided by the Westchester Arts Council and the Federal Community Block Grant program, Yonkers will initiate its effort with a Windows on Main Street exhibition, opening next Saturday and running through Nov. 3.</p><p>More than 30 merchants, institutions and services with frontage on Main Street and the blocks from Getty Square to Buena Vista Avenue have given over their windows, lobbies and interiors to art. About 45 artists, organized as the nonprofit group Art on Main Street Yonkers, have contributed paintings, sculpture, collages, installations, illustrations, photographs, mixed-media work and pastels to the display.</p><p>From 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. next Saturday as part of the opening-day events, the plaza in Getty Square will be the site of ensemble concerts and dance performances, and walking tours will originate there. DIARY READING</p><p>Children and adults will take part in a community reading of the diary of Anne Frank in Ulster County next Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Accord Train Station on Main Street. The reading marks the 50th anniversary of her death at the age of 15 in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Admission will be $6. Call 626-9710 for more information. JEWISH-LIFE LECTURES</p><p>Five professors from the humanities division of Purchase College will deliver individual lectures at Temple Israel in New Rochelle weekly at 8 P.M., beginning Wednesday and running through Nov. 8. Under the title "Reflections on Jewish Life and Culture," the programs will cover subjects of interest to a wider range of people than those with religious or cultural connections to Judaism.</p><p>Lee Schlesinger, professor of literature, will open the series with "Vixens and Visionaries: Women in the Bible," followed on Oct. 18 by Frank Farrell, associate professor of philosophy, whose topic will be "From Athens to Jerusalem: The Question of Ethics."</p><p>Jane Kromm, associate professor of art and a specialist on feminist issues, will speak on "The Misrepresentation of Jewish Women in Art," and "The Jewish Family in Holocaust Literature" will be discussed by Sheldon Grebstein, professor of literature and former president of the college. The final lecture, "Jerusalem: The Metaphor and the Mundane," will be given by Roberta Barkan, associate professor of Hebrew and director of the Jewish Studies Program. Temple Israel is at 1000 Pinebrook Boulevard; admission to the series is free. PETER CAREY TO SPEAK</p><p>Peter Carey, the speaker at the Hudson Valley Writer's series today at 4 P.M., has won many literary awards in his native Australia, from 1974, when "The Fat Man in History," a collection of stories, was published, through 1988, when "Oscar and Lucinda" won Australia's National Book Council Award and the Booker Prize for fiction in Great Britain.</p><p>His newest novel, "The Unusual Life of Tristam Smith," was published in the United States this year by Alfred A. Knopf.</p><p>Mr. Carey is teaching creative writing at New York University and Princeton. His talk will be given in the Music Room at Caramoor in Katonah. Admission is $10, and the phone number for reservations or more information is 232-1252. ELEANOR CHARLES</p><p>Photo: Jack Russell terrier races at the Dutchess Hunt Country Tour.
