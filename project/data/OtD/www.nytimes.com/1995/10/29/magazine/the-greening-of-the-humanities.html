They were not the first to go. "A few years ago, we had only a handful of students, maybe four or five majors per year," said John Elder, a professor of both English and environmental studies at Middlebury who has become a guru in the latter program.

There are similar stories from professors at Dartmouth, Harvard, Oberlin, Swarthmore,  the University of Nevada at Reno and elsewhere.</p><p>This interest reflects genuine concern over the environment; as a field it makes special sense, considering what has happened in the academy over the past  few decades. The activism of the 1960's gave way, in the mid-70's, to various interest groups gathered under the rubric of "theory" -- literary and cultural theory, that is. These advocates of what is loosely called poststructuralism were mostly apolitical, despite their rhetorical fervor; activism, by the 80's,  was generally "out" on most campuses.</p><p>Environmental studies marks a return to activism and social responsibility; it also signals a dismissal of theory's more solipsistic tendencies. From a literary aspect, it marks a re-engagement with realism, with the actual universe of rocks, trees and rivers that lies behind the wilderness of signs.</p>                </div>

                    <p>ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES BEGAN in the sciences -- geology, biology, meteorology -- but it has widened its embrace to include humanities and social sciences. To find out how environmental studies connected to literature, my field, I attended a gathering in the Colorado Rockies this summer: the first conference of the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment. On the plane from Denver to Fort Collins, I sat beside a rumpled looking man in his 50's with a black mustache and peculiar beard; he looked like an English professor, and he was. Prof. Barton St. Armand, who teaches at Brown, was also attending the conference. I asked him if environmental studies was the latest fad in academe.</p><p>"Absolutely not," he said. "This is a new place in the curriculum. Students like it because it taps into some very basic concerns, and teachers of literature like it because they're bored with theory. Literary theory wasn't real. Nature is tangible." He paused to reflect. "We're seeing a return to realism, to exact and esthetically pleasing descriptions of nature."</p><p>The first morning of the conference, I met my colleague John Elder for breakfast at a pancake house in Fort Collins. Scott Russell Sanders, an essayist, sat across from us in the booth, beside Prof. Lawrence Buell, who teaches at Harvard. Professor Buell's latest book, "The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture," has become the standard work on the subject, and a pioneering example of what is being called "ecocriticism."</p><p>Since arriving in Fort Collins, I'd been hearing about ecocritics. I asked Professor Buell if he was one. "Let's just say there is such a thing as ecocriticism," he said. "We've gotten used to character, theme and plot; it's the sense of place that is ignored or slighted. The ecocritics are trying to remedy that."</p><p>Eating pancakes with these men was intimidating. All three are magnificent specimens of the human animal: sinewy, tall, sun-tanned. Obviously, much can be  said for getting out of the classroom. They all climb mountains and run on country roads. I can't imagine any of them smoking.</p><p>We strolled together through the leafy, modern Colorado State campus to the Lory Student Center, now jammed with youngish professors. I sipped hot cider with a Mormon mountain climber whose shaved head reminded me of Mr. Clean; he stood between an aging hippie from Santa Cruz, Calif., in colorful, billowing trousers, and a robust Irishman who had recently spent more than a year by himself in a cabin in Maine -- a la Thoreau. "You're the first people I've talked to in a long time," he said.</p><p>Between sessions, I met Cheryll Glotfelty, a conference organizer. A wiry, intense woman with eyes like diamond chips, she compared the beginnings of ecocriticism to the feminist movement. "They began by rediscovering early or neglected texts by women," she said. "Then they re-examined the classics, reading Henry James, for example, from a feminist perspective. Then came the phase of theory: seeing how language itself constitutes reality. In much the same way, ecocritics are rediscovering early writers, rereading the classics from a 'green' perspective and beginning to frame their subject in a theoretical way."</p><p>Perhaps there is something new under the sun, and it is the sun itself. As David Orr, a professor of environmental studies at Oberlin, has noted: "Our subject, to borrow a phrase from Alfred North Whitehead, is 'life in all its manifestations.' We study cities as well as forests, and one of our main interests is design: how to live in ways that are ecologically sound as well as  esthetically pleasing. In this sense, it's tremendously practical as a subject.  Environmentalism is, ultimately, a question of design -- of ethical design."</p>                </div>
