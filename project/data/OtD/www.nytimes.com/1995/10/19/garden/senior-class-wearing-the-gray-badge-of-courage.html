                    <p>EVENTUALLY, old age announces itself. Eyes fail, limbs ache, skin wrinkles. But before that happens in a serious way, most of us do some announcing of our own. We line up for senior discounts at subway booths or movie theaters. We dye  our hair -- or stop dyeing it. We brag about our grandchildren, admit retirement, even tell people our real age.</p><p>Little scientific research has been done on these small moments of truth, these public admissions of our years. But two dozen interviews with experts and  a cross section of older people suggest that these decisions are not made lightly and without some soul-searching.</p><p>Though the image of older people has improved somewhat in recent years, being old still carries heavy social and economic freight. Small wonder that we  avoid the label as long as possible. "Coming to grips with age and death is tough," said Harry Moody, the acting director of the Brookdale Center on Aging in New York. "Sometimes denial is a good thing."</p><p>And deny we do. Consider David Garth, the 65-year-old New York political consultant, in front of his bathroom mirror. "I have a special angle where I can see myself the way I used to be," he said. "Then you see yourself on television, and you say, 'Who is that old guy?' "</p>                </div>

                    <p>The first time Mr. Garth was offered a discount at the movies, he said, "I was outraged." He still pays full price. "It's as though I'm just not aware of the discounts," he said. "I'm blocking."</p><p>Lillian Troll, 80, is a retired psychology professor in Alameda, Calif. "When I first became eligible for a movie discount, I didn't do it," she said. "I felt embarrassed about saying I was that old. It took me about five years. Then I just got used to the idea that people realized I was older."</p><p>Depending on your state of mind and the state of your pocketbook, the incentives to declare your age can be powerful, but some admissions are more public than others. Discounted airline tickets, for example, are pretty anonymous. On the other hand, heeding the airline boarding announcement that gives seniors advance seating puts you right out there. Slipping 60 cents into the bus fare box in New York usually attracts no attention, but the Washington Metro Farecard for older people is bright orange, while the regular card is white.</p><p>John Hendricks, a professor of sociology at Oregon State University in Corvallis, views such discounts and privileges as a kind of benign ageism -- he  calls it the "poor dear syndrome" because it lumps all older people within a stereotype of being frail and destitute and in need of help. "It means that younger people will see you as different from them," he said, "lesser than them, not someone they would be interested in talking to. You get a 10 percent discount, but you are also being depreciated 10 percent."</p><p>Mr. Garth puts it this way: "The worst fear people have about getting older is being dependent and out of control. One of the symbols of being dependent is  taking advantage of these things. Those who do it feel they're owed something, and I understand that. But I do away with all the symbols of dependency I can."</p><p>Of course, there are some people who simply relish discounts. "I'm not a rich person," said Genevieve Burke, a 72-year-old receptionist at the University of Vermont in Burlington. "I enjoy getting a bargain anytime, whether it's at the movies or at a flea market."</p><p>Many are the ways older people hide, and reveal, their age. Driving a car is  a positive sign that you are part of the mainstream, said Susan A. Eisenhandler, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut in Waterbury. And giving up driving is a major acknowledgment of old age. "Even those who do will often keep renewing their license as proof positive that they're not really old," she said.</p><p>Some older people cringe when the post office delivers a copy of Modern Maturity, the American Association of Retired Persons magazine. Others determinedly stay away from senior centers and other senior activities.</p><p>"Friends tell me about the great trip they had, with all the details," said Elise Maclay, a Westport, Conn., writer. "But when I ask who sponsored it, there's this hesitation to admit it was Elderhostel, followed by assurances of how lively the other people on the trip were. If it had been an Audubon Society  or Yale alumni trip, they would have said so in a minute."</p><p>Asked to give her own age, Ms. Maclay refused, for what she said was a very practical reason. "The world thinks, and editors think, you're not au courant, you're not 'with it' anymore," she said.</p><p>At a certain point, though, many older people take a different tack on that issue. "I don't mind saying how old I am," said Kenneth Lawson, 69, a retired lab technician in North Providence, R.I. "Maybe it has something to do with people thinking I look and act much younger."</p><p>Hugh Downs, a host of "20/20" on ABC-TV, makes no bones about acknowledging that he is 74: "Suppose I said I was 55. Then people would say, 'He's not in such good shape.' Now they say, 'You can't be that old.' " In any event, Mr. Downs said, he works in an industry where one's age cannot be hidden. "Lucky for me," he added, "it's an industry where it's not politically correct to discriminate against older people."</p><p>The issue of when to 'fess up gets little attention among gerontologists, said Lynne Gershensohn Hodgson, the chairwoman of the sociology and gerontology  department at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn. "Do gerontologists who have spent their whole lives trying to eradicate negative attitudes toward older people put color in their hair?" she said. "We don't talk about it."</p><p>Professor Hodgson, who is 45, told of having dinner at a gerontological conference with a group of colleagues, most of whom were considerably older. "The print on the menu was tiny, and we all were having trouble with it," she recalled. "So for the first time in public I pulled out my reading glasses. I was going to show them how I acknowledged my aging. The next thing I knew, they  all pulled out their reading glasses."</p><p>But times may be changing. Dr. Gene D. Cohen, the director of the Center on Aging, Health and the Humanities at George Washington University, believes that  age stereotypes are weakening. "In the past, when you were 65, you were statistically much closer to death than today," he said. "A longer, healthier life span makes older people more comfortable with their age, and that makes them less likely to deny their aging."</p><p>The fact that older people are healthier, more active and better educated is  also changing attitudes among the younger generations, Dr. Cohen said, because it fudges the differences between young and old that feed stereotypes. In other  words, nowadays when you announce your age and a younger person says you don't look it, the chances are it's true. You're part of a historical process that is  turning old age into more of a point of pride and less of an embarrassment.</p><p>Drawing.
