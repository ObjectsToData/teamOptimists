The New York Public Library owns Howard Moss's plastic pencil sharpener and fragments of Percy Shelley's skull.

"We figured out why she never got off the sofa," said Lisa Brower, acting curator of the library's Berg Collection.</p><p>Librarians often kid about exhibiting the tchotchkes in their collections, but last spring the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University actually did it. In a show called "Things," which closed earlier this month, were such unlikely artifacts as Sitting Bull's moccasins, a piece of the bullet that killed Lord Nelson and the chamber pot used by Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he was at Yale to receive an honorary degree.</p><p>Also among the show's more than 250 objects were a feather from James Weldon Johnson's pet parrot, a pressed rose from the garden of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Carl Van Vechten's ceramic cats and a mold of Benny Goodman's teeth, of scholarly interest because his tooth was chipped where he clasped the reed of his clarinet. The exhibition looked very much like a tag sale, which prompted George Miles, curator of Western Americana, to suggest facetiously that the library hold one to avoid having to continue to store the objects.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But for Joseph W. Reed, a professor of English and American studies at Wesleyan University (and chairman of the Beinecke's trustees), who curated the show, "Things" was not a joke. "If there was any intimation that this was an attempt to make fun of the collection, I said I wouldn't go on with it," he explained.</p><p>"Things" was actually the realization of an idea Mr. Reed had in 1956, when, as an undergraduate working in the university's rare book collection, he mounted a small but similar exhibition for the library staff's Christmas party. Four years ago, when he began gathering material for "Things," he found that some of the best relics from the first show had disappeared, including a stuffed raven that had belonged to Charles Dickens and William Howard Taft's boxer shorts. The shorts, Mr. Reed recalled, "were a good two and a half feet wide" and had been taken from Mr. Taft as part of an extinct hazing ritual called Freshman Rush.</p><p>Mr. Reed arranged the trove in a playful manner, juxtaposing in one vitrine two castings of Thomas Carlyle's hands, some death masks and the model of Mr. Goodman's teeth. But not everyone was amused. At the trustees' opening, when Perdita Schaffner, daughter of the poet Hilda Doolittle (a k a H. D.), peered at one of the masks, the color drained from her face. "That's my mother," she mumbled.</p><p>The Beinecke is not the only library to have exhibited its weird artifacts. Last December, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas mounted the show "Worldly Possessions," which included Gloria Swanson's sunglasses from "Sunset Boulevard," the moccasins worn by D. H. Lawrence in Taos, N. M., and the chain-smoking novelist Carson McCullers's cigarette lighter.</p><p>(The center also owns Evelyn Waugh's writing table, which the director, Thomas F. Staley, called "the most uncomfortable desk I ever sat in.")</p><p>Using Mr. Reed's categories -- hair, vegetable matter, apparel, "splinters and chips off the old block," etc. -- one can get a sense of where a few of the great tchotchkes are housed. HAIR</p><p>Given the Victorian penchant for preserving locks, 19th-century human hair abounds. Animal hair, however, is scarce, and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York has a particularly exotic strand from the tail of Traveller, Robert E. Lee's horse. The hank of Thomas Payne's hair at Columbia University is significant because it's all that remains of him; his body was dug up for shipment to England but got lost in transit. In 1979, the Lilly Library at Indiana University devoted an entire exhibition to hair, showcasing clumps from William Wordsworth, Edgar Allan Poe, Simon Bolivar and George Washington. Sylvia Plath's childhood hair -- clipped at four different ages -- inspired the show; the library purchased it in 1978, as part of a large archive belonging to the poet's mother. VEGETABLE MATTER</p><p>Amy Lowell's cigar and pressed edelweiss from the collection of Ralph Waldo Emerson highlight the holdings of the Houghton Library at Harvard University; they are not just distinguished by association but as organic objects in their own right. The Lilly Library owns a button of peyote (an intrinsically significant object) with instructions for ingesting it, but it is, alas, among the papers of the midcentury poetry anthologist Oscar Williams, whose name is not exactly a household word.
