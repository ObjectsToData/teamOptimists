But few were prepared for Thursday's move by Republicans in the House of Representatives to shut down the national arts and humanities endowments altogether within the next two years.</p><p>While the outcome of the House's actions remains unclear -- the proposals must first pass the entire House and then the Senate -- the mere fact that the abolition of the endowments had come to a vote jolted many arts groups into grappling with the unthinkable: life without Federal money.</p><p>At a three-day Arts and Business Council conference coincidentally being held in Manhattan late this week, dozens of arts representatives, grant givers and business leaders were already convening panels on how to deal with an anticipated financing shortfall. Still the news from Washington drastically changed the atmosphere.</p><p>"We're already talking about the post-N.E.A. era and the vote has not even been held yet," lamented Lindy Zesch, deputy director of the Theater Communications Group and a former endowment aide. "I think everyone agrees that the private sector cannot possibly close the gap created by the Contract With America."</p>                </div>

                    <p>In other parts of the country, reaction was also somber. Roche Schufler, the executive director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago and chairman of American Arts Alliance, blamed "people in Congress who are determined to misrepresent the picture of what the agency has accomplished over the past 30 years."</p><p>But he added: "This didn't start yesterday and it isn't going to end tomorrow. We are going to keep working and we are going to prevail in the end. We aren't going away. The arts are not going to cease to exist. And people in the arts are not going to stop speaking out."</p><p>Others also said they saw events as part of a sequence of developments that have been reconfiguring the culture world, much as economic retrenchments after Wall Street's high-flying years created sober new realities in the corporate world.</p><p>"We went through shock, denial and advocacy," said Robert N. Sellar, the northeast community relations manager for the International Business Machines Corporation. Anticipating cutbacks in arts financing, Mr. Sellar convened arts groups for a series of round-table discussions five years ago that helped lead to the business-arts seminar this week. The final stage, he said, was "recognition of reality."</p><p>The talks, he said, were therapeutic, reminding hard-pressed arts groups: "You are not alone."</p><p>Others were just plain angry. Robert T. Buck, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, pronounced himself surprised by "the the scorpionlike swiftness" of the two-year deadline. "I think this sounds like the result of total madness," he said.</p><p>"It sounds like Congress in total zoolike disarray," he said. "Jurassic Congress."</p><p>Jane Alexander, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, who was in New York yesterday to preside over an awards ceremony at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, declined to comment on the Congressional action.</p><p>The arts and humanities endowments, which distribute grants totaling about $300 million a year, were to have at least three to five years more to run under House and Senate measures. The debate in the so-called culture wars is to resume next week.</p><p>At the Arts and Business Council conference, which was held at the Smith Barney building in lower Manhattan and ended yesterday, updates on the events in Congress were distributed by Nancy Meier, the executive director of the council, which brings together people in the arts and business and has affiliates in 30 cities.</p><p>Many of the arts representatives went to the conference seeking to make contacts with businessmen seeking affiliations with cultural groups. Ms. Meier cautioned some of the hopefuls against expecting quick results.</p><p>"Building a sponsorship takes time," she said. "You've got to build a relationship."</p><p>She said there was a danger, particularly in the current climate, that arts groups might be tempted to tailor their programs to attract corporate sponsors.</p><p>Mr. Sellar, of I.B.M., said corporations were driven by self-interest in sponsoring arts groups. The relationship, he said, has to enhance the corporate image, and companies shy away from controversy: a sobering thought for anti-establishment artists.</p><p>Private giving to the arts (fostered by tax deductibility) vastly overshadows the public contributions, a fact that cuts both ways in the debate. Opponents of Government financing argue that the arts are already largely relying on private support, so the Federal endowments are dispensable. Proponents of the status quo counter that private givers are doing a big part, so the Government can do a small part.</p><p>According to figures compiled by the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel, however, private giving to the arts -- which accounts for about a third of all income to nonprofit arts groups -- is not making up for government cutbacks.</p><p>The figures, distributed at the conference, showed arts giving totaling $9.6 billion last year, a drop of nearly 2 percent from the year before when inflation was factored in. Overall, private giving to all causes stayed marginally ahead of inflation at nearly $130 billion last year.</p><p>But while private support is a much larger factor than Federal and state grants in the arts in general and helps sustain leading arts institutions, many small arts groups in particular rely on public grants for survival, which explains in part why the proposed Federal cuts are so bemoaned.</p><p>Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, called the House action "not only short-sighted, but it ignores the fact that the arts, unlike almost everything else that's funded by the government, are an economic engine."</p><p>"The sad fact is that after all these years we still have to justify support for the arts," Mr. Leventhal said.  "It's discouraging to have to make the same arguments over and over."</p><p>Martha Wilson, the director of the Franklin Furnace Archive, an avant-garde performance space in Manhattan, said events were moving faster than anyone had predicted.</p><p>"The small institutions have seen the writing on the wall for years." she said. "Since 1990 we've been aware that the avant-garde is not popular. The big ones are now seeing that the waves of conservativism are lapping at their steps, too. The climate that was once warm is now cold, and we will have to find other ways to survive."</p><p>Jonathan Katz, the chief executive officer of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, whose members get block grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, said the value of the Federal dollars was that they provide stability and predictability for arts organizations and artists.</p><p>"This is not an issue of government agencies," Mr. Katz said. "It's an issue that affects people who live in cities and suburbs and rural areas. It's about the frequency and quality of the art available to them to participate in."</p><p>"The war isn't lost," he added. "The thing that arts organizations do have is the power to get elected officials to an arts event and turn them into arts advocates."</p><p>Photo: Nancy Meier, executive director of the Arts and Business Council, at an arts panel discussion yesterday.
