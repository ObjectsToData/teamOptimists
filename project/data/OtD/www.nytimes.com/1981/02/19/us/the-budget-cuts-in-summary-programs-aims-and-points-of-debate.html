    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  MEDICAID A joint Federal-state program that pays doctor, hospital, nursing home and other health costs of the poor. The Federal share ranges from 50 to 70 percent, with the highest proportion going to states with the lowest per-capita income. Within broad Federal guidelines, states set rules for eligibility, covered services and payment rates. Eligible persons are entitled to have their bills paid, whatever the total cost. Spending has risen more than 15 percent a year over the last five years, primarily because of higher health costs, and the program would cost the Government more than $18 billion in the fiscal year 1982 if no changes were made. President Reagan would reduce the anticipated Federal grants to the states by $100 million in the current fiscal year and by $1 billion in 1982. After that, the Federal contribution to the program would rise at the same rate as the inflation rate in the economy. States would have to make up the difference, either by changing eligibility requirements, reducing payment rates or making their programs more efficient. States such as New York with the most generous rules would lose the most Federal dollars. Spending would be reduced by $1 billion below current estimates in 1982 and the savings would increase each year until they reached $5 billion in 1985.">

                    States would be forced to make their programs more efficient and limit the program to the truly needy. The proposal would place an additional financial burden on the states. Some could be expected to withdraw needed services from the poor. Reduced payment rates could lead more doctors, hospitals and nursing homes to refuse Medicaid patients. Probable opponents are some states, medical and hospital lobbies, and civil rights and labor groups. SOCIAL SECURITY STUDENT AND MINIMUM BENEFITS A minimum monthly Social Security benefit is paid retired workers whose earnings would otherwise entitle them to less. The minimum is $122 a month. The cost is about $3 billion a year. Students between the ages of 18 and 21 whose parents are dead, retired or disabled are also entitled to Social Security benefits. In 1982, it is estimated that 850,000 students will collect $2.8 billion. President Carter proposed that the two programs be abolished, but Congress never seriously considered his proposal. The President would abolish the minimum benefit. No new student recipients would be enrolled, and students already in school would have their benefits reduced by 25 percent. The proposal would save about $1 billion a year in the minimum benefits and $700 million in student benefits in 1982, rising to $1.7 billion in 1985. Those figures take into account the prospect that spending for some other programs would rise. The two programs benefit many who are not truly needy. Poor persons who receive payments under the programs would be eligible for other forms of Federal assistance. Eliminating the programs takes benefits away from workers who paid into the Social Security system with the unerstanding that they would be eligible for the money if their situation warranted it. It could be the first step toward dismantling the Social Security System.  Probable opponents are organizations of the elderly, and colleges and universities. SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY Part of each worker's Social Security taxes (1.3 percent of wages, divided equally between employer and employee) is set aside for disability insurance. Individuals and their families are eligible for benefits if a person has worked 20 of the previous 40 calendar quarters and is determined to have a totally disabling condition that leaves him or her unable to engage in ''substantial gainful activity.'' It is one of the fastest growing and costliest Federal programs. In 1982, estimated payments totaling $19 billion will go to about three million people. The President wants to tighten administration to reduce payments to ineligible beneficiaries, limit benefits so they do not exceed a worker's previous after-tax income and require that individuals must have worked six of the 13 previous calendar quarters to be entitled to benefits. Taking into account related increases in other Federal assistance programs, the proposals would save $600 million in the fiscal year 1982 and $1.9 billion in 1984. The error rate in disability payments is as high as 15 to 20 percent. It is inequitable for disabled workers who also receive such benefits as workmen's compensation and veterans' compensation to end up with more than they had earned when working. Vulnerable people would be denied benefits. Workers who have paid Social Security taxes over the years would be denied their rightful benefits. Probable opponents are veterans organizations and lobbyists for social welfare. FOOD STAMPS Poor people are entitled to stamps that can be used as scrip to purchase food in grocery stores. The value of the stamps a household receives depends on the size of the household and the assets and income of its members. Allotments are changed annually based on changes in food costs. Twemty million people receive nearly $13 billion worth of food stamps a year. Major expansion came after teams of doctors found widespread malnutrition in 1969. Limit eligibility to families whose annual income is less than 130 percent of the official poverty level. For a family of four that would include those with an income below $11,000 a year. Make other technical changes in computing eligibility that would remove hundreds of thousands of households from the rolls. Reduce allotments for families with schoolchildren to take account of free school meals. Improve monitoring to prevent payment errors. The proposals would save $1.8 billion in 1982 and more in subsequent years. A substantial amount of money can be saved without serious harm to the truly needy. Some college students and others who are not really poor have abused the program. The program has been highly successful in eliminating malnutrition among the poor, and the administrative costs have been low compared with other welfare programs. Probable opponents are many conservative as well as liberal Congressmen who believe it is the best of the Federal welfare programs. CETA JOBS In the 1974-75 recession, Congress provided money under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act to local governments and nonprofit organizations so they could place unemployed workers on their payrolls. When the unemployment rate did not significantly abate, what was intended as a temporary measure was continued. The program now costs about $4 billion a year. Steps have recently been taken to assure that all workers in the program are disadvantaged.  About half are members of minority groups. The President proposes hiring no new workers under the program and eliminating all the positions in the next fiscal year. Ending the program would save about $4 billion a year. The program is primarily an expensive subsidy supporting state and local services. The program provides job experience for poor people who cannot find employment elsewhere and who would otherwise be on welfare. Probable opponents are organized labor, state and local governments and minority groups. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE Regular unemployment insurance benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks to workers who have been employed the requisite number of months, which varies from state to state. Extended benefits are paid for up to 13 additional weeks when the unemployment rate reaches a national or state ''trigger'' level. The national trigger is 4.5 percent unemployment among workers covered by the program. The state trigger is 4 percent. A state can also pay extended benefits when its overall unemployment rate reaches 5 percent. Without changes, the program would cost an estimated $23 billion in the fiscal year 1982. President Reagan would eliminate the national trigger, change the way the state triggers are calculated, raise the rate for triggering state plans, and strengthen the enforcement of a requirement that recipients be available for work at all times. Spending would be reduced by $1.2 billion in 1982 and by smaller amounts in subsequent years. Under the present formulas, benefits are extended in states after unemployment ebbs, and benefits may continue to be claimed when work is available. Changing the program could take benefits away from those who need help the most -the long-term unemployed during economic downturns.  Without extended benefits, unemployed workers will have to turn to other forms of Government assistance. Probable opponents are organized labor, minority groups and some local governments. TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE The trade adjustment program was created to get organized labor's support for free trade policies. It pays benefits supplementing unemployment insurance to workers when increases in imports ''contribute importantly'' to their loss of jobs. Benefits are 70 percent of prior gross earnings up to the average weekly manufacturing wage, which is now $269, and last 52 weeks. With import competition increasing, payment of benefits has steadily risen to $2.7 billion in the current fiscal year. Adjustment-assistance benefits would be no higher than unemployment insurance payments and would be given only when unemployment benefits ran out. The Administration would also tighten the definition of ''contribute importantly'' in assessing the impact of imports. Spending would be reduced by $1 billion or more in the next fiscal year, depending on how long adjustment-assistance benefits would extend. The hardship felt by workers eligible for adjustment assistance is no worse than that for other workers. Therefore, they are not entitled to higher benefits except, perhaps, to extend the payments somewhat longer so workers may find new jobs or relocate. Adjustment assistance was extended to workers instead of protection through tariffs and other trade barriers. Imports are a national problem, while unemployment insurance levels are set by states and vary widely across the country. Probable opponents are organized labor, particularly the textile, steel and automobile workers' unions, which have been heavily affected by imports. EDUCATION Expenditures for education in the fiscal year 1982 are estimated at more than $15 billion. There is hardly a public school or college in the country that is not dependent on Federal assistance. More than six million schoolchildren are enrolled in federally financed remedial programs for the disadvantaged. Six million college students and parents hold federally supported tuition loans for college, and another two million have scholarship grants. In elementary and secondary education, 57 programs would be consolidated into two block grants, one for local school districts and the other for states. Funds for the consolidated programs would be reduced by 20 percent, to $5.8 billion in 1982. States and communities would be given more discretion in how they spend Federal money. The impact aid program, which provides money to schools with children of Federal employees, would be cut by almost half, and a 20 percent cut would be made in grants for vocational education.  Regulations requiring spending for handicapped children, bilingual education and desegregation programs would be relaxed. In the area of higher education, limits would be placed on Federal grants and loans so that they would no longer be available to many middle- and upperincome students. The savings in aid to elementary and secondary schools would be $1.25 billion in 1982 and considerably more in subsequent years. The savings in higher education would be about $1 billion in 1982, when student aid would total slightly more than $4 billion, and much more afterward. The impact aid changes would save $450 million in 1982, and the vocational education changes would save $220 million. Primary and secondary education are basically local functions, and local governments know better how money should be spent. As expensive as college is, the Federal Government cannot afford to finance the tuition of any but the poor. Impact aid funds are not justified unless a large proportion of students in a school district live on Federal property. Local school authorities would tend to spend their allotments on politically popular programs rather than special aid for the poor and the handicapped. Even relatively well-to-do parents cannot afford rapidly rising tuition costs. The influential teachers' lobby will doubtless oppose most changes. Local school officials will oppose the reduction in assistance. Middle-income parents will oppose the changes in college grant and loan programs. FARMERS HOME ADMINISTRATION The Farmers Home Administration provides grants and loans to farmers to assist them in weather emergencies and to supply low-interest credit to those who qualify as having no other source of borrowing.  The agency also lends money and provides grants to rural communities to create water supply and sewer systems and build housing for the rural poor. The agency duplicates, for rural communities and farmers, most of the Federal lending and grant programs available in urban areas. In the current fiscal year the agency's programs will provide about $14.5 billion, most of that in low-interest or Governmentguaranteed loans. The President proposes a 25 percent, or $2.4 billion, cut in new, direct lending. This would be achieved by limiting disaster loans or reducing the activities of the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund, which provides loans, at 5 to 7 percent interest; by limiting home purchase and rental property loans available to low-income families, and by limiting new lending and grants for water supply and sewage treatment projects to $600 million as against $1.01 billion this year. About $100 million in spending in the first year but much larger savings in long-term obligations. Some low-interest loans have gone to farmers with considerable assets who have exhausted their commercial credit by overborrowing. Many disaster loans can be covered by a new Federal crop insurance program. And many of the community development and rural housing loans could be obtained from other Federal agencies. Most other Federal agencies are situated in distant cities.  Farmrelated offices are in most county seats, accessible to farmers and residents of small towns. Also, for young farmers trying to get started, low-interest loans from the agency are about the only credit available. Probable opponents are Congressmen from rural areas and farm organizations. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION The National Science Foundation was set up after World War II to build American prowess in the ''basic'' or ''pure'' sciences. It has recently added programs in applied science, behavioral sciences, scientific and engineering education, and to help women and minority members enter scientific occupations. Its budget, most of which is allotted to university researchers, will grow to slightly more than $1 billion in the fiscal year 1982 if changes are not made. More than three-quarters goes for work in physics, chemistry, biology and other ''hard'' sciences. The President would leave intact the programs in the hard sciences, but drastically cut President Carter's proposals for support of the behavioral sciences, expanded science education and minority programs. A proposal to spend $75 million to replace outdated laboratory equipment in colleges would be eliminated. Particularly hard hit would be support of sociology and economics, cut to $10 million from a proposed $40 million. The President estimates that foundation spending would be reduced by $15 million below what would have otherwise been spent without changes in the law for 1982 and that the savings would increase to $155 million in 1985. The agency has never been very successful in applied science, which should be left to private industry. Industry should be given incentives to support science and engineering education. Behavioral science is of questionable value and unworthy of support. Private industry has not been aggressive in exploiting scientific advances. American training in technology and science is falling behind that of the Russians, Japanese and Germans. University laboratories are unable to keep pace in international competition because their facilities have deterioriated. Probable opponents are social scientists and science educators, members of Congress interested in promoting the women's and minorities' program and scientists who oppose loss of money for new equipment. POSTAL SERVICE Since it was reorganized in 1971 the United States Postal Service has been an independent agency overseen by a Board of Governors appointed by the President and assisted by a Federal payment. The annual payment, initially $920 million, began declining last year by 10 percent a year, or $92 million, and the decline is to continue each year under current law. The Administration wants to speed the cuts in support payments, reducing outlays $250 million this year, and increasing the reduction each year until the cut is $779 million in 1985. The Administration would also cut another category of Federal support that subsidizes certain business mailers and nonprofit mailers, particularly publishers of periodicals. The saving would be minimal when compared with the Postal Service's budget of about $17 billion annually, but the reduction could trigger some service cuts, such as elimination of Saturday mail delivery. The elimination of the subsidy would speed the Postal Service along the path toward self-sufficiency and would force it to improve productivity and shift costs to customers faster. Postmaster General William F. Bolger said he would not oppose a cut of $250 million a year. Cuts in service, such as elimination of delivery on Saturdays, would speed the decline of the Postal Service, reduce its appeal to mailers and ultimately make its fees rise too fast. Probable opponents are direct-mail advertisers and business mailers. MASS TRANSIT The Government provides operating assistance to help hold down local fares and capital grants for the construction of mass transit facilities such as rail lines and for the purchase of rail cars and buses. The financing comes in two forms: funds distributed to localities according to a formula that takes population density into account and discretionary grants for which cities apply. The Carter Administration proposed to spend $2.7 billion on capital needs and $750 million for operating help this year. The President would reduce outlays by $31 million this year and $270 million next year. Operating help would be eliminated by 1985. He also would have the Government start no new mass transit rail projects. Present construction projects would be continued only if short-term benefits exceeded short-term costs. The Government would hold annual outlays to about $2.4 billion from now to 1985, saving up to $1.5 billion a year by 1985. Mass transit is mostly a state and local responsibility. Excessive capital expansion contributes to operating deficits, which build increased demand for Federal assistance. There are other less capital-intensive ways to help mass transit such as carpooling, vanpooling and jitney services. Postponement of capital projects adds to future costs because of inflation. Expansion of mass transit is unavoidable because of the growing need for more efficient use of energy. Probable opponents are some cities and states. ARTS, HUMANITIES, BROADCASTING The National Endowment for the Arts provides grants to encourage the development of arts and culture and generate private contributions in those areas. Its budget is $173 million in the next fiscal year. The National Endowment for the Humanities provides similar grants for studies in such areas as philosophy and translation. Its budget is $165 million. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides assistance to 378 noncommercial radio and television stations. Its budget is about $200 million. The budgets of both endowments would be cut by about half. The budget of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be cut by about a quarter in the next fiscal year and more in subsequent years.  The savings would be $87 million in arts, $84 million in humanities and about $50 million in broadcasting. Federal support has led organizations involved in the arts and humanities to rely on public money rather than private contributions. If the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cut back on administrative costs and national programming, support of local stations would not have to be reduced. In a time of budgetary restraint, support in these areas is a relatively low priority. Projects that help reflect the diversity of the country would be shelved. Private money would dry up in the absence of public seed money. An important alternative to commercial radio and television would be harmed. Probable opponents are scholars and artists, corporations that contribute in these areas and universities. SYNTHETIC FUELS Last June President Carter signed legislation creating the Synthetic Fuels Corporation to act as a catalyst for creating a huge new industry of commercial plants, based on oil shale and coal. It has $20 billion available through 1984, an amount that could swell upon review to $88 billion. Much of this money comes from the ''windfall profits'' tax on oil, and most of it is expected to be used to guarantee commercial loans. In addition, the Department of Energy finances research and development projects in synthetic fuels. Eliminate nearly all direct subsidies for a half-dozen major synthetic fuels projects supported by the Department of Energy, transferring them to the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, which may or may not provide loan guarantees or other aid. Money for the $1.4 billion coal liquefaction plant to be built in West Virginia, would continue to be provided in the current fiscal year because of the participation of West Germany and Japan. The Administration estimates that the ''duplicative'' projects for which subsidies are being dropped would have cost taxpayers at least $2.7 billion over the next five years, perhaps twice as much if cost over-runs followed historic paterns. Duplications in Government programs would be eliminated. The need to reduce the country's dependence on foreign fuels demands that plants be built to prove their technological and commercial feasibility. Probable opponents are companies involved in synthetic fuels development and politicians worried about projects to be built in their districts and the nation's dependence on foreign oil.        </p>

	data-description="  MEDICAID A joint Federal-state program that pays doctor, hospital, nursing home and other health costs of the poor. The Federal share ranges from 50 to 70 percent, with the highest proportion going to states with the lowest per-capita income. Within broad Federal guidelines, states set rules for eligibility, covered services and payment rates. Eligible persons are entitled to have their bills paid, whatever the total cost. Spending has risen more than 15 percent a year over the last five years, primarily because of higher health costs, and the program would cost the Government more than $18 billion in the fiscal year 1982 if no changes were made. President Reagan would reduce the anticipated Federal grants to the states by $100 million in the current fiscal year and by $1 billion in 1982. After that, the Federal contribution to the program would rise at the same rate as the inflation rate in the economy. States would have to make up the difference, either by changing eligibility requirements, reducing payment rates or making their programs more efficient. States such as New York with the most generous rules would lose the most Federal dollars. Spending would be reduced by $1 billion below current estimates in 1982 and the savings would increase each year until they reached $5 billion in 1985."></div>
