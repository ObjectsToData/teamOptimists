Last month, when a White House committee praised 218 commmunity arts programs around the nation in a report titled "Growing Up Taller," it was the only New Jersey project mentioned.</p><p>The New Jersey Council for the Humanities runs the program with an annual budget of $30,000, taking it to schools, libraries, churches, homeless shelters  and prisons. Groups meet once a week for two months, reading short stories and discussing them with a trained coordinator. They are encouraged to compare the stories to their own lives, to connect with the characters and with other program members.</p><p>The stories are chosen for their brevity -- they cannot exceed 10 pages -- and their relevance to the lives of the readers, many of whom are black and Hispanic. Recent selections have included Tillie Olsen's "I Stand Here Ironing," Langston Hughes' "Thank You Ma'am" and Grace Paley's "A Conversation With My Father."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Sarah Hirschman, a Princeton resident who has studied literature for much of  her life, developed the program while she was living in Cambridge, Mass., in the early 70's.</p><p>"My friends in academia said it would never work," Mrs. Hirschman said last week. "They thought it crazy to expect people who had never read anything before to read high literature."</p><p>But the experiment was a success, and in 1974, after Mrs. Hirschman had moved to New Jersey, she started a People and Stories program at a Trenton church. Seven years later, a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities helped her organize programs in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Puerto Rico.</p><p>In 1985, when the New Jersey Council for the Humanities started providing funds, Mrs. Hirschman started the first English-language program in Princeton. Patricia Andres, a Lawrenceville resident who is a doctoral candidate in English at Rutgers University, became the co-director in 1993, and People and Stories has since expanded to 22 programs in cities and suburbs around the state. Many groups are multigenerational, multicultural or both. At the Somerset County Jail, the program has become so popular that prisoners are choosing it over television.</p><p>Mrs. Hirschman is hoping to expand the program to reach more teen-agers, substance abusers, parents who lack basic literacy skills and women who are making the transition from welfare to work. She is hoping for a budget of more than $100,000 a year, a sum that could not come entirely from the humanities council, which has a budget of just under $1 million and supports a number of projects.</p><p>People and Stories is different from most literacy programs because it uses stories instead of textbooks. The focus on discussion, rather than reading and writing, encourages participants to offer their thoughts and opinions, Mrs. Hirschman said.</p><p>"People who haven't heard themselves speak in public about complex subjects learn to feel better about themselves," she said. "And since the stories don't lend themselves to cliches, they really delve into their souls instead of giving stock answers."</p><p>Mrs. Hirschman said the program's main goal is introducing disadvantaged people to literature and showing them how it reflects their lives. But it also develops critical thinking skills, self esteem and respect for cultural and economic differences, she said.</p><p>"Metaphor cuts across economic and educational levels," Mrs. Andres said. "It erases our differences, because we're responding at a spiritual level."</p><p>That does not mean every story has a transforming effect. There are class clowns who crack jokes at the characters' expense. There are daydreamers who stare at the floor and mumble when questioned. But for the most part, the group  members listen intently while a story is read, then jump into discussion. Their  comments are often as funny as they are thoughtful.</p><p>But in the end -- and this is the key to the program's success, Mrs. Hirschman says -- the discussion inevitably turns to the participants' own lives, taking on the air of a group therapy session. One group met in Trenton last week to read "American History" by Judith Ortiz-Cofer, set on the day President Kennedy was killed. The members, who are recovering from substance abusers, offered their memories of the assassination. They also dissected the main character, an Hispanic teen-ager who lives in a housing project and suffers the effects of prejudice.</p><p>"You put yourself in the character's shoes and use their story as a lesson,"  said one member, Dwight Townes. "If it touches you in a certain way, it can change your life. It can lift you up."</p>                </div>
