    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Like practically everyone who had ever driven through the Russell neighborhood near downtown Louisville, Ky., John I. Gilderbloom, an associate professor of economics and urban policy at the University of Louisville, was struck by the community's decay: trash-strewn lots, abandoned houses and drug haunts popping up behind boarded-up windows. It was a familiar portrait of inner-city American poverty, unemployment, crime and despair.     But in the early 1990's, Dr. Gilderbloom, 43, saw something else in the neighborhood: an opportunity. He could turn the considerable resources of an urban research university to the problems of the Russell neighborhood while giving some of his students a chance to test textbook theories in practice. And just as important, he said, the challenge could help build their characters and better prepare them to face formidable realworld problems.  ">

                    <p>Like practically everyone who had ever driven through the Russell neighborhood near downtown Louisville, Ky., John I. Gilderbloom, an associate professor of economics and urban policy at the University of Louisville, was struck by the community's decay: trash-strewn lots, abandoned houses and drug haunts popping up behind boarded-up windows. It was a familiar portrait of inner-city American poverty, unemployment, crime and despair.</p><p>But in the early 1990's, Dr. Gilderbloom, 43, saw something else in the neighborhood: an opportunity. He could turn the considerable resources of an urban research university to the problems of the Russell neighborhood while giving some of his students a chance to test textbook theories in practice. And just as important, he said, the challenge could help build their characters and better prepare them to face formidable realworld problems.</p><p>Under his leadership, the Housing and Neighborhood Development Strategies program began in 1993 with the intention of improving the quality of life for Russell residents. The program, back by Federal and local government and civic groups, placed Dr. Gilderbloom and his students in the middle of a struggle to redevelop the troubled community.</p><p>''It has been a tremendous experience for them,'' Dr. Gilderbloom said of his cadre of 50 graduate and undergraduate students whose work over the years in the neighborhood has helped bring it hundreds of new homes, new jobs and new hope. As a result, the professor added: ''I think they'll be better citizens. I think they'll function much better in the real world.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>And his students agree. ''It's been real, real, real,'' said Latondra Jones, a 25-year-old native of Louisville who is completing her master's degree in public administration. ''It's made me more well-rounded. I see myself growing.''</p><p>In recent years, as the demands and definitions of success have grown more complex, American college educators have been rethinking their mission to students. No longer is it enough, many of them say, simply to equip graduates with the academic skills necessary to excel in their chosen careers.</p><p>''People want to hire people who have integrity, are team players, who are socially responsible, because they have gotten into a lot of trouble with people who weren't,'' said Daniel L. Ritchie, Chancellor of the University of Denver and the former chief executive of Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable Inc. ''We don't want to graduate barracudas.''</p><p>As the class of 2000 prepares to enter college this fall, there is a great deal of discussion in higher education about how the whole student must be educated. Educators like the late Ernest L. Boyer, who was president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, have raised the issue and the stakes for colleges. In his article ''Creating the New American College,'' published two years ago in the Journal of Higher Education, he argued that higher education must pay much more attention in preparing students to be responsible citizens, and not strictly scholars and professionals.</p><p>Portland State University, a public research university in Oregon with 15,000 students, reworked its undergraduate curriculum in 1993 so that today it ''promotes social responsibility, respect for diversity and a commitment to lifelong learning,'' said a university spokeswoman.</p><p>Lloyd Jacobson, the national programs director of Campus Outreach Opportunity League, which promotes the expansion of college-based community service projects, said he has noticed a sea change in how colleges are encouraging students to learn through real-world experiences.</p><p>''It is as different as night and day,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''I think that people still hold up the 60's as the litmus test, but I think the difference between the 80's and the 90's, in the numbers of campuses that have esstablished these kinds of programs, is tremendous.''</p><p>That idea is increasingly finding expressions in scores of revamped freshmen orientation programs with emphasis placed on guidance, student seminars about character and values, renewed interests in off-campus volunteerism and the new popularity of college speakers who preach an old-fashioned sermon on the virtues of compassion, community service and the value of giving with no expectation of reward.</p><p>Shannon Swanson, a Japanese language major at Indiana University in Bloomington, said she was required to take diversity training in preparation for being resident assistant in her dormitory. Ms. Swanson, who grew up in Valparaiso, Ind., said she learned a lot more than she had expected.</p><p>''I was surprised that people on my floor had never talked to a gay person before,'' the 19-year-old junior recalled. ''A lot of white kids on my floor had never talked to a black person before.''</p><p>A random roommate selection policy assigned her to an openly bisexual woman. ''She thinks differently than I do about some things,'' said Ms. Swanson, who is not bisexual. ''But 95 percent of the things we do are the same.''</p><p>With ambitions of becoming an international businesswoman, Ms. Swanson said learning to be comfortable with all kinds of people on campus will be as important an asset as her financial acumen.</p>                </div>
