    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THEY CALL IT ''SENDING THE LIMO.'' IT'S THE phrase Ivy League admissions officers use when a school outside the league tries to lure away a top student with a lavish deal. There is still talk at Columbia, for instance, about Kevin Seal, who was accepted into the class of 1997 from Indian Hills High School near Cincinnati (terrific board scores; editor of the school newspaper; proficient on saxophone, bassoon, oboe and piano). Kevin's father, who owns a small software firm, balked when Columbia offered his son no financial aid. So Kevin is now a senior at Indiana University, where he enjoys an all-expense paid deal.    Then there's the more recent case of Nikia Scott, an outstanding  student, actress and track star from Stone Mountain High School in Atlanta. Nikia got in everywhere she applied last year, including Columbia and Yale -- each of which offered her about $18,000 toward the total annual cost of $30,000. Nikia's father makes a modest salary as a teacher in a high-school R.O.T.C. program and her mother has been concerned about losing her accounting job at the local Air Force base. Worried that Ivy League bills would drive their daughter into debt, they persuaded her to go to Howard University, which is paying full costs.  ">

Nikia's father makes a modest salary as a teacher in a high-school R.O.T.C. program and her mother has been concerned about losing her accounting job at the local Air Force base. Worried that Ivy League bills would drive their daughter into debt, they persuaded her to go to Howard University, which is paying full costs.</p><p>Not every such story ends with an Ivy League loss. This year, Cristina Teuscher, a graduate of New Rochelle, N.Y., High School who won a gold medal on the United States Olympic swimming team, is coming to Columbia. Stanford and U.S.C. went after her with full athletic scholarships, but at the last minute she turned them down -- even though, since her father is a doctor, she's getting practically nothing from Columbia and her family will be spending some $120,000 to send her there.</p><p>What explains the disparity between how much these students are wanted (a lot) and how much scholarship money they are offered (often very little) is an Ivy League policy called ''need blind'' admissions and ''need based'' financial aid. ''Need blind'' means that no qualified student is turned away because of inability to pay. ''Need based'' means that no family is asked to pay more than it can reasonably afford or gets more than it reasonably requires. The hard part, of course, is deciding what's ''reasonable.'' To do so, all Ivy League schools send out a questionnaire that has become a feared document in the lives of many Americans -- a form asking about salary and pensions, the appraised value of the family home, mortgage balance, investments, insurance and so on. But a worse fate may be in store: in part because of the ferocious competition for students like Kevin Seal, Nikia Scott and Cristina Teuscher, the era of need-blind admissions and need-based aid may be coming to an end.</p>                </div>

                    <p>For centuries, Ivy League colleges had no real policy for giving out aid because they gave relatively little and because no one thought much about it. Their students came from a tight social circle -- a fact that Thomas Jefferson, looking northward toward the spires of New England, attributed to a system of ''traditionary reverence for certain families.'' This tradition continued pretty much unchallenged until the 1930's when a chemist named James Bryant Conant became president of Harvard.</p><p>Until Conant's day, recalled the historian Theodore H. White (Harvard '38), the few students of modest means at Harvard were called ''meatballs'' and regarded by some as ''a zoo of specimens of the mobile lower middle class.'' Conant believed in equal opportunity as a democratic principle. And in the face of what he considered the challenge posed by the Soviet ''citadel of learning,'' he warned against keeping talented students out of America's best institutions because they happened to come from low economic or social circumstances. To open up his own school, he knew he needed a professional admissions staff -- something unknown in the days when Harvard relied for most of its students on nearby prep schools, to which F. Scott Fitzgerald had given the generic name ''St. Midas.''</p><p>When Harvard took its first tentative steps away from ''St. Midas,'' the rest of the Ivy League followed. Through its national network of Harvard Clubs, alumni were pressed into service to go into previously untapped schools in search of academic talent. As standards rose and the applicant pool became nationwide, the new admissions office had to decide not just whom to let in but according to what principles of financial aid. ''If we give a very needy student, out of old habit, a tuition scholarship of $600 when he really needs $800, it may be very hard indeed for him,'' observed John U. Monro, a Harvard dean who conducted the first serious re-evaluation in the history of American higher education of how students were expected to pay. ''Two hundred dollars extra means much to this man. On the other hand, there is the man who needs a $400 or $500 scholarship, and out of old habit we may give him a tuition award of $600. If we do, we just give him extra spending money. It is up to us to spot the difference.''</p><p>This principle has become so fundamental to the process of need-based financial aid that it can be properly called the Monro Doctrine. Today the Monro Doctrine is in trouble.</p>                </div>
