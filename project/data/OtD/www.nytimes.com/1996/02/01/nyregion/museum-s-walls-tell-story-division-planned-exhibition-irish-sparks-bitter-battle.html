Now  some organizations will not loan their treasures, scholars will not lend their voices, musicians have refused to perform.

                    <p>The exhibition was to be a milestone, a joyous event for the Irish in New York City. Instead, the show has become the center of a bitter battle between the museum that would present it and some in the community it would portray.</p><p>The furor began last year, when a respected Irish-American scholar was replaced as guest curator of "Gaelic Gotham: A History of the Irish in New York." With a flurry of phone calls and meetings, a protest sprang to life. Now  some organizations will not loan their treasures, scholars will not lend their voices, musicians have refused to perform. And an exhibition that would be the largest ever on the history of New York's Irish is being jeopardized before ever opening its doors.</p><p>Critics contend that the Museum of the City of New York is presenting "Gaelic Gotham" without the input of Irish-American history's top scholars. And  though they can only speculate on its content, they fear the show will be dogged by misrepresentations and stereotypes. So heated has the dispute become that an  ad hoc coalition of roughly 30 Irish-American writers, labor organizers and historians gathered at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel three weeks ago and voted to demand the exhibition be canceled pending "some meaningful outreach" from the museum to the community, John T. McInerney, a coalition spokesman, said.</p><p>Robert R. Macdonald, the museum's director, insists "Gaelic Gotham" is based  on solid scholarship by distinguished historians and will open on March 13 as scheduled.</p>                </div>

                    <p>On its face, the clash mirrors other recent ones over how institutions portray history, from the Enola Gay controversy last year at the Smithsonian Institution, which angered veterans by trying to spur public scrutiny of the use of atomic weapons in World War II, to a show on slavery at the Library of Congress that closed shortly after opening in December amid complaints from black staff members about its subject matter.</p><p>And in New York, concern about how an ethnic group's history is presented has engulfed projects ranging from exhibits at Ellis Island to the preservation of the African Burial Ground in Lower Manhattan.</p><p>Museum officials say the campaign against "Gaelic Gotham" is akin to tossing  a book on a bonfire. "In the face of the quite extraordinary accusations made against the museum, let the exhibition speak for itself," Mr. Macdonald said. "We will not be intimidated. No one can claim they own the history of the Irish  in New York, and we'll stand by the scholarship of this show."</p><p>But for Brendan Fay, an Irish-American educator and gay-rights advocate who helped organize the community meetings, the heart of the dispute is far less ominous: the need for a people to have a role in telling their own story.</p><p>"The telling of the story is very important and very sacred," Mr. Fay said, "because often the storytellers, whether they're from Hollywood or Madison Avenue, their telling often collapses the richness and all the different shades  of a people's lives into simplicity. We rarely get the chance to tell our own story and in such a public way. Maybe that's why it's so important."</p><p>Planning for the exhibition began in 1991, when the museum approached the National Endowment for the Humanities for financing. In 1994, the N.E.H. approved a $250,000 grant and pledged $50,000 in matching funds, the largest ever awarded the museum, Gary Krull, an endowment spokesman, said.</p><p>Marion Casey, an archivist considered a pre-eminent voice on Irish-American history, was the show's guest curator. Ms. Casey, 33, and her supporters contend that the bulk of the final proposal was her work, reflecting research for her dissertation at New York University. Mr. Macdonald says that the proposal was a  team effort and that when the museum tried to negotiate a new contract with Ms.  Casey, it could not agree to her demands that she owned the show and should have final say.</p><p>Ms. Casey says she merely asked to share the show's copyright, a condition from a previous contract. Instead, she was offered a lesser role than that of guest curator and then was told last May she was no longer on the team.</p><p>Still, "It hasn't been about Marion Casey for months and months," Ms. Casey said. "The biggest slight is the dismissal of the most recent scholarship. It's  been compounded by the museum's refusal to acknowledge that the community has a  voice and has a right to say what goes on the museum's walls."</p><p>The fact that Ms. Casey would no longer play a role led several renowned historians to withdraw as consultants, including Kerby Miller, an author and professor of history at the University of Missouri-Columbia, and Ronald Bayor, co-editor of the forthcoming book "The New York Irish," to be published by Johns Hopkins University Press this winter.</p><p>They were replaced by historians whom critics say may be experts in their own fields but are not considered specialists on Irish-American history. That team includes Dr. Edward T. O'Donnell, an assistant professor at Hunter College who has taught Irish-American history and specializes in labor and politics, and Dr. Jack Salzman of the Jewish Museum, whose expertise is the history of ethnic relations in New York City.</p>                </div>
