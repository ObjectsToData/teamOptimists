A report by the American Symphony Orchestra League has suggested that orchestras consider playing more pop and ethnic music to attract diverse audiences. The National Endowment for the Arts, a bureaucracy hobbled by budget cuts and controversy, sees its effectiveness slip away, while the arts lobby grows more distraught.</p><p>The major institutions, wondering where the next generation of audiences is  coming from, are raising education budgets to compensate for public schools' failings. Paintings and operas tend to become more explicitly political as other aspects of the artistic enterprise are devalued. In the universities, the concept of "masterpiece" has been challenged. Music ensembles try to redefine themselves in a more popular mode; theaters mount revivals; classical record companies worry what to do as recordings of Beethoven's Fifth proliferate.</p><p>Last week some hard data, in the form of two studies commissioned by the N.E.A., emerged to support the anecdotal evidence circulated in recent years like a hospital chart among interns. "Age and Arts Participation with a Focus on the Baby Boom Cohort: 1982-1992," was based on interviews with 10,000 American adults.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Judith H. Balfe, a sociologist at the City University of New York's College of Staten Island and a co-author of the report, said she found "many simply with no interest in these arts, others with real hostility toward them." Richard A. Peterson, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University and another writer of the report, which tracked the decrease in attendance along generational lines, said  he sees a "massive shift in taste and tradition" as pop music and mass culture displace arts once considered among humanity's highest accomplishments. Yet another study on art-related philanthropy, commissioned by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, makes dire predictions including a "decline in the notion of stewardship, of civic culture itself."</p><p>Far from surprising anyone, these findings seemed to confirm experience. An earlier N.E.A. report, "Arts Participation in America, 1982-1992," singled out the level of education as the most important variable affecting participation in the arts. The current report argues that the notion doesn't seem to hold for highly educated baby boomers and suggests that education may have changed during that postwar span. The proportion of the population that has had music lessons,  for example, dropped to 40 percent in 1992 from 47 percent in 1982. The decline  in public school arts education is a harbinger of more severe problems.</p><p>Such a decline, however, may be a symptom rather than a cause. Consider, for  example, the supposed anomalies turned up by the surveys. The most important is  that while concert halls and theaters are facing problems, art museums are booming. In 1992, an estimated 49.6 million people visited museums, compared with 36.2 million in 1982, an increase of 37 percent. Older baby boomers and adults born between 1966 and 1975 are the two biggest age groups in art museums.</p><p>This may be due in part to our culture's increasing emphasis on the visual, its preoccupation with imagery on television and in movies. Museums may also demand a lower commitment of money and time than a concert or theater, involve less planning and require little, if any risk of being imprisoned in unpleasantness. They have showed marketing savvy, creating audio-tours, gift shops, restaurants and blockbuster shows.</p><p>Fleeting Experience</p><p>None of these explanations, however, guarantee a very deep involvement with  the visual arts as arts. And it doesn't feel as if Americans are in the midst of a renaissance. If anything, the urgency with which museums are developing educational programs reveals an anxiety about the depth of that involvement. A visit may offer some museumgoers a kind of freedom and intermittent involvement  that is closer in spirit to the kind of exposure that listeners have to classical music on television, radio or compact discs -- areas that have also shown growth.</p><p>The N.E.A. report notes, for example, that "video consumption" of classical music is high for the same age groups that show declines in attendance at concerts. Recordings have also become more important as a replacement for the live experience. Moreover, between 1982 and 1992, the audiences for classical music and jazz on the radio grew by more than 50 percent.</p><p>But this good news may also be bad news: music on the radio is listened to more passively. The quality of classical music radio has also declined significantly; stations have closed, selections are shorter, vocal music is rare, popular classics dominate. The numbers may be going up, but the nature of  the experience is not the same.</p><p>Television viewing is also no panacea for the arts and seems far less central than the report suggests. Forty years ago, NBC could sponsor an orchestra and broadcast Toscanini's concerts; there is no commercial network that would even consider such an undertaking today.</p><p>So things may be even worse than they appear in the surveys taken by the N.E.A. The only place where the reports seem overly pessimistic is opera: opera  has been thriving, partly because of simultaneous translations, the appeal of traditional drama on a large scale, and new works that address, however fitfully, contemporary political themes.</p><p>One reason for the crisis in the arts may be another aspect of the arts that  surveys cannot examine: their achievement. Museums thrive on collections of masterpieces and their fate does not depend on new acquisitions. But concert halls and theaters require either important new works (which have failed to find large audiences or stir much passion) or compelling interpreters (who are far less plentiful than they were a generation ago). The lapse in education, the uncertainty in artistic achievement, the worries over audience attendance and the lack of visionary patrons may all be signs of a vast change in the Western artistic tradition itself.</p><p>Of course there has always been a complicated relationship between the high and low in culture, and much that is now central to high culture has also appealed to mass audiences. But now the very notion of high artistic achievement is often regarded as a chimera and the products of these long and sophisticated Western traditions are often treated as if they have no greater claim on America's attention than the latest music video.  Such attitudes, just  by being made, already prove that the arts can no longer assume stability. Popular culture will thrive, but aspirations for greater accomplishment, once expected from the citizens of a democracy, are deflected, even resented. We are  now suspicious of anything that smacks too much of elitism. It may be that the crisis in the arts is democracy's revenge.</p><p>Photos: At art museums, attendance is up, but concert halls andtheaters are struggling.
