With the old version condemned as giving short shrift to figures and events that have traditionally been emphasized, the new version adds material like a more detailed treatment of the Declaration of Independence and the role of George Washington, and a continuing emphasis on the role of science, mathematics, medicine and technology. It adds a consideration of the motivation  for migration to North America from Europe in the colonial era, and incorporates specific acknowledgments of the positive aspects of agricultural and industrial  modernization.

It adds a consideration of the motivation  for migration to North America from Europe in the colonial era, and incorporates specific acknowledgments of the positive aspects of agricultural and industrial  modernization.</p><p>Here and there, wording that some found objectionable has been omitted. Students are no longer asked to evaluate "why the Republican Party abandoned African-Americans in the South" during Reconstruction. Instead, they are asked to "analyze how shared values of the North and South limited support for social  and racial democratization."</p><p>The new standards, which are the product of months of review and study by historians and teachers, are being issued by the National Center for History in  the Schools at the University of California at Los Angeles. They combine into one volume the standards for United States and world history from kindergarten through high school, originally published in three separate volumes.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The teaching examples will be published separately next summer as classroom aids, without the stamp of being national standards.</p><p>Christopher T. Cross, president of the Council for Basic Education, a national nonprofit group that promotes the teaching of basic subjects, praised the revised standards yesterday as "an excellent blueprint for coverage of material in U.S. and world history."</p><p>The council, with financing from the Pew Charitable Trust, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Spencer Foundation commissioned two independent panels of historians, teachers and school administrators last June to study the standards. Many of the changes they proposed have been taken into account in the new version.</p><p>The council recommended dispensing with the teaching examples that had been the target of much of the criticism. In doing so, it recognized that many of the examples were excellent, like one inviting high school students "analyze within  its historical context the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan," taking into account the Allied military position in the Pacific in 1945, estimated military and civilian casualties in a prolonged war, long-term consequences as understood in 1945, Japanese surrender overtures and the probability of Soviet entry into the war.</p><p>But now and then, students would be invited "to make facile moral judgments," it said, citing a classroom teaching example that suggested that students "conduct a trial of John D. Rockefeller" on a charge of participating in unethical and amoral business practices designed to undermine fair competition.</p><p>The standards had come under the harshest attack from Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, who said the American history standards presented a warped view, ignoring the nation's white, male heroes. She said the document contained  17 references to the Ku Klux Klan and 19 to McCarthyism but none to Paul Revere  or Thomas A. Edison.</p><p>In appraising the history standards, the independent panels told the Council  on Basic Education that dispensing with the teaching examples would "eliminate many of the problems related to the absence or presence of individual names, since the standards themselves name relatively few historical figures."</p><p>"The teaching of history within the general frame proposed by the standards will necessarily include examples of individuals with varying degrees of influence on the events of their own time," the panels noted.  "But it is not the job of the standards to provide a list."</p><p>The council said states, districts, professional organizations and others should develop examples for teachers as a separate supplement to revised history standards. "There will always be conflicting interpretations about the meaning of history," it said. "In history, no historian, no book -- not even proposed national standards -- ever has the final word."</p><p>In the revised version of the standards, which set out voluntary goals for education but are not a curriculum, the first era of United States history has been expanded to include Portuguese colonialization in the Americas, consideration of slavery in Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries and changes in Western Europe in the age of exploration, including dissent within the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>During colonization and settlement from 1585 to 1763, the revised standards add that "students first need to understand what induced hundreds of thousands of free and indentured immigrants to leave their homelands in many parts of Europe.  Why did they risk the hardships of resettlement overseas, and how well  did they succeed?"</p><p>And in the period from 1754 to the 1820's, the standards have said from the first that "the American Revolution is of signal importance," but the revised version spells it out: "In thinking about the causes and course of the Revolution, it is important to study the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Independence."</p><p>Gary B. Nash, co-director of the history standards project, said yesterday that he was pleased by the additions to the standards.</p><p>"I do think the standards are improved," Mr. Nash said. "They've added material that's important."</p><p>He went on to add that more than 32,000 teachers had bought the original version, at $18.95 for each paperback copy, and that "I still haven't had any requests for sending their money back."</p><p>Joyce Appleby, a professor of history at U.C.L.A. and president-elect of the  American Historical Association, said yesterday: "My impression, from talking to teachers, is that they're dying of thirst for some guidance and some knowledge of the scholarship of the last 20 or 30 years which has enriched our understanding. This needs to get into the classroom."</p><p>Ms. Appleby said she viewed the revised standards as an improvement, but added: "I was very pleased with the original one. Lynne Cheney is not a professional historian. You couldn't name more than five historians who would criticize them."</p>                </div>
