Among sober offerings like "Evil and Suffering in the West," the school's catalogue now lists "Sports as a Metaphor for Life" and "Television and Religion in American Society."</p><p>Small, private liberal arts colleges are the most adventurous (unhinged, some critics would say) in describing their offerings. For the most part, major universities still list straightforward, sometimes dreary-sounding course titles like "Money and Banking," "The History of Canada" and "Medieval Latin."</p>                </div>

                    <p>In today's private liberal arts catalogues, course titles may be imaginative, like "For Every Pharaoh There Is a Moses" (Amherst College), slangy, as in "Girl Talk" (Wesleyan University), and bombastic, like "Contemporary Hysteria: The Drama of Righteous Gullibility" (Bennington College).</p><p>The pharaoh-Moses course deals with the work of modern Islamic writers; "Girl Talk" focuses on Virginia Woolf and Oscar Wilde (yes, Oscar Wilde, who would not have found the characterization amusing), and the hysteria course argues the thesis that "the greatest period of hysteria and witch hunting in this country's history is happening now."</p><p>Some educators see such course titles as the natural result of a system that  pressures professors to market themselves and their courses. Colleges rely on faculty members, not administrators, to name courses.</p><p>"The cutesy-fication of course titles is practiced most by departments afraid of losing students," said Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas who studies the academic profession. "If they lose too many  students, their courses can be canceled."</p><p>Others say that teaching has been profoundly changed by the growth of knowledge and that course descriptions have changed in consequence.</p><p>"A course on the United States in the 1880's and 1890's frequently used to be called 'The Gilded Age,' " said Stanley Katz, the president of the American Council of Learned Societies. "But today if that course has been expanded to include popular culture, the role of women and so forth, the old title is misleading. Some of these new titles are just truth in advertising."</p><p>Another stimulus is the hotly controversial form of relativism known in academic circles as "pomo," or more formally post-modernism.</p><p>David Bernstein, a professor of history and art history at Sarah Lawrence who teaches a course titled "The Unity of the Arts/The Discord of the World," dealing with Renaissance Rome and with medieval France and Rome,explained the approach this way:</p><p>"We're now much happier with eclecticism, more tolerant of a variety of approaches, than we used to be. And so these course titles try to suggest unresolved tensions characteristic of post-modernist thought rather than simply  to give the answers."</p><p>Those are fighting words to Gertrude Himmelfarb, the neoconservative writer and emeritus professor of history at the Graduate Center Program in History at the City University of New York.</p><p>"The use of irony and wordplay in these course titles," Miss Himmelfarb said, "is a post-modernist trick to suggest multiple meanings and complexity where in  fact there is very little.</p><p>"All it does is confuse students as to what the content of the course may actually be. Many of these courses are completely vacuous. They're a terrible, terrible waste of time in a young person's life."</p><p>Also dubious about the trend is Mark Ryan, a specialist in the history of higher education in the United States who serves on a Yale University faculty committee that reviews new course proposals.</p><p>"We find ourselves putting some reins on course titles and descriptions in the interest of comprehensibility," Mr. Ryan said. "In addition, sometimes faculty who deal with their subject over a period of years begin to focus on a marginal aspect of it or take an idiosyncratic view of the material that is not  helpful to students. Those impulses must be restrained."</p><p>W. B. Carnochan, a professor emeritus of the humanities at Stanford University and a student of college curriculums, said the new course titles were not objectionable and might borrow from fashionable television commercials that challenge viewers to decode them.</p><p>"You look at a Budweiser or Nike commercial and you have a hard time connecting what you see with the product," Mr. Carnochan said. "The object is to get you to think, and it would seem that scholars have borrowed that technique.  It's not all bad."</p><p>Some course titles seem intended to lure students by being relevant and current. For example, the department of economics at Swarthmore College keeps students up-to-the-minute and then some with courses like "The United States Economy and Economic Thought: Roosevelt Through Clinton" and "Economics of the 21st Century."</p><p>Nor have professors been oblivious to the power of sex. At Wesleyan, students can sign up for an English course called "History of Sex," which delves into "the history and representation of sex in Europe and North America." Also at Wesleyan, the department of Asian languages offers "Love and Sex in Japanese Literature."</p><p>Bowdoin offers "Representations of Sex and Sexuality in Spanish Novels and Films," which might be even more attractive were it not conducted only in Spanish.</p><p>Skidmore College puts a literary spin on the subject with "Self and Desire: A Study of Don Juan." Swarthmore's English department offers "Renaissance Sexualities," which explores "the homoerotic, chastity and friendship, marriage, adultery and incest."</p><p>Not to be left out, Swarthmore's history department has come up with "Sex, Sin and Kin in Early Europe." Duke University's department of anthropology takes the long view with "Sexuality in Global Perspective."</p><p>The new currency of the word "queer" is reflected in many catalogues, like "Queer Texts and Contexts," at Swarthmore's English department, and "Thinking Queer," at Bowdoin's.</p><p>Some colleges and universities seem fixated on certain locutions. Washington  and Lee University seems intent on turning out cadres of generalists with courses like "General Biology," "General Botany," and "General Chemistry."</p><p>Smith College is similarly basic, with "Introduction to Psychology," "Introduction to Biology," "Introduction to Astronomy," "Introduction to Sociology" and "Introduction to History."</p><p>Only Smith's physics department seems to have broken the mold, offering an introductory course called "Principles of Physics: Seven Ideas That Shook the Universe."</p><p>Photo: Some say the unusual course titles are a matter of marketing;others say they reflect the growth of knowledge.        </p>                </div>
