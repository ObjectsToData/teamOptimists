    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="ONCE the trolley line was connected, Bridgeport residents of modest means could, for a mere 5 cents, enjoy a day at a Fairfield beach. The idea was so magnetic that by 1897 a summer colony known as &quot;Little Bridgeport&quot; had sprung up -- beachside cottages built off Reef Road by the trolley crowd. The trolley had  created a new way of life, making it convenient to live in one place (suburban Fairfield) and work in another (Bridgeport).         In &quot;Taking the Trolley: Bridgeport and Fairfield 1875-1925,&quot; an exhibition at the Fairfield Historical Society through Nov. 3, ties between the two communities over a 50-year period are explored with an emphasis on the role mass transportation played in their growth. (The society, 636 Old Post Road, Fairfield, is open Monday through Friday, 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M.)   ">

"Bridgeport had an established manufacturing base in metalworking and armaments. It also became a shipping center, particularly after the annexation of Fairfield's Black Rock, which had a very deep harbor.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"Those characteristics remained intact after the trolley was established in the 1890's. But the trolley enabled people to move more easily between the communities. People working in Bridgeport could entertain living in bucolic Fairfield and taking the trolley to work, the hospital, school and shops. They could take advantage of business and commercial opportunities, which were more limited in Fairfield."</p><p>Fairfield grew as the place to live as Bridgeport expanded its industrial base, becoming the country's pre-eminent manufacturer of armaments during World  War I.</p><p>Beyond a small introductory gallery, the exhibition is arranged in two galleries. One focuses on Fairfield, the other on Bridgeport. A full-sized trolley facade filled with hands-on controls and a make-believe track separates  the two.</p><p>The Fairfield side is dominated by a large mural of farmers working an onion  field and antique tools, including an onion seeder, weeding hoe and cultivator.  An improvised field with onions and tools are provided for visitors to try their hand at cultivation.</p><p>Fairfield's main export crop, the Southport globe onion, was grown throughout the town and shipped from the small commercial harbor at Southport, shown lined  with warehouses and a few village stores accommodating basic needs.</p><p>And, it would appear, some things never change. Along with a trolley route map are the reasons townspeople fought the trolley: to keep churches, town houses and homes free "from the invasion of the dangerous trolley," to protect property values and safeguard horses.</p><p>A travelogue of sorts, the exhibition recreates a country club, a beach house hung with old-fashioned swimsuits and the various ways people lived.</p><p>One of the more extensive presentations by the society, it was financed by the Connecticut Humanities Council.</p><p>And the human factor is emphasized. Contributions of a melting pot of immigrants -- Irish, Scandinavians, Italians, Poles and Hungarians, many first-generation Americans, are shown to have influenced the communities. A Hungarian room as well as an Italian section show objects used in everyday lives, rooted in different cultures.</p><p>The yellow and red trolley looms on the Bridgeport side of the exhibition. Step into it, ring the bell, make it go with a control box and stop with a brake handle.</p><p>As the story is told, young people from Fairfield, discouraged by diminishing farming prospects, sought jobs in Bridgeport shops, offices and factories, including the corset manufacturer Warner Brothers Company (today called Warnaco) depicted with photo blowups, sewing machines, tables and fabric in various stages of becoming a corset.</p><p>Crates at an improvised shipping dock hold products made in Bridgeport. One showstopper not in a crate is the turn-of-the-century electric automobile, the Locomobile.</p><p>"Each town had something to offer the other community," Ms. Endslow said. "Because of their different amenities, they had a unique interrelationship. Today it's hard to know where the town line is drawn as people cross to go to the beach, theater, restaurants, museums and concerts."</p><p>Photos: A Fairfield Historical Society exhibition recalls the era when a trolley line opened Fairfield and its beaches to Bridgeport residents, some of whom built homes there.
