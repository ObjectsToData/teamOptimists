                    <p>Nor Tony Martinez, also 13, of White Plains: ''This is all right.'' But as for studying here full time, he said, ''This is too far from my house.''</p><p>Both were students in Christine M. Grandolfo's science class, and they joined other students jostling one another around a table to gather as many dried beans as possible with kitchen utensils.</p><p>''We're studying natural selection,'' said Ms. Grandolfo, who teaches science during the regular school season at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry. ''The beans are the prey, and the utensils are the predators. Those who collect the least die out.''</p><p>While spirits were high, the experiment itself was a metaphor for acquiring as much education as possible from the school's academic enrichment program for minority students.</p><p>Leslie-Ann and Tony were among 34 students from public schools in Westchester and the Bronx who arrive on weekday mornings on the commuter train at nearby Rye station to study the humanities, mathematics, science and computer science.</p><p>Classroom rigors are leavened by frequent dips in the private pool of Frank and Cindy Savage, whose house adjoins the 25-acre campus. The Savages have four children at Rye Country Day School, and a fifth recently graduated from there.</p><p>In addition, the participants in what is formally called the Academic Action Program are treated to such events as trips to West Point, the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, the Smithsonian exhibition at the New York Coliseum and a performance of ''Damn Yankees'' at the Westchester Dinner Theater in Elmsford, which serves lunch instead of dinner to the students.</p><p>''We are providing opportunities that bright, motivated students might not have in their local school districts,'' said Scott N. Nelson, headmaster of the school, which was founded in 1869. ''Very often what we see in the summer are programs more remedial in nature. This has a very different approach. This is for students who want enrichment.''</p><p>Mr. Nelson recalled that when he was growing up he was a financial-aid student, living in Yonkers and studying at the Hackley School in Tarrytown. ''I understand the experience the kids have,'' he said.</p><p>And part of the experience might be a yearning to leave the old neighborhood behind and join the rich and promising environment of the private school. But only an average of one student every two years makes the transition.</p><p>Two who fulfilled that yearning first returned to the summer program as counselors and are now enrolled as regular students at Rye Country where tuition is upward of $14,000 a year.</p><p>''I have more friends in school now,'' said Grace Anderson-Smith, 16, of Mount Vernon. ''One of my best friends is wealthy, but she doesn't flaunt it,'' she said. ''I couldn't be friends with some others who have a different outfit every day and a tan and tell you about weekend trips to Florida and the Bahamas.''</p><p>Grace plays field hockey and basketball and said she hopes to study at Georgetown or Syracuse, probably majoring in business.</p><p>A fellow counselor, Nicole Kirkland, also 16, from Mount Vernon has maintained most of her friendships outside school but said she would like to use her private school education and her cross-country running skills as a springboard to a scholarship at Pennsylvania State University.</p><p>The budget this year for the program, said Alex Weiner, its director, is $26,300 and is provided largely by the school and supplemented by parents of full-time Rye Country students, other residents and a variety of organizations. Also aiding the program are the Benedict Foundation for Independent Schools, Ciba, Citibank and Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Academic Action charges each student $50, which is waived if it is a hardship. In an adjoining building, the regular summer session is carried out at a cost of up to $575 a course.</p><p>What if the minority youngster, chosen for academic promise and on the recommendation of the guidance counselor, becomes a disciplinary problem or otherwise does not want to be associated with the prep school?</p><p>''In 10 years that was the case with maybe three,'' said Corrine Grandolfo, executive director of the minority program, principal of the middle school and the mother of the science teacher, Christine Grandolfo. ''Our problem is the opposite. The purpose of the program is not intended to lead to enrollment at Rye Country Day School, but some have asked to become students.''</p><p>As she spoke, a shy girl who is one of the minority students and yearns to be a full-time student at the school appeared at her office door. ''She was here earlier,'' Mrs. Grandolfo said. ''She asked me, 'Do you think I might have a chance?' ''</p><p>Later that day, to shouts of ''good luck,'' the girl walked down the hall and into a classroom for admission tests, which might be the first step in fulfilling her own educational dream.</p><p>Photo: Enrolled in the Academic Action Program at Rye Country Day School are Heidi Marroquin, left, and Joia DeBerry.
