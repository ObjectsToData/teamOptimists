Such traditional activities still have their place at Columbus, a magnet school for science, math and technology, but significant change is afoot.         The school is one of several in the county that have found new ways to divide up the academic day. At Columbus, for example, a schedule in effect since September provides second and third graders with 90 minutes of daily language arts instruction instead of the usual 40 minutes and allows children to work in  small groups with their teachers. Leah Rukeyser, the principal, said that by assigning more responsibility to staff members like reading specialists, all students can receive close personal attention.   ">

Leah Rukeyser, the principal, said that by assigning more responsibility to staff members like reading specialists, all students can receive close personal attention.</p><p>Nationwide, education officials say that a more creative use of time is the  missing link in efforts to improve American schools. "The 6-hour, 180-day school year should be relegated to museums, an exhibit from our education past," said a report issued in 1994 by the National Education Commission on time and learning. "The key to liberating learning lies in unlocking time."</p><p>Principals and teachers in the county are studying programs in Delaware, Colorado, New Mexico and elsewhere that lengthened the school day or week, divided the school year into college-like semesters or are being operated with extended blocks of teaching time rather than the traditional shorter sessions. Such changes have accompanied other national trends like grouping students of diverse abilities together, raising the standards for what all students should learn and extending the school's role in the community, especially in inner cities.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The New York State Regents held a recent series of public forums to consider  a list of eight recommendations made by the National Education Commission in the report, titled "Prisoners of Time." The commission suggested, for example, devoting at least five and a half hours each day to core academic subjects, providing ample development time for teachers and reorganizing schools with "learning, not time," as the guiding principle.</p><p>Speaking at a forum at White Plains High School, Dr. Milton Goldberg, executive director of the commission, said that "the BBC -- bells, buses and the calendar" was the sticking point in efforts to change many school systems. At Roosevelt High School in Yonkers, administrators are taking pains to win teacher acceptance of the plan, scheduled to take effect there next fall. The school will adopt a two-semester calendar; each semester, students will take four daily 98-minute classes, two devoted to core subjects like English, math, science or social studies, and two electives. Classroom teachers will be assigned three classes, one planning period and a 42-minute lunch period.</p><p>Dr. Michael Yarzulo, Roosevelt's principal, said he was excited about the plan, which will eliminate time now wasted as students change classes and provide added time for complex activities like science experiments. "It is almost impossible to set up, explain and do an experiment and clean up in 42 minutes." Dr. Yarzulo said. With longer classes, referred to as block scheduling, "science teachers can do experiments in even non-Regents classes."</p><p>He said he could understand teachers' fears about the new schedule, which has been in the planning stage for a year. "They're not sure, given the generation of today that is very demanding as to 'entertain me,' how they are going to hold their attention for 90 minutes," he said. "What happens when you accelerate the  schedule and then kids lose days for a blizzard? How will advanced placement courses be handled? They worry about Regents' exams, and if they will be ever able to cover the curriculum." Teachers are attending workshops to prepare for the change, he said, and he is "sending the most pessimistic ones to other schools where this has been used," elsewhere in New York State, Maryland and Vermont. Dr. Barbara Ann Levine, a social studies teacher at Fox Lane High School in Bedford, said she and an English teacher meet daily with a heterogeneous group of ninth graders in a three-period time block devoted to the humanities. "It is not harder, but it's different," Dr. Levine said. "I love it. Once you've done it, you don't want to go back to any other way."</p><p>The students do not get bored, she said, because they are not simply sitting  in their seats listening to a lecture. "Any good teacher knows that you don't do the same thing for 40 minutes," she said. "The philosophy is you change your activity at least three times. You might do a 10-minute lecture, then lead a cooperative learning exercise or a writing exercise. After a lecture you might put up a political cartoon and ask them to analyze it."</p><p>Students have more time to do concentrated research and edit their work, she  said, and she herself does not feel rushed. "If I'm in the middle of a fabulous  discussion," she said, "I can just send a kid next door and say I don't want to  break now." The English teacher may be working with half the group next door.</p><p>Dr. Levine said students' work had improved and most seem enthusiastic about  the extended class time. One of the most important benefits, she said, is that "I get to know students better intellectually and emotionally." "Today, kids often need extra contact with an adult," she continued, "and this extra time allows that."</p><p>Restructuring the day can also remedy the disruptions caused when students are taken out of classes for remedial instruction. At Jefferson Elementary School in New Rochelle, half the students in a class may leave together for extra help while reading or math teachers work with the remaining students in the classroom. "When the children who are pulled out come back as a group, the teacher works with that half," said Don Kuhn, Jefferson's principal. "They don't miss any instruction in the classroom because they all go at the same time, and  the teacher isn't constantly interrupted."</p><p>At Columbus, five fourth graders who needed more time to finish laboratory work clustered around a video microscope and monitor with Pat Wood, the school's science specialist. The assignment was to identify the undigested bones and other materials found in owl pellets, and students seemed riveted by the tiny teeth, pelvic bones and leg bones -- byproducts of dining on voles, mice and moles -- that were magnified on the monitor. Mrs. Rukeyser said one boy who was  closely immersed in the work "reads below grade level, but science really excites him." "He doesn't want to leave" the laboratory, she continued.</p><p>The principal said "any school, any place, with a lot of careful thinking" could reorganize its schedule to give priority to the learning process. "It doesn't take money to do that," Mrs. Rukeyser said. "We didn't bring in extra staff. Any school, by working with existing staff and being creative, can work out flexible scheduling that meets the needs of all children."</p><p>Photos: Lab at Columbus Elementary School, where a science specialistand student spend extra time when needed.
