My mother and cousins worry about her health -- her hypertension, loss of hearing, dizzy spells (one tumble broke her wrist), a minor stroke, chronic fatigue, periodic insomnia, polyuria. I worry about her  soul, her state of being.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"It's no good," she once told a friend. "I'm living too long already. What's  the point?"</p><p>In fact, these days the old are living so long that they have created nothing less than a new stage of life. Since 1900, the life expectancy of the average American has increased from 47 years to 74 years. At the end of World War II, only 8 percent of the population was over 65. Today that number is nearly 13 percent; by 2050 it is likely to be 20 percent: an estimated 100 million elderly men and women.</p><p>We can thank -- "blame," Aunt Millie would surely say -- science for this. In a thoughtful book called "The Journey of Life: A Cultural History of Aging in America," a historian named Thomas R. Cole says that in the last 200 years the social and biomedical sciences have thought of old age as only "an engineering problem to be solved or at least ameliorated." But by reducing old age to a "problem," science has impoverished it, Cole says.</p><p>Science has robbed old age of the rich symbolism and purpose it had for most  of our history. In other words, old age no longer stands for anything. It is empty, purpose-less, without meaning. And as "spiritual animals, we need meaning," Cole says, no less than we need sustenance and health.</p><p>At the moment, more than 31 million Americans are over 65. So many people are living so long that retirement is no longer just a transient afterpiece, the brief interregnum before death. The species has achieved something new, a second summer, if you will.</p><p>Actually it is better to think of this time as a season with two cycles, one  early and one late, each with its own crisis of meaning.</p><p>The first cycle represents the time from 65 to 85 -- from retirement to the onset of physical decline. In the early part of the century, people lived perhaps 2 to 10 years in retirement. Now for 20 years and more. In some ways, this cycle of old age is no different from the rest of life. From birth to retirement, our lives are shaped by institutions -- family, school, work, church, government, culture -- and these same institutions have dictated behavior in the first part of old age.</p><p>In the years after she retired, for example, Aunt Millie followed the pattern of labor, leisure, travel and volunteer work that dominated most of her adult life. In her 70's, she went to camp in the Berkshires, worked with young children and the blind, did some part-time bookkeeping, spent the winters in Florida and filled her evenings with movies, concerts and plays. In other words, she kept busy, which seems to be our society's answer to questions of meaning and existence.</p><p>Meanwhile, the years passed and now she is truly old, too infirm to shuffle off to Miami Beach or to read to second graders or to take in a light opera the first Tuesday of every month. The life of the "oldest old," as those over 85 are known, is marked by what gerontologists call the "dreadful D's" -- decline,  deterioration, dependency, death. From second summer to chill winter.</p><p>"Helen and I and Tillie were sitting outside on the benches the other day talking about getting old and having pains," Aunt Millie said. "I worry about my friends. They're all suffering. Tillie can't see so good and has a double hernia. Helen needs a new hip and lives on Nuprin and Advil. What's the point? I ask you again, what's the point?"</p><p>Cole asks the same question. To him, "meaning" is a metaphor to expose the emptiness of our public discourse on old age -- the pointless debates about "intergenerational conflict" and the hoary political wrangling over Social Security and Medicare. There is something much more important taking place, he seems to be saying, something society has never seen.</p><p>When public-policy experts, bioethicists and fiscal planners talk about the mushrooming numbers of elderly, their voices fill with alarm. They worry aloud about resources and means, expenditures and limits. But all this worrying dodges Aunt Millie's question.</p><p>In effect, we have herded the oldest old, like Aunt Millie, to the margins of society because they do not fit the posture of self-reliance, autonomy and independence we have embraced as a society. Even the advocates for the aged -- government agencies with their lists of services, huge national organizations with their anti-ageism campaigns, community-based meal trucks and social workers and smiling home health aides -- all preach the virtues of independence.</p>                </div>
