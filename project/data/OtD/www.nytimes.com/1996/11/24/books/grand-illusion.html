Maybe you recall that when the Pioneer spacecraft was launched in 1972 it carried with it a pictograph, widely reproduced at the time. In the unlikely event that beings from outer space intercepted the craft, the pictograph was supposed to tell them what human beings look like and where Earth is in our solar system. Line drawings described a man and a woman. The sun and its nine planets were a row of circles; an arrow from the fourth circle, Earth, pointed to a drawing of Pioneer. This represented the craft's trajectory.  ">

                    <p>Illustrated. 624 pp. San Francisco:</p><p>Phaidon Press/Chronicle Books. $49.95.</p><p>Maybe you recall that when the Pioneer spacecraft was launched in 1972 it carried with it a pictograph, widely reproduced at the time. In the unlikely event that beings from outer space intercepted the craft, the pictograph was supposed to tell them what human beings look like and where Earth is in our solar system. Line drawings described a man and a woman. The sun and its nine planets were a row of circles; an arrow from the fourth circle, Earth, pointed to a drawing of Pioneer. This represented the craft's trajectory.</p><p>The pictograph was meant to be, quite literally, universal. But what could a directional line mean to creatures who hadn't invented bows and arrows? And if, somehow, they were to grasp that the drawings depicted humans, without a knowledge of foreshortening how could they know that the woman's body was slightly turned, obscuring a hand? They would assume that Earth women have a claw.</p><p>The pictograph is one of E. H. Gombrich's most familiar examples of what he has been telling us for years about illusion in art, which is that it is not as simple as it may look. It derives from a system of conventions evolved over centuries of trial and error, a process he has famously called ''making and matching.'' Illusion is achieved when, as Gombrich puts it, there is a correspondence between our reaction to an image and the reality of what it represents -- which is not the same as saying that the image mirrors reality. We have come instinctively to accept in a painted seascape, say, that stacked white lines of diminishing size denote waves receding into the distance. So we disregard the literal interpretation that the waves rise one above the other into the air. In fact, we've got so accustomed to seeing this way that it's difficult to see what is literally there.</p><p>At 87, Sir Ernst Gombrich may be the best-known art historian of all time, thanks to ''The Story of Art,'' which he reluctantly began to write in the 1930's as a history of art for children but then turned into a basic and hugely popular text for adults. Its 16th edition, revised and expanded, has recently appeared as a copiously illustrated paperback. Gombrich's enormous reputation otherwise rests on writings like ''Art and Illusion'' and ''Meditations on a Hobby Horse,'' and on a number of groundbreaking essays on Renaissance art. If you don't know them, or him, you can find out a great deal from ''The Essential Gombrich,'' which brings together key excerpts from classics like ''Art and Illusion'' and also from less familiar sources, so that even people familiar with Gombrich will most likely find something fresh.</p><p>Recently the physicist Steven Weinberg pointed out in The New York Review of Books that it never was true that only a dozen people could understand Einstein's papers on general relativity. ''But if it had been true,'' he added, ''it would have been a failure of Einstein's, not a mark of his brilliance.'' It's no coincidence that two of the most important art historians of the last 50 years, Gombrich and Meyer Schapiro, are notable not just for their brilliance but for being among the most lucid and straightforward writers in the field. True, Gombrich sometimes leaves an impression that he's straining to sound like the rest of us. And while he can make you want to head for the library to read more philosophy, he doesn't necessarily make you want to run to a museum, the way Schapiro does. Gombrich's clarity, his Johnsonian abhorrence of cant, comes at the cost of a certain attention to the esthetic side of art. He is better, in a sense, at pictographs than paintings, perhaps because, unlike Schapiro, he is an intellectual who practices art history rather than an art historian who is also an intellectual.</p><p>That said, ''The Essential Gombrich'' makes clear his panoramic erudition, spanning psychology, iconology, historiography and the study of gestures, ornaments and caricatures. It includes autobiographical reflections, and reflections on Raphael and Poussin, Giulio Romano and Leonardo, Schubert and Saul Steinberg. Reading him, you can get the slightly dizzying sense of someone who has ransacked everything, including, in one case, a behavioral study of white ants, to bolster his arguments.</p><p>At their core is his belief that works of art ''are not the results of some mysterious activity, but objects made by human beings for human beings,'' a thought that in one form or another weaves through his writing. Like the pictograph, this idea may seem obvious but is not, because to say that objects are made by humans is to imply that they are not the products of amorphous epochs: there is nothing more dubious to Gombrich than what William Hazlitt in the 19th century called the Spirit of the Age. It is absurd, he says, to account for Botticelli's women by asserting that Renaissance Florence was virginal and springlike. Visual forms are solutions to specific problems that come from specific historical situations. The forms catch on with a group of people and evolve piecemeal; great artists are separated from the others not as inventors but as discoverers of appropriate forms. Only retrospectively does this piecemeal evolution seem to have had a clear destination.</p>                </div>
