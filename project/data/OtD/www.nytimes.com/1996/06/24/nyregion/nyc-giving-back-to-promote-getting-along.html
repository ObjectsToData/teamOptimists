                    <p>KELVIN CHRISTOPHER JAMES traces "the James thing," as he calls it, to a family ritual in Arima, the village in Trinidad where he grew up. On the first Sunday of the year, his mother would organize a feast for everyone in that rural outpost. For her son, it meant a full day of "working like a slave," but he learned an important lesson from his labors.</p><p>"The purpose of family is to give," he said, "and I take that admonition seriously."</p><p>Segue to Harlem, where Mr. James now lives, a 48-year-old writer with two published novels and a collection of short stories under his belt. In his time,  he received his share of scholarships and government grants, and when he began a few years ago to enjoy a measure of literary success, he decided the moment had  come to give as well as to receive.</p><p>Feeding this village of New York was obviously out of the question. So he transformed "the James thing" into something else entirely. For each of the last four years, he has set aside a few thousand dollars, distributing the money in late spring as prizes to high school students judged by him to have produced the best writing on his assigned theme: "How to get along together in New York."</p>                </div>

                    <p>MAKE no mistake. There is no small measure of ego in this endeavor. "I like bragging about myself," Mr. James acknowledged, his voice rising and falling in  the cadences of the Caribbean, like the pages of his latest novel, "A Fling With a Demon Lover" (Harper Collins). Just the same, he said, writers have certain obligations.</p><p>He wondered aloud about the creeps out there, authors getting $6 million contracts. "What do they do for their communities?" (Truth in packaging: he used a word many times stronger than "creeps," but it is not about to be printed here.) "The John Grishams of the world, what do they give back?" he said. "What  do they do with all that money?"</p><p>"You must make an example of generosity," he said, "so that people can see that generosity is acceptable and even possible."</p><p>In New York, these have not been good times for the generous. Evelyn Alvarez  was generous. She handed out lollipops to children and kindnesses to adults at her dry-cleaning store on Park Avenue. What did it get her? Beaten to death as she opened the shop two weeks ago. All month, the local news has been dominated  by acts of viciousness, and while there have been several spectacular arrests, the victims are piling up from Westhampton, L.I., to Central Park.</p><p>How to get along together in New York, indeed.</p><p>The other day, Mr. James went to the High School for the Humanities, on West  18th Street, to hand checks of $700 each to three young women, his 1996 winners. He had wrestled with the idea of giving somewhat larger awards, as he had in the past. But for some reason, the number of entrants was smaller than usual, and so he decided the prize money should be, too.</p><p>For sure, no one was about to walk away rich, but then that was never the idea. "It is to try to touch the lives of these young people, who have stories that may come out of them through this money," Mr. James said.</p><p>GATHERED for the brief ceremony in the school library, decorated with yellow  balloons, the students didn't seem to care much about dollar amounts. They were  just happy to be winners: Najah Batts, 19, Joy Chen, 16, and Elaine Wan, 16, all of whom said the money was going right into the bank.</p><p>She loves writing, said Miss Chen, a junior at the New York City Lab School,  and it was useful to have her parents see it is possible to make money at it. "They were surprised," she said. "They think writers are very poor and they starve." Miss Batts, who is graduating from the High School for the Humanities and is about to join the Army, said, "You can spend your life just keeping your  eyes straight, or you can look around you, take it in and write about it." As for Miss Wan, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she confided that she was "more prone to become a scientist than a writer."</p><p>By now, you may be wondering what the point of all this is. Nothing, really.  These students' poems and essays were of a generalized nature and not intended to be how-to manuals for coping in a city where it is often impossible to get people to do simple things like moving to the back of the bus.</p><p>But it has been a surly, overheated June, and it was nice to see even a small affirmation that the city's school system, for all the naysaying one usually hears, does in fact produce some young people who can put subject and predicate  together in admirable fashion.</p><p>Besides, Mr. James said, his dreadlocks bobbing, he is convinced after 20 years here that "people really do get along."</p><p>"You're forced to practice tolerance in New York," he said. "All these people who don't always like each other are thrown together -- on the street, in the subway. You have to learn to take it. Getting along is demanding. It demands thought. It demands action."</p>                </div>
