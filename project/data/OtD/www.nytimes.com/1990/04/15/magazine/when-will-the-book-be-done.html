                    <p>I'M ALWAYS MAKING SUGGESTIONS to my husband that I later regret. On Friday afternoon, June 16, 1972, I telephoned Neil at the Washington bureau of The New York Times to ask him about the funeral he had attended at Arlington National Cemetery that morning. A week earlier, a good friend and influential source from his years as a correspondent in Vietnam, John Paul Vann, had been killed in a helicopter crash there. I listened for half an hour while Neil described the funeral in captivating detail and spoke emotionally about Vann, the civilian-soldier whose death had caught him by surprise, because Vann had spent 10 years in Vietnam beating the odds that claimed the lives of other, more cautious men. ''It sounds as if there's a book in Vann,'' I said, before we hung up.</p><p>Vietnam was the story Neil could never quite get away from. United Press International had sent him there first in 1962 for two years, and then The Times had sent him back in 1965 for a third year. After being assigned to Washington in the fall of 1966, he had covered the Defense Department, which meant covering the Washington end of the war, and in 1971 had obtained the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the conflict. In February 1972, Neil had published his first book, ''The Arnheiter Affair,'' about a bizarre naval drama that had occurred aboard the U.S.S. Vance, a destroyer escort on coastal patrol off South Vietnam. He had considered writing a memoir of the war for the past year, and had drafted a proposal. He had even given it a title, ''An End to Innocence.''</p><p>That night over dinner we talked about the funeral. Neil had been thinking about John Vann all day. Vann was a metaphorical figure through whom he could tell the story of the war in Vietnam. Within two months Neil had secured a two-year leave of absence from the paper and a contract from Random House for a 100,000-word biography of John Vann. He had flown off to Denver on June 29 to interview Vann's former wife, Mary Jane, and other members of the Vann family. By August, Neil was in Vietnam for three months to interview Vann's Vietnamese and American friends and associates who had fought his last battles with him. The manuscript was to be delivered in the summer of 1974.</p><p>I had ample time to regret my suggestion. ''A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,'' all 360,000 words of it, was published in October 1988. By then, more than 16 years had elapsed since our fateful conversation.</p>                </div>

                    <p>LIFE SEEMED PROMISING IN THE summer of 1972. We were both 35. We lived with our daughters Maria, 5, and Catherine, 3, and a baby sitter in a house we'd bought in 1966 with a $35,000, 6 percent mortgage and considered ourselves well off. We had used Neil's $10,000 advance for ''The Arnheiter Affair'' as a down payment on a farm in West Virginia, and in 1973 started to build a log cabin in an apple orchard on our mountainous acres. It had taken Neil only three years to write ''The Arnheiter Affair,'' while holding a job; neither the anticipated time or word length of the Vann book seemed forbidding.</p><p>Nineteen-seventy-four was the worst year of our lives. Marcus Aurelius Arnheiter, the ex-captain of the U.S.S. Vance, had sued Neil, Random House and others for libel shortly after the book's publication. A suit had been expected, because Arnheiter had a record of suing and losing, but Neil, Random House and the publisher's lawyers could not have imagined the costs in money and misery of several libel suits that Arnheiter proceeded to file on this occasion. In late 1973, one of the lawyers directed Neil to write a memo cataloguing his entire research files. Neil spent most of 1974 writing a 343-page memorandum and organizing a 14-foot-high stack of book-research materials for the lawyers.</p><p>We had always been (Continued on Page 68) night owls. Neil's workday at The Times was from 11 A.M. to 8 P.M.; we usually went to bed at 2 A.M. After the memo writing began, Neil's bedtime advanced to 3 or 4 A.M. and gradually to 6 A.M. During the summer of 1974, Neil would stop at 6, have a hot bath and do exercises for a back problem, take 10 milligrams of Valium the doctor who was treating him for his back had prescribed, and try to go to sleep. The all-night memo writing would help win the Arnheiter lawsuits, but it was squandering the time and money that was supposed to be spent on the book. Wild with rage and frustration, Neil would take another five milligrams of Valium. Usually he fell asleep but sometimes he was so angry that after tossing and turning for hours he would get out of bed, mow the lawn or work in the garden to sweat out his rage in the sun, and go back to writing the memo. By the next morning, he would be able to sleep.</p><p>Neil finished the memo in November 1974. The cabin was virtually completed and he decided to go to West Virginia for a few days to relax before returning to the Vann book. He left for the farm in our car on Nov. 24. On the 25th, it snowed. As he was driving to a friend's office in nearby western Maryland to borrow a four-wheel-drive vehicle, a young man who liked to drive down the wrong side of the road drove his unregistered station wagon head-on into the car, breaking 10 of Neil's bones. In 1975, Neil was too weak to do much work. The book's original due date passed and he hadn't yet written a line.</p>                </div>
