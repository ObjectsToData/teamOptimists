                    <p>Louisiana State University Press. $29.95.</p><p>In ''Race and History,'' a collection of some two dozen essays spanning the half-century of his career, the eminent historian John Hope Franklin has provided both a meditation on history and the record of an extraordinary life. For Mr. Franklin, as both a black man and a historian, the past and the present have been inextricably intertwined. Since the time of their unwilling arrival on American shores, African-Americans have seen the tools of history used as powerful weapons of their oppression, and historians' understanding of the past has continued to shape the experience of blacks in our own time.</p><p>But, as Mr. Franklin's life and a number of the essays here attest, the emergence of African-American history in the second half of the 20th century has transformed the study of the past into a force for liberation. It has served, Mr. Franklin contends, as an ''important factor in the civil rights struggle'' and has worked to ''rehabilitate a whole people,'' to ''force America to keep faith with herself'' and to ''remind her that truth is more praiseworthy than power.''</p><p>Mr. Franklin spent his childhood, as he recounts in what is perhaps the volume's most arresting piece, in an all-black Oklahoma town. His father, a lawyer, had been expelled from a courtroom because of his race and had retreated to the small town after resolving to ''resign from the world dominated by white people.'' Though he grew up without electricity or running water, Mr. Franklin did not grow up without books. His mother, an elementary school teacher, introduced him to the world of letters at an early age; his long evenings of reading by the light of a kerosene lamp, he was told, led to his need for glasses when he was 5 years old.</p><p>Early on, Mr. Franklin encountered racial hostility directly, when he and his mother were ejected from a train for sitting in a white coach. At Fisk College in Nashville, he experienced a still more threatening reminder of the South's system of racial oppression when a fellow student was abducted and lynched by a white mob. After the University of Oklahoma refused to accept a black for graduate study, Mr. Franklin settled for Harvard. Yet even a Harvard Ph.D. did not protect the young scholar from the omnipresent realities of American racism. While doing research, Mr. Franklin was assigned segregated seating in archives and manuscript libraries, and barred from restaurants near the Library of Congress well into the 1950's. Yet, he insists, ''for a Negro scholar searching for truth, the search for food in the city of Washington was one of the minor inconveniences.''</p><p>A more profound dilemma, in Mr. Franklin's view, has been negotiating the treacherous shoals ''between hard-hitting advocacy on the one hand and the highest standards of scholarship on the other.'' He has been actively involved in the civil rights struggles of the last generation, from his role as a researcher for the N.A.A.C.P. in the epochal Brown v. Board of Education case to his more recent Congressional testimony opposing the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court. Yet he insists on the importance of maintaining the boundary between advocacy and scholarship. Historical work, with its established standards for evaluation of evidence, must not be ''polluted by passion''; we must not simply turn the past into a mirror of our own present-day concerns.</p><p>Some of the most effective essays in the book illustrate how such abuses of history served to maintain systems of slavery, segregation and injustice in the past - how the antebellum South rewrote the history of the American Revolution to justify its increasing commitment to slavery, or how the popular history represented by D. W. Griffith's 1915 film ''The Birth of a Nation'' worked to legitimize the early 20th-century revival of the Ku Klux Klan. But Mr. Franklin offers his critiques not just to discredit these faulty interpretations or simply to illustrate appropriate standards of historical inquiry. The substance of these two essays, and of others in the collection, serves as a warning that only insistence upon impartial rules of research and evidence can insure protection against the use of history as an arbitrary weapon of advocacy by those whose political goals we deplore.</p><p>Mr. Franklin has not found it easy to maintain his dual identity as a black and as a historian. ''The world of the Negro scholar is indescribably lonely; and he must, somehow, pursue truth down that lonely path while, at the same time, making certain that his conclusions are sanctioned by universal standards developed and maintained by those who frequently do not even recognize him,'' he writes. This negotiation has often forced Mr. Franklin, he says, into a ''repression of . . . feelings'' that ''would not be satisfying to some, and . . . may even be lacking in courage. I do not commend it; I merely confess it.'' Angered by the hatred and discrimination he has witnessed, yet determined to keep that anger out of his scholarship, Mr. Franklin has at times turned in frustration to ''blowing off steam in literary efforts.'' He mentions two pieces that he wrote in response to humiliating experiences of prejudice, but, true to his code, he does not include them here.</p><p>In an era when many scholars in the humanities and social sciences are questioning whether it is possible to identify any foundations for truth or scholarly objectivity, John Hope Franklin offers a compelling case for continuing to struggle toward these goals. Both his life and his work represent a commitment to learning as an important way to ''bear witness'' in a society that he, perhaps better than any American scholar alive today, knows to be far from perfect. His faith and his achievement cannot but serve as witness and inspiration to all of us privileged to be engaged with him in the historical enterprise.</p><p>THAT'S HISTORY, NOT BLACK HISTORY</p><p>John Hope Franklin must feel very comfortable in his scholar's robes: the 75-year-old recipient of over 80 honorary degrees was tracked down by phone on the eve of delivering another commencement address - this one about the importance of community participation - to the graduating class of Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p><p>''Compiling the essays in 'Race and History' gave me a chance to look at my career as a whole,'' said Mr. Franklin, who is the emeritus James B. Duke Professor of History and a professor of legal history at Duke University. ''As a historian I'm always looking back, but this project asked me to look back in an entirely new way. I had over a hundred of my pieces to choose from, but only a quarter or so of those could be included in the book. I had to ask myself what it is exactly that I've been trying to get at all these years, and then decide which of my essays most embodied that. In this sense, the collection is almost autobiographical.''</p><p>Asked what role his race has played in determining his specialties as a historian, he said, ''It's often assumed I'm a scholar of Afro-American history, but the fact is I haven't taught a course in Afro-American history in 30-some-odd years. They say I'm the author of 12 books on black history, when several of those books focus mainly on whites. I'm called a leading black historian, never minding the fact that I've served as president of the American Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, the Southern Historical Association, Phi Beta Kappa, and on and on.''</p><p>''The tragedy,'' he said, ''is that black scholars so often have their specialties forced on them. My specialty is the history of the South, and that means I teach the history of blacks and whites.''</p><p>MARK MCGURL</p><p>Photo: John Hope Franklin during the Alabama civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965</p>                </div>
