                    <p>Four years after it was replaced by a new edition that claimed to be an improvement over the classic text of ''Ulysses,'' James Joyce's celebrated novel, the earlier version is being reissued by Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House.</p><p>The republishing of the previous text on Saturday means that book buyers will be able to choose between the classic edition and a ''corrected text'' that Vintage issued in 1986 in response to charges that the earlier version had thousands of errors and omissions.</p><p>''It will be interesting to see which edition the scholars and the public will come to favor,'' said Martin Asher, the editor in chief of Vintage.</p><p>Over the years scholars have found many minor punctuation errors and misspellings in the original version of ''Ulysses,'' which was published in the United States in 1934 by Random House, seven years before Joyce died. Many of the errors were corrected in the edition Random House published in 1961. But it was difficult for one scholar to compare Joyce's many drafts and revisions, which were scattered in libraries and private collections.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A Job for a Team</p><p>In the late 1970's, a team of scholars under the leadership of Hans Walter Gabler, a professor of English at the University of Munich in West Germany, collated Joyce's original typescript with the many proofs. In 1984 they produced a new edition of ''Ulysses'' that they said corrected almost 5,000 omissions, transpositions and other errors in the classic text.</p><p>The corrected edition was published in three volumes in 1984 by the Garland Publishing Company of New York, which specializes in photographic reprints of antiquarian books and manuscripts. It was also published in one volume by Vintage in 1986.</p><p>Prof. John Kidd, the director of Boston University's James Joyce Research Center and the leading critic of the corrected edition, said that the decision to republish the classic text vindicated his assertions that the revised work was more problematic than the classic one.</p><p>Some of the criticisms first raised by Professor Kidd did in fact cause some scholars to question the corrected text. Professor Kidd said the Gabler research team overlooked several typesettings of the book and relied on facsimiles of manuscripts rather than originals.</p><p>'The Right Thing to Do'</p><p>''The classic 'Ulysses' does not have the thousands of errors attributed to it by Gabler,'' Professor Kidd asserted in a recent telephone conversation, ''and his own publisher has conceded this.''</p><p>Professor Gabler has repeatedly defended his scholarship and denied Professor Kidd's charges. Moreover, neither of Professor Gabler's American publishers is prepared to proclaim Professor Kidd the winner of the dispute.</p><p>''It seemed to us that as the original American publisher of 'Ulysses,' the right thing to do in a controversy like this is to have both versions available, so that those who are textually knowledgeable can compare them,'' Mr. Asher, of Vintage, said.  Gavin Gail Borden, the president of Garland, said his publishing house intended to keep its three-volume edition of Professor Gabler's text in print. He added, however, ''There are probably a number of corrections that should be made, and we'll stick them in when the next printing rolls around.''</p><p>Asked if any of those corrections are those cited by Professor Kidd, Mr. Borden replied: ''I would assume some of them are, but I'm just guessing. Since I'm not a textual scholar, I don't know the details.''</p><p>Parallels in Literature</p><p>G. Thomas Tanselle, a textual critic and a past president of the Bibliographical Society of America, said that Professor Kidd ''has called into question not only the accuracy of the Gabler edition but the scholarly research that underlies it.'' Nevertheless, he added, it is not unusual to have more than one edition of a classic work in print. ''There are a number of different editions of individual Shakespeare plays,'' he said. ''And there are lots of editions of 'Moby-Dick' available.''</p><p>Scholars say some of the textual difficulties with ''Ulysses'' stem from the literary styles and techniques that helped make it a masterpiece, including unpunctuated passages of more than 40 pages. But there are other difficulties. After several typists refused to type episodes of the novel that they considered bawdy, Joyce's friends undertook the task on borrowed typewriters. In the process, they not only added their own punctuation, they also misspelled some words and corrected the spelling of others that the author intended to be misspelled.</p><p>Moreover, type for the book was set by hand in Dijon, 160 miles southeast of Paris, by 26 French printers who did not know English and worked from a single-spaced manuscript. In addition, Joyce added 100,000 words to the page proofs.</p><p>The First Edition</p><p>Eventually ''Ulysses,'' which follows Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom through the streets of Dublin on June 16, 1904, on journeys that are marked by deliberate parallels to Homer's ''Odyssey,'' was published in Paris in English in 1922 by Shakespeare &amp; Company, a bookstore owned by the literary patron Sylvia Beach.</p><p>It has long been considered one of the most error-ridden of major literary works. It was also among the most controversial works of its day. While tame by today's standards, ''Ulysses'' was barred from the United States as obscene until 1933, when Bennett Cerf, a co-founder of Random House, invited a court test. That December, John M. Woolsey, a Federal judge, lifted the ban on the book, and a few months later Random House published it.</p><p>In 1961, the 1934 edition was corrected and re-set, and it is this version of the novel that was regarded as official until the Gabler edition was published in 1986.</p><p>Judging the Differences</p><p>Dr. Thomas F. Staley, a Joyce scholar and the director of the Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, said the differences between the editions published in 1961 and the Gabler edition are significant but not major. ''You don't have two different books,'' he said. ''You have slightly different versions of the same book, although there are serious questions about some passages.''</p><p>''Textual critics are not just automatons,'' Dr. Staley said. ''They have to make decisions. But they also have to have some kind of authority, and in Gabler's case that authority is frequently debatable.''</p><p>Moreover, Dr. Staley said, Random House could have avoided the implication that it is republishing ''a corrupt text'' if the publisher had said in 1961 what changes it was making in the 1934 edition. ''Were there 50 corrections?'' he asked. ''Or 500 corrections? Or 1,500?''</p><p>Nevertheless, Dr. Staley used the Gabler edition while teaching a graduate seminar in ''Ulysses'' last spring and said he would probably use it again. ''But of course, when I do,'' he said, ''I'll make the students aware of some of the problems with it.''</p>                </div>
