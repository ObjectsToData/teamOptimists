                    <p>"Forget about it," he said. A Widely Praised Move</p><p>Despite such backhanded endorsements, Brooklyn College's adoption a decade ago of a rigidly constructed core curriculum for all 12,000 undergraduates, regardless of their major, has been widely praised and often imitated.</p><p>Since 1980 more than 200 college administrators have come to Brooklyn's 26-acre campus in Flatbush to learn how a large public institution -- part of the City University of New York, with a 44 percent minority enrollment -- had been able to take such a move and not only survive, but thrive.</p><p>Lynn V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, calls Brooklyn's requirements "probably one of the most famous cores in the country."</p><p>Brooklyn's stability stands in contrast to the intellectual ferment at many other institutions, where the core curriculum has become a battleground between traditionalists and those who demand increased cultural diversity. Stanford, Harvard and many other campuses have been split by debates over whether students should study the "great books" of Western civilization or be exposed to works from African, Asian, Hispanic and other cultures. Contemporary and Traditional</p><p>For the last 10 years Brooklyn's core curriculum has included both contemporary and traditional studies to a degree that may be unique in this country. Still, the college believes in tinkering with success.</p><p>"With experience you learn that even good things can be improved upon," said Robert L. Hess, the president of Brooklyn College, who, with the colege's former provost, Ethyle R. Wolfe, helped set up the curriculum a decade ago.</p><p>Guardians of academic tradition need not fear for Brooklyn's future; no one is advocating courses on "MTV Culture" or "The Media and the Mind." Rather, what is sought now is more accessibility, the 1990's version of relevance.</p><p>The focus of change now is the Western civilization requirement, with its heavy reliance on classic literature. Responding to criticism from some students, the classics department at Brooklyn, which offers about 20 sessions of the course each semester, is seeking ways to bring broader interpretation to the works of antiquity so that they touch on contemporary issues. Alternative Syllabus Planned</p><p>"We're trying to give more thematic focus to what was going on in the past," said Frederick Winter, an associate professor of classics at Brooklyn who has been given a semester to design an alternative syllabus for the course.</p><p>Most colleges have a core curriculum but it usually is far more general than Brooklyn's, requiring students to pick from a wide variety of courses to fulfill requirements in areas like history or science.</p><p>Brooklyn is one of just a few colleges or universities in the nation, including Columbia, the University of Chicago and St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., that have core curriculums for all undergraduates. The 10 courses at Brooklyn make up one-fourth of a student's academic experience and are envisioned by faculty members as a basic skills package that prepares students for a well-rounded life.</p><p>Besides the classics, the traditional core includes art, music, literature, chemistry, biology, mathematics and philosophy. The Brooklyn curriculum also includes such bows to modern times as computer programming, colonialism and studies in African, Asian and Latin American cultures. A Woman's Perspective</p><p>Professors who teach the classics course, known as "Core One," continually try to connect the material to the modern world, but sometimes that can be difficult. For example, since nearly all the classic works were written by men, bringing in a woman's perspective is challenging.</p><p>Mr. Winter said one change now under consideration is switching from Homer's "Iliad," with its male-oriented focus on war, to "The Odyssey," in which the hero's struggle to return home deals more completely with the concept of community and the role of women.</p><p>But there is a limit to the bounds of literature, especially as it deals with women, so Mr. Winter said there could be experiments with different sources, like ancient funeral statues and plaques that portray women as independent members of society, not just as mothers.</p><p>To help the faculty consider various changes, the classics department held a symposium in November with experts from around the country.</p><p>"What came out of it was not a suggestion to throw out what we have," said Professor Hanson, the department chairman, "but to take a new look at it." Other Curriculum Changes</p><p>There have been changes in other parts of the core curriculum. In one of the earliest changes, the math and computer science course was substantially revised after the first two years because about half the students taking it were getting D's or F's. Part of the problem was the way the course was taught; students were able to use computers in a laboratory but not in the classroom. Also, the mathematics part of the class was found to rely too heavily on abstract concepts for an introductory course.</p><p>The college installed desk top computers and, while keeping the original course, offered an alternative that would be easier for liberal arts majors to understand.</p><p>The college still has comparatively high failure rates for the core courses in math and the classics, but a remedial program helps many students when they retake the course so they can graduate. Enrollment has increased since 1980, and Mr. Hess says even the demeanor of students has changed.</p><p>"In the quadrangle when I first got here in 1979, you used to see Frisbee players and touch football," he said. "Now, if you come on a warm day you see students all sitting around studying."</p><p>Photo: The rigidly constructed core curriculum at Brooklyn College, adopted a decade ago, has not only survived, but has thrived.
