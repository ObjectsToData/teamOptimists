Each poured out her grievances but eventually acknowledged, under questioning from the student mediator, that she did not really want an after-school showdown. Instead, the two agreed that they would tell their friends the dispute had been settled and that, in the future, they would ignore each other. "Better Than Fighting"</p><p>"This was not a perfect case," said the 15-year-old mediator, Hazel Bowe, "but still it was better than fighting."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Ms. Bowe was trained in listening and conciliation by a group called Effective Alternatives in Reconciliation Services, or EARS. Privately-financed, it is one of a growing number of such organizations whose services are being introduced in thousands of schools.</p><p>The phenomenon of school-based mediation has spread in a short time throughout the nation, including Hawaii and Alaska. Some programs, like EARS, focus on mediation by peers. Others concentrate on teaching peacemaking in general as part of the school curriculum. Still others combine both methods.</p><p>Young mediators learn to deal with interracial incidents, gang fights, property theft and disputes touched off by gossip, taunts, threats or, as in the Bronx school, even by a look perceived as hostile.</p><p>They are trained to begin by seeking a pledge that students will not resort to name-calling or interrupt, and to phrase questions in such a way as to assure the parties that they are getting a nonjudgmental hearing. This often leads to a settlement, and sometimes to a signed agreement. The Fourth R</p><p>School-based resolution of disputes is being promoted as "the fourth R" by some education leaders, teachers and community groups. Indeed, the National Association for Mediation in Education, which represents hundreds of organizations and individuals, chose The Fourth R as the name of its monthly newsletter, published at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.</p><p>The growth of school-based mediation is widely seen as a response to an alarming growth of violence among the young. Homicide nationwide has become the second major cause of death, after accidents, among young people 15 to 24, and the leading cause in New York City. Last Thursday in the Bronx, a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed after a confrontation between junior high school students that began with a staring match that escalated until one student fired a gun.</p><p>But Ray Schoenholtz, a California trial lawyer who was an early developer of programs to settle conflicts, objects to a narrow, crime-prevention perspective alone. The Community Board in San Francisco, which he founded in 1976, was one of the first mediation projects and remains a national leader in training others.</p><p>"Schools should be concerned with conflict management because it is an essential skill for a democratic society." A Variety of Programs</p><p>San Francisco and New York are widely regarded as being the vanguard of the school-mediation movement, which evolved in the early 1960's, drawing inspiration from the peace movement, Quaker concepts and labor union experiences. But it has been adopted elsewhere, often in ingenious ways, like these:</p><p>In New Mexico, a state-financed program for 30,000 students operates in more than 100 elementary and secondary schools, many in remote areas like Indian reservations and small Hispanic communities where the teen-age mediators are trained in Spanish. Staff trainers have also introduced conflict mediation to correctional institutions for young people.</p><p>In Ann Arbor, Mich., where a conflict management curriculum was introduced three years ago, all the city's 14,232 students from 5 to 18 years old are now reached. Training is also offered to parents and all school staff members, including bus drivers and cafeteria managers.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, students who complete training at Schenley High School, the city's first to use teen-age mediators, are awarded diplomas by Judge Lawrence W. Kaplan in a courtroom ceremony, during which the teen-agers take an oath swearing to be fair and impartial mediators and to maintain confidentiality. Accredited mediators serve in school and are also called upon to help resolve disputes in the community.</p><p>Today scores of seminars are held each year for teachers, handbooks are churned out, and streams of observers come from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and South America to visit American mediation classes. Some Pose as Experts</p><p>The steamrolling demand worries some educators, who say it is outrunning the pool of trained instructors. Some report that unqualified individuals are posing as experts, attracted to the field because it masters government and philanthropic financing.</p>                </div>
