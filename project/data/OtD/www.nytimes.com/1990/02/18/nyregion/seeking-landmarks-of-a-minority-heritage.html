But most places around the state that reflect the history of women and minorities are not recognized, and the Connecticut Historical Commission intends to change that.</p><p>The commission wants to identify and document buildings, sites and districts that are relevant to the history of women, blacks, Indians and Americans of Asian and Latin American descent. ''We have so few of those sites identified,'' said Cora Murray, a researcher for the commission.</p><p>She added that the commission is seeking help in its mission. ''We really feel the need to solicit ideas from the general public and from knowledgeable experts,'' Ms. Murray said.</p><p>Hill-Stead and Crandall House</p>                </div>

                    <p>She cited some - but few - examples of recognized sites. She noted that Theodate Pope Riddle, daughter of the industrialist Alfred Pope, is credited with helping (in 1900) to design her father's house, now the Hill-Stead Museum, in Farmington, and that the Prudence Crandall House in Canterbury, where Mrs. Crandall ran the first academy in New England for ''young ladies and misses of color,'' is also a museum.</p><p>She also cited the Mashantucket Pequots' efforts to study and preserve sites connected with the tribe's history, the work of the New Haven Preservation Trust to identify city buildings and neighborhoods reflecting black history, and a coming exhibit in Hamden that will focus on Alice Washburn, who designed and built more than 80 houses in Connecticut, mostly in the 1920's. But the commission - which can provide some grants - wants to find more examples and to encourage other efforts.</p><p>People involved in such efforts say that they can help to instill pride in a heritage or neighborhood, prevent destruction of sites, and show a neglected side of history.</p><p>Studies by Pequots</p><p>''This tribe has long placed emphasis on history not in the books,'' said Kate Poole, an anthropologist who is museum coordinator for the Mashantucket Pequots at their reservation in Ledyard. The tribe is working to establish a museum detailing its history, and part of the reservation - including the rocks where councils were held and a 19th-century farmhouse that was home to members of the tribe - is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p><p>The tribe has sponsored several archeological studies on the reservation. ''Some sites are as old as 9,000 years,'' Ms. Poole said. With a grant from the National Parks Service, the tribe also conducted an archeological survey of the site of a Pequot fort in what is now Mystic, where hundreds of Pequots were killed in 1637 when the colonist John Mason and his forces attacked. Ms. Poole added that recognition of sites could prevent situations like one in Niantic, where development has disturbed Indian burial grounds.</p><p>The Afro-American Heritage Project, undertaken by the New Haven Preservation Trust, documented buildings and neighborhoods that reflect the city's black heritage. The project, financed by the Connecticut Humanities Council, was begun in 1985 by Preston Maynard, then director of the trust, and continued by Peter Haller, the next director.</p><p>The trust's work included producing a brochure and an audio tape guiding people to significant sites like Trowbridge Square and the former Goffe Street School.</p><p>Trowbridge Square - several blocks of mostly modest frame houses in the City Point area of New Haven - was first developed around 1830 by Simeon Jocelyn. An abolitionist who espoused a philosophy of social responsibility, Jocelyn built houses that were, Mr. Haller said, ''meant for the working class, especially blacks.'' The brick Greek Revival building at 106 Goffe Street which today is a Masonic temple was built around 1860 as a school for black children.</p><p>Mr. Haller noted that projects like Afro-American Heritage are valuable in part because knowing the historical value of a poor neighborhood can sometimes be a first step in revitalizing the neighborhood, and in giving its residents a sense of pride and caring.</p><p>The Washburn exhibit, ''Alice Washburn Celebrated,'' will open on March 4 at the Eli Whitney Museum in Hamden. It will show the work of Mrs. Washburn (1870-1958), who between 1919 and 1931 designed and built more than 80 homes in Cheshire, Hamden, and New Haven. Principal researcher for the project was Martha Yellig of Hamden, who in 1984, as an undergraduate at Southern Connecticut State University, began to document Washburn houses for an art history paper. Ms. Yellig found ''a treasure trove,'' said Willam Brown, director of the museum.</p><p>He said that Mrs. Washburn was unusual not only because she was a woman who designed houses and ran a construction business, but also because she produced so many houses in so few years. ''And they are remarkable houses,'' he said.</p><p>He noted that Mrs. Washburn's houses range ''from simple to quite grand,'' are much loved by their owners, sometimes have quirky touches like windows in the linen closets, and are of Colonial Revival style but show Mrs. Washburn's sense of the suburban future: They have attached (and often two-car) garages. The exhibit will run to June 17 and will be accompanied by tours and lectures. ''People will know Alice Washburn's name when we're through,'' said Mr. Brown.</p><p>Commission staff members and others say that they do not know just where they will find more names and places representing the history of women and minorities. Anyone wishing to suggest a site may write or call the Connecticut Historical Commission, 59 South Prospect Street, Hartford, Conn. 06106.</p><p>David Poirier, staff archeologist for the commission, said that the Native American Heritage Advisory Council, a group appointed by the Governor, would advise the commission about Indian places, especially burial grounds and sacred sites. ''We will welcome suggestions for possible sites fom anyone,'' he added.</p><p>Mr. Haller, who recently left the New Haven Preservation Trust to become executive director of New London Landmarks, said that he is sure that New London has buildings significant to black history but that he has not had time to identify them. Ms. Murray noted that she has a few tantalizing but meager bits of information on other possible sites.</p><p>''There are things we've heard about,'' she said. She recently heard of a school for blacks in Shelton and noticed a reference in ''Connecticut Place Names''(published by the Connecticut Historical Society) citing Glasgo, a village in eastern Connecticut, as being named for Isaac Glasko, who was of black and Indian descent and who early in the 19th century developed a business in marine hardware and whaling implements.</p><p>Regarding Asian-American and Latin American sites, Ms. Murray said, ''we don't have anything we can cite, but we're looking.'' She said that the commission will be contacting minority newspapers and organizations. But for now, she said, ''We don't know what exists out there.''</p><p>Photos; Among Connecticut sites that reflect the history of women and minorities are the brick Greek revival building on Goffe Street in New Haven, left, which was built around 1860 as a school for black children. It is now a Masonic temple. A coming exhibit in Hamden will focus on Alice Washburn, who designed and built more than 80 houses, among them these two in Hamden, between 1919 and 1931.</p>                </div>
