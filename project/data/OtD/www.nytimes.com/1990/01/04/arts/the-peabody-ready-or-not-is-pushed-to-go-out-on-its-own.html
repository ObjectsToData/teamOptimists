                    <p>One of cultural Baltimore's favorite sons is in danger of becoming its fiscal orphan. The Peabody Conservatory, a source of civic pride since 1857, is suffering its biggest crisis since Johns Hopkins University rescued it from extinction 12 years ago.</p><p>Johns Hopkins, Peabody's affluent neighbor, has subsidized most of the music school's increasing deficits since 1977 - a sum exceeding $20 million. Now faced with money pressures of its own, Johns Hopkins has tendered a plan that would drastically reduce the university's support and nudge Peabody in the direction of self-sufficiency. One of Maryland's most powerful politicians, however, has other ideas for its future.</p><p>Peabody, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins, is ranked close to such elite music schools as Juilliard, Curtis, Eastman, Oberlin, Michigan and Indiana. It has produced graduates like the composers Dominick Argento and Philip Glass; Richard Cassilly, the tenor; the popular singer Roberta Flack; James Morris, an internationally known bass; Hugh Wolff, the conductor; the pianist Andre Watts; the band leader Tommy Newsome, and Virgil Fox, the organist.</p><p>Peabody graduates perform in the Boston, St. Louis, San Francisco and Baltimore Symphonies and play a big part in the symphonic and educational life of Maryland. Peabody has traditionally been known as the music school that attracts talent from the Southeastern states.</p>                </div>

                    <p>An Unlikely Ally</p><p>But the school, it is generally agreed, has fed for 40 years on its reputation and its previous endowment. Fund-raising has been negligible, principal has been spent to pay annual deficits, and buildings, faculty salaries and morale have deteriorated. Peabody's current endowment is $10 million, a fraction of the reserves held by Juilliard or Curtis.</p><p>Peabody has found an unlikely ally in Melvin A. Steinberg, Maryland's Lieutenant Governor. Mr. Steinberg - neither an educator nor an arts figure but a hard-nosed politician - has been heading a state task force to rescue Peabody as a private institution and restore its health.</p><p>Filled with enthusiasm and armed with political cunning, Mr. Steinberg has devised a fragile plan that would twist the arms of Johns Hopkins, the Legislature and the private sector with just enough pleasurable pain to get the school through its immediate dangers and raise an endowment of $80 million by the next century.</p><p>The Steinberg plan, which needs legislative approval, consists of a series of offers he hopes all parties will accept. Under the plan, the state will put up $15 million and Peabody will put up its art collection as collateral. The collection, mainly American masters in museums around the city, is not to be touched. If Peabody does not live up to its part of Mr. Steinberg's delicate bargain, the school will return the $15 million and get its art back.</p><p>Recent Signs of Life</p><p>Peabody's job is to raise $15 million on its own from the private sector by July 1, a project in which Mr. Steinberg will take an active part. The state will subsidize Peabody to the tune of $5.9 million a year until 1996, at which time Peabody is to begin a campaign to raise enough money to build a self-sustaining endowment of $80 million. Johns Hopkins will continue to address Peabody's deficits for the next few years. The $3 million that Peabody will cost Hopkins this year, if the Steinberg plan is adopted, is far above the $500,000 the university's retrenchment proposal specified. The annual burden for Johns Hopkins, however, will diminish as Peabody's endowment money comes in.</p><p>Robert O. Pierce, a former principal horn player in the Baltimore Symphony, became Peabody's director in 1981 and has tried with some success to upgrade the faculty and facilities. Money was found for a new building, now under construction, to house a library, studios and classrooms. Leon Fleischer, the pianist and teacher, has attracted students from around the world; teachers like Berl Senofsky, Sylvia Rosenberg, Earl Carlyss and Stephen Kates have brought in good string players. Some of the school's faculty members commute regularly to Baltimore at Peabody's expense.</p><p>Problems at Johns Hopkins</p><p>Dr. Steven Muller, president of Johns Hopkins since 1972, was both Peabody's savior in 1977 and the formulator of the plan now threatening its future. Dr. Muller has problems of his own. An educator with expansionist ideas, he started programs in the 1970's and 80's that rebuilt the physical plant of the arts and sciences division and branched out as far as Nanjing, China.</p><p>Given Johns Hopkins's recent success in raising $610 million, financing all these ventures would seem relatively easy, but Hopkins is not the usual university. Like medieval Italy, it is made up of largely autonomous medical, engineering, public health and other divisions, each entrusted with financing itself and each with a tendency to guard its own assets.</p><p>Dr. Muller, who is alternately accused of overambition and praised as a visionary, leaves office in June.</p><p>''Over half that money was raised for the medical school,'' he said. ''Ninety-seven percent comes from 2 or 3 percent of all donors, and gifts of $100,000 or more tend to be for specific purposes, to endow a chair for example. The medical school has an enormous capacity to sustain itself -research grants, gifts from grateful patients, gifts from people anticipating being patients in the future.</p><p>''Departments like the humanities or music, on the other hand, don't tend to produce affluent alumni.''</p><p>Borrowing for Peabody</p><p>Dr. Muller has persuaded richer divisions to help the financially weaker ones, but money has been borrowed to pay for the arts and sciences expansion and has made Peabody something of a sacrificial lamb.</p><p>After 20 years in the Legislature, Mr. Steinberg has weighed his potential supporters and opponents with care. ''I wanted a consultant's report that also talked about quality,'' he said. Joseph Polisi, the head of Juilliard, was enlisted and backed up Peabody's character and potential. He also suggested that enlarging or reducing the school's 430-student enrollment would damage the school scholastically and not improve its finances.</p><p>Mr. Steinberg's second marketing point is tradition and history. ''I don't think that any politician now in office wants to have it on his record that Peabody died on his watch,'' he said. ''Maryland has a tight financial situation now, but I'm saying that an economy of a place is based on its environment. Peabody is an important part of our environment and if we lose it, it's gone forever.''</p><p>The Next Step</p><p>Despite a recent $40 million fund-raising drive for the Baltimore Symphony, Mr. Steinberg doesn't think the philanthropic well is dry. Like Jacques Schlenger, the head of Peabody's board, he says he thinks the money is out there and probably resides with the same sources that have been generous in the past. ''Now I can go out and say that the government is behind this,'' Mr. Steinberg said. He indicated that Maryland's Governor, William Donald Schaefer, backs his plan, which will be presented to the Legislature this month and be resolved by early spring.</p><p>''If we had known what we were getting into in 1977, I doubt that we would have taken Peabody on,'' Dr. Muller said. In insisting that the acquisition was never intended as decorative or image-making, he admits that Johns Hopkins sometimes labors under its vast but one-note reputation for medicine. ''The question people always get when they say they went to school here is, 'And what kind of doctor are you?'</p><p>Photo: Lieut. Gov. Melvin A.
