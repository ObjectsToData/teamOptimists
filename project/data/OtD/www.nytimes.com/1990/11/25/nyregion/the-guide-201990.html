    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  POETRY AND HEALING    Three nurses who are published poets will read from their work on Thursday at 5 P.M. as part of the Humanities in Medicine lecture series organized by the School of Medicine at Yale. Jeanne LeVasseur, an instructor at Yale's School of Nursing and a family nurse in outpatient clinics, coordinated the session and is one of the poets.    The program is called &quot;Healing Words: The Practice of Poetry in the Healing Arts.&quot; But Ms. LeVasseur said:    &quot;We don't use poetry as a therapeutic modality, although that is something that is being considered, just as music, art and dance are used therapeutically.    &quot;Speaking for myself, writing poetry helps me interpret and understand what I do as a nurse. There is a link between paying a great deal of attention to what a patient is saying in order to understand him or her and paying that kind of attention to an environment that suggests an idea for a poem.&quot;    Her colleagues in the reading will be Belle Waring, an intensive-care unit nurse from George Washington University Hospital in Washington, and Theodore Deppe, a psychiatric nurse from Natching Hospital in Mansfield. All three have been students in a master's degree program in poetry at Vermont College.    &quot;We will be reading mostly from a selection of poems that come out of our work,&quot; said Ms. LeVasseur. &quot;They can be kind of troubling, and they are not the ones that we would choose to read elsewhere.&quot;    The session will be held in the Beaumont Room of the School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, and there is no charge for admission. For more information, call 785-5494. FOLK ROCK     Gruppa Yabloko is Russian for Apple Group, and while that may sound like a computer-based mutual fund, it is a folk-rock ensemble from Leningrad. Marina Kapura, the lead vocalist, has been described by Pete Seeger as &quot;the Joan Baez of the Soviet Union.&quot; Her husband, Yuri Berendyukov, is the guitarist; Alexander Brovko plays the harmonica and guitar, Victor Potolov is a vocalist, and Sergei Smolyaninov is a singer and keyboardist who also plays the harmonica and the goosly, a traditional Russian stringed instrument.    The group will give two performances in Connecticut this week. The first is on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in the Rogers Park Junior High School on Rogers Park Road in Danbury, where admission will be $5 at the door. The second show is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. on Wednesday at Roaring Brook Nature Center on Gracey Road in Canton. Admission will be $12, and reservations may be made by calling 693-0263. TEXTBOOK OF CRAFTS     For more than two decades, the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven has held an annual craft show that is a textbook of the best in American crafts. Always scheduled before Christmas, it can provide one-stop shopping for those who are inclined to give gifts of art. The 22d edition will run through Dec. 23 at the workshop's headquarters, 80 Audubon Street.    Whimsy and humor as well as beauty and fine worksmanship are be found in the one-of-a-kind items that attract buyers from several states each year. The range of items is wide: Sally Rooney's tables are adorned with cartoon paintings that cover the surfaces. E. Wynne Noble's functional earthenware bowls, platters and vases are executed in bold orange, black and white spots and striations. And there is a large assortment of tree ornaments that includes some made of hand-blown glass.    Unusual jewelry priced from $4 to $400 is on dislpay, as well as jewelry boxes that are shaped like pyramids, palaces, or simple wooden rectangles embellished with lacquer. And there are painted-canvas floor coverings that are gaining acceptance as an alternative to rugs, plus a broad selection of knitted sweaters and jackets, woven silk scarves and men's ties in a blend of silk, cotton and wool.    In addition, there are sturdy wooden toys, soft-sculptured dolls, fireplace tools and all manner of paper products and ceramics. The workshop is open Monday to Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 2 to 5 P.M. The phone number is 562-4927. RUSSIAN PLAYWRIGHTS     Contemporary theater in the Soviet Union is the subject of a festival and symposium at Trinity College in Hartford on Friday from 2 to 11 P.M., Saturday from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M., and next Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 1 P.M.    Of special interest are two plays to be performed with the participation of their Russian playwrights. They are &quot;Stars in the Morning Sky&quot; by Alexander Galin, to be seen at 7 P.M. on Friday, and &quot;Kafka: Father and Son&quot; by Mark Roskovsky, scheduled at 9:30 P.M. on Friday and 8 P.M. on Saturday. All performances are in the Goodwin Theater on campus.    Panelists will discuss &quot;Contemporary Theater in the Soviet Union&quot; at 1:15 P.M. on Saturday, followed at 3:15 by &quot;Soviet-American Theater Exchange.&quot; Participants will include Mr. Galin and Mr. Roskovsky; George White, director of the O'Neill Theater in Watertown, where he initiated an exchange program with Russian theaters; Ron Jenkins, organizer of exchanges between Emerson College and theaters in Moscow; Leonard Shapiro, who directed &quot;Kafka: Father and Son&quot; in Moscow last year; Michael Yurieff, a member of the Russian studies faculty at Norwich University, and Catharine Lahti, a member of the modern languages faculty at Trinity and a specialist in Russian theater.    Registration for all events, including readings scheduled throughout the three days and receptions for the playwrights and performers, costs $15. Admission to the panels and readings is free, and tickets for individual performances of the plays are avialable at $6, or $4 for students and the elderly. For more information and a complete schedule, call 297-2209. FESTIVAL OF TREES     The Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield celebrates a festival of trees today from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. but with an extra added attraction -- a tree decorated with 500 bookmarks autographed by 250 celebrities, for sale at $10 to $100. There are two of each bookmark, and a list of them will be available near the roped-off tree, where visitors may make their purchases. The two $100 bookmarks were signed by Leonard Bernstein.    As for the rest, the list is a bit overwhelming. It includes Woody Allen, Isaac Azimov, Melvin Belli, Candice Bergen, Erma Bombeck, Ray Bradbury, Jimmy Doolittle, Gerald Ford, John Kenneth Galbraith, Alexander Haig, James Herriott, Katharine Hepburn, Jim (Catfish) Hunter, Lee Iacocca, P. D. James, Calvin Klein, Henry Kissinger, Zubin Mehta, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ralph Nader, Gregory Peck, Frank Perdue, Nancy Reagan, Fred Rogers, Beverly Sills, Benjamin Spock, Isaac Stern, Garry Trudeau, Donald Trump, Desmond Tutu, Vanna White, and Rose Mary Woods.     As for the 100 trees on display, they vary in size and theme from miniature to six feet, from teddy bears to partridges in pear trees. Prices range from $15 to $200. Admission is $5, free to children.    The library is behind Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s house at 160 South Street. Call 567-8030 for more information.">

	data-description="  POETRY AND HEALING    Three nurses who are published poets will read from their work on Thursday at 5 P.M. as part of the Humanities in Medicine lecture series organized by the School of Medicine at Yale. Jeanne LeVasseur, an instructor at Yale's School of Nursing and a family nurse in outpatient clinics, coordinated the session and is one of the poets.    The program is called "Healing Words: The Practice of Poetry in the Healing Arts." But Ms. LeVasseur said:    "We don't use poetry as a therapeutic modality, although that is something that is being considered, just as music, art and dance are used therapeutically.    "Speaking for myself, writing poetry helps me interpret and understand what I do as a nurse. There is a link between paying a great deal of attention to what a patient is saying in order to understand him or her and paying that kind of attention to an environment that suggests an idea for a poem."    Her colleagues in the reading will be Belle Waring, an intensive-care unit nurse from George Washington University Hospital in Washington, and Theodore Deppe, a psychiatric nurse from Natching Hospital in Mansfield. All three have been students in a master's degree program in poetry at Vermont College.    "We will be reading mostly from a selection of poems that come out of our work," said Ms. LeVasseur. "They can be kind of troubling, and they are not the ones that we would choose to read elsewhere."    The session will be held in the Beaumont Room of the School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, and there is no charge for admission. For more information, call 785-5494. FOLK ROCK     Gruppa Yabloko is Russian for Apple Group, and while that may sound like a computer-based mutual fund, it is a folk-rock ensemble from Leningrad. Marina Kapura, the lead vocalist, has been described by Pete Seeger as "the Joan Baez of the Soviet Union." Her husband, Yuri Berendyukov, is the guitarist; Alexander Brovko plays the harmonica and guitar, Victor Potolov is a vocalist, and Sergei Smolyaninov is a singer and keyboardist who also plays the harmonica and the goosly, a traditional Russian stringed instrument.    The group will give two performances in Connecticut this week. The first is on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in the Rogers Park Junior High School on Rogers Park Road in Danbury, where admission will be $5 at the door. The second show is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. on Wednesday at Roaring Brook Nature Center on Gracey Road in Canton. Admission will be $12, and reservations may be made by calling 693-0263. TEXTBOOK OF CRAFTS     For more than two decades, the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven has held an annual craft show that is a textbook of the best in American crafts. Always scheduled before Christmas, it can provide one-stop shopping for those who are inclined to give gifts of art. The 22d edition will run through Dec. 23 at the workshop's headquarters, 80 Audubon Street.    Whimsy and humor as well as beauty and fine worksmanship are be found in the one-of-a-kind items that attract buyers from several states each year. The range of items is wide: Sally Rooney's tables are adorned with cartoon paintings that cover the surfaces. E. Wynne Noble's functional earthenware bowls, platters and vases are executed in bold orange, black and white spots and striations. And there is a large assortment of tree ornaments that includes some made of hand-blown glass.    Unusual jewelry priced from $4 to $400 is on dislpay, as well as jewelry boxes that are shaped like pyramids, palaces, or simple wooden rectangles embellished with lacquer. And there are painted-canvas floor coverings that are gaining acceptance as an alternative to rugs, plus a broad selection of knitted sweaters and jackets, woven silk scarves and men's ties in a blend of silk, cotton and wool.    In addition, there are sturdy wooden toys, soft-sculptured dolls, fireplace tools and all manner of paper products and ceramics. The workshop is open Monday to Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 2 to 5 P.M. The phone number is 562-4927. RUSSIAN PLAYWRIGHTS     Contemporary theater in the Soviet Union is the subject of a festival and symposium at Trinity College in Hartford on Friday from 2 to 11 P.M., Saturday from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M., and next Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 1 P.M.    Of special interest are two plays to be performed with the participation of their Russian playwrights. They are "Stars in the Morning Sky" by Alexander Galin, to be seen at 7 P.M. on Friday, and "Kafka: Father and Son" by Mark Roskovsky, scheduled at 9:30 P.M. on Friday and 8 P.M. on Saturday. All performances are in the Goodwin Theater on campus.    Panelists will discuss "Contemporary Theater in the Soviet Union" at 1:15 P.M. on Saturday, followed at 3:15 by "Soviet-American Theater Exchange." Participants will include Mr. Galin and Mr. Roskovsky; George White, director of the O'Neill Theater in Watertown, where he initiated an exchange program with Russian theaters; Ron Jenkins, organizer of exchanges between Emerson College and theaters in Moscow; Leonard Shapiro, who directed "Kafka: Father and Son" in Moscow last year; Michael Yurieff, a member of the Russian studies faculty at Norwich University, and Catharine Lahti, a member of the modern languages faculty at Trinity and a specialist in Russian theater.    Registration for all events, including readings scheduled throughout the three days and receptions for the playwrights and performers, costs $15. Admission to the panels and readings is free, and tickets for individual performances of the plays are avialable at $6, or $4 for students and the elderly. For more information and a complete schedule, call 297-2209. FESTIVAL OF TREES     The Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield celebrates a festival of trees today from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. but with an extra added attraction -- a tree decorated with 500 bookmarks autographed by 250 celebrities, for sale at $10 to $100. There are two of each bookmark, and a list of them will be available near the roped-off tree, where visitors may make their purchases. The two $100 bookmarks were signed by Leonard Bernstein.    As for the rest, the list is a bit overwhelming. It includes Woody Allen, Isaac Azimov, Melvin Belli, Candice Bergen, Erma Bombeck, Ray Bradbury, Jimmy Doolittle, Gerald Ford, John Kenneth Galbraith, Alexander Haig, James Herriott, Katharine Hepburn, Jim (Catfish) Hunter, Lee Iacocca, P. D. James, Calvin Klein, Henry Kissinger, Zubin Mehta, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ralph Nader, Gregory Peck, Frank Perdue, Nancy Reagan, Fred Rogers, Beverly Sills, Benjamin Spock, Isaac Stern, Garry Trudeau, Donald Trump, Desmond Tutu, Vanna White, and Rose Mary Woods.     As for the 100 trees on display, they vary in size and theme from miniature to six feet, from teddy bears to partridges in pear trees. Prices range from $15 to $200. Admission is $5, free to children.    The library is behind Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s house at 160 South Street. Call 567-8030 for more information."></div>

                    <p>"Speaking for myself, writing poetry helps me interpret and understand what I do as a nurse. There is a link between paying a great deal of attention to what a patient is saying in order to understand him or her and paying that kind of attention to an environment that suggests an idea for a poem."</p><p>Her colleagues in the reading will be Belle Waring, an intensive-care unit nurse from George Washington University Hospital in Washington, and Theodore Deppe, a psychiatric nurse from Natching Hospital in Mansfield. All three have been students in a master's degree program in poetry at Vermont College.</p><p>"We will be reading mostly from a selection of poems that come out of our work," said Ms. LeVasseur. "They can be kind of troubling, and they are not the ones that we would choose to read elsewhere."</p><p>The session will be held in the Beaumont Room of the School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, and there is no charge for admission. For more information, call 785-5494. FOLK ROCK</p><p>Gruppa Yabloko is Russian for Apple Group, and while that may sound like a computer-based mutual fund, it is a folk-rock ensemble from Leningrad. Marina Kapura, the lead vocalist, has been described by Pete Seeger as "the Joan Baez of the Soviet Union." Her husband, Yuri Berendyukov, is the guitarist; Alexander Brovko plays the harmonica and guitar, Victor Potolov is a vocalist, and Sergei Smolyaninov is a singer and keyboardist who also plays the harmonica and the goosly, a traditional Russian stringed instrument.</p><p>The group will give two performances in Connecticut this week. The first is on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in the Rogers Park Junior High School on Rogers Park Road in Danbury, where admission will be $5 at the door. The second show is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. on Wednesday at Roaring Brook Nature Center on Gracey Road in Canton. Admission will be $12, and reservations may be made by calling 693-0263. TEXTBOOK OF CRAFTS</p><p>For more than two decades, the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven has held an annual craft show that is a textbook of the best in American crafts. Always scheduled before Christmas, it can provide one-stop shopping for those who are inclined to give gifts of art. The 22d edition will run through Dec. 23 at the workshop's headquarters, 80 Audubon Street.</p><p>Whimsy and humor as well as beauty and fine worksmanship are be found in the one-of-a-kind items that attract buyers from several states each year. The range of items is wide: Sally Rooney's tables are adorned with cartoon paintings that cover the surfaces. E. Wynne Noble's functional earthenware bowls, platters and vases are executed in bold orange, black and white spots and striations. And there is a large assortment of tree ornaments that includes some made of hand-blown glass.</p><p>Unusual jewelry priced from $4 to $400 is on dislpay, as well as jewelry boxes that are shaped like pyramids, palaces, or simple wooden rectangles embellished with lacquer. And there are painted-canvas floor coverings that are gaining acceptance as an alternative to rugs, plus a broad selection of knitted sweaters and jackets, woven silk scarves and men's ties in a blend of silk, cotton and wool.</p><p>In addition, there are sturdy wooden toys, soft-sculptured dolls, fireplace tools and all manner of paper products and ceramics. The workshop is open Monday to Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 2 to 5 P.M. The phone number is 562-4927. RUSSIAN PLAYWRIGHTS</p><p>Contemporary theater in the Soviet Union is the subject of a festival and symposium at Trinity College in Hartford on Friday from 2 to 11 P.M., Saturday from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M., and next Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 1 P.M.</p><p>Of special interest are two plays to be performed with the participation of their Russian playwrights. They are "Stars in the Morning Sky" by Alexander Galin, to be seen at 7 P.M. on Friday, and "Kafka: Father and Son" by Mark Roskovsky, scheduled at 9:30 P.M. on Friday and 8 P.M. on Saturday. All performances are in the Goodwin Theater on campus.</p><p>Panelists will discuss "Contemporary Theater in the Soviet Union" at 1:15 P.M. on Saturday, followed at 3:15 by "Soviet-American Theater Exchange." Participants will include Mr. Galin and Mr. Roskovsky; George White, director of the O'Neill Theater in Watertown, where he initiated an exchange program with Russian theaters; Ron Jenkins, organizer of exchanges between Emerson College and theaters in Moscow; Leonard Shapiro, who directed "Kafka: Father and Son" in Moscow last year; Michael Yurieff, a member of the Russian studies faculty at Norwich University, and Catharine Lahti, a member of the modern languages faculty at Trinity and a specialist in Russian theater.</p><p>Registration for all events, including readings scheduled throughout the three days and receptions for the playwrights and performers, costs $15. Admission to the panels and readings is free, and tickets for individual performances of the plays are avialable at $6, or $4 for students and the elderly. For more information and a complete schedule, call 297-2209. FESTIVAL OF TREES</p><p>The Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield celebrates a festival of trees today from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. but with an extra added attraction -- a tree decorated with 500 bookmarks autographed by 250 celebrities, for sale at $10 to $100. There are two of each bookmark, and a list of them will be available near the roped-off tree, where visitors may make their purchases. The two $100 bookmarks were signed by Leonard Bernstein.</p><p>As for the rest, the list is a bit overwhelming. It includes Woody Allen, Isaac Azimov, Melvin Belli, Candice Bergen, Erma Bombeck, Ray Bradbury, Jimmy Doolittle, Gerald Ford, John Kenneth Galbraith, Alexander Haig, James Herriott, Katharine Hepburn, Jim (Catfish) Hunter, Lee Iacocca, P. D. James, Calvin Klein, Henry Kissinger, Zubin Mehta, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Ralph Nader, Gregory Peck, Frank Perdue, Nancy Reagan, Fred Rogers, Beverly Sills, Benjamin Spock, Isaac Stern, Garry Trudeau, Donald Trump, Desmond Tutu, Vanna White, and Rose Mary Woods.</p><p>As for the 100 trees on display, they vary in size and theme from miniature to six feet, from teddy bears to partridges in pear trees. Prices range from $15 to $200. Admission is $5, free to children.</p><p>The library is behind Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s house at 160 South Street. Call 567-8030 for more information.</p>                </div>
