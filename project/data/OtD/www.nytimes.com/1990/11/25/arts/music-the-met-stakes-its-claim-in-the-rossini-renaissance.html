    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  In a revival long overdue, Gioachino Rossini's &quot;Semiramide,&quot; his Babylonian tale of love, murder, and incest, will return to the Metropolitan Opera on Friday. Although the opera has been revived successfully in theaters throughout Europe and the United States (including Chicago and San Francisco), this will be the first New York staging since it appeared at the Met in the 1890's, with Nellie Melba (of peach Melba fame) in the title role.    The last serious opera by Rossini to be produced at the Met was &quot;The Siege of Corinth.&quot; The date was April 7, 1975, and Beverly Sills was making her Met debut, an event greeted with a flood of genuine emotion from the adoring audiences that had followed her career in the New York State Theater, across the plaza at Lincoln Center.">

                    <p>In a revival long overdue, Gioachino Rossini's "Semiramide," his Babylonian tale of love, murder, and incest, will return to the Metropolitan Opera on Friday. Although the opera has been revived successfully in theaters throughout Europe and the United States (including Chicago and San Francisco), this will be the first New York staging since it appeared at the Met in the 1890's, with Nellie Melba (of peach Melba fame) in the title role.</p><p>The last serious opera by Rossini to be produced at the Met was "The Siege of Corinth." The date was April 7, 1975, and Beverly Sills was making her Met debut, an event greeted with a flood of genuine emotion from the adoring audiences that had followed her career in the New York State Theater, across the plaza at Lincoln Center.</p><p>For lovers of bel canto opera, however, the event also provoked a bitter debate. On one side were those who held that such operas exist primarily to provide vehicles for superstars; on the other were those who insisted that Rossini's operas possess musical and dramatic integrity. According to the former, the Met's "Siege" succeeded gloriously; according to the latter, it was a desecration. That "The Siege of Corinth" exists in several versions authorized by the composer did not simplify the terms of the debate.</p><p>The Met's "Siege," and a similar production of the opera at the Teatro Alla Scala of Milan in 1969, did have one enduring effect; they helped motivate the Rossini Foundation of Pesaro (the composer's birthplace) to begin preparing accurate, complete editions of his works. The resulting texts (some 20 operas are already available) have transformed knowledge of Rossini's music and performances in theaters around the world.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Italians go so far as to speak of a "Rossini Renaissance"; operas totally unknown 15 years ago -- "Tancredi," "L'Occasione Fa il Ladro," "La Donna del Lago" -- have been performed extensively. It is no longer surprising to find "Bianca e Falliero" in Miami, "Maometto II" in San Francisco or "Il Viaggio a Reims" in St. Louis. In 1968, for the 100th anniversary of Rossini's death, most American theaters trotted out yet another tired production of "The Barber of Seville"; these same theaters are approaching the bicentenary of his birth, in 1992, with plans to produce "Ermione," "Guillaume Tell," "La Gazza Ladra," "Armida" and "Otello" (yes, Rossini's "Otello").</p><p>With "Semiramide" (pronounced say-mee-RAH-mee-day) which is to be performed at the Met in the new critical edition of the Rossini Foundation, the serious operas of Rossini return to the New York stage. In the cast are four of the world's greatest Rossini singers: Lella Cuberli, Marilyn Horne, Chris Merritt and Samuel Ramey. The production team (John Copley, John Conklin and Michael Stennett) was responsible for Chicago Lyric Opera's beautiful "Tancredi" in 1988-89. Only the conductor, James Conlon, is approaching this repertory for the first time, but he does so from formidable experience in Italian opera.</p><p>Why "Semiramide"? This opera, first performed in Venice, at the Teatro la Fenice, on Feb. 3, 1823, marked the end of Rossini's meteoric career in Italy: in the course of some 14 years his 34 operas had changed the face of Italian music. Although he was equally renowned as a composer of comic and serious operas, after 1817 Rossini's attentions were ever more focused on    opera seria   . His rate of production also slowed considerably. His later operas (from 1820 on) were written at the rate of one a year. We have considerable documentation about the creation of "Semiramide," and we know he was hard at work on the score some five months before the premiere.</p><p>Rossini's most unusual, even experimental works were those he wrote for Naples during his tenure as musical director of the Neapolitan theaters from 1815 through 1822. Having pushed the conventions of Italian opera (conventions he himself had largely formulated) further than audiences of the time could accept, he retreated with "Semiramide" into a more classical operatic style. It preserves the monumentality and musical richness of the Neapolitan works, but does so within a more traditionally conceived framework of arias and duets.</p><p>After the premiere of "Semiramide," Rossini settled in Paris, where his compositional activity culminated in "Guillaume Tell" of 1829. His subsequent retirement from the operatic stage has continued to puzzle biographers seeking simple answers to life's ambiguities. Explanations can be sought in some combination of Rossini's emotional state after the death of his mother, his poor health and his relative affluence. All these elements were activated by the artistic crisis that followed the lukewarm public reception of "Tell" (not unlike the reception that had greeted his more advanced Neapolitan operas).</p><p>Despite their historical importance and the great popular success they are having in our own day, Rossini's serious operas continue to divide critical opinion. Most of them partake of the austerity of neo-classical dramatic style, not the blood-and-thunder histrionics of Romantic tragedy and midcentury Italian melodrama. "Semiramide," for example, is derived from a play by Voltaire (with hints of both "Oedipus" and "Hamlet"): key players include the Babylonian queen, the warrior she loves (who turns out to be her son), the ghost of her murdered husband, her treacherous accomplice. But all these elements are worked out in a libretto, by Gaetano Rossi, of classical poise and precision.</p>                </div>
