                    <p>The debate over school choice is rather like a Ping-Pong match that so far, no one has won.</p><p>The latest to venture out to volley were Pete du Pont, the former Governor of Delaware, and Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, at a debate on Tuesday sponsored by the United States Department of Education.</p><p>The argument for parental choice in education maintains that if people can choose freely among schools the competition for students will force schools to shape up or shut down. Proponents of the policy, which has been adopted so far in half a dozen states in varying degrees, argue that choice will lead to better education and more efficient schools. Critics contend that the free-market mechanics of choice mean that thousands of poor children would be left behind, the detritus of disintegrating schools.</p><p>One of the nation's most widely heralded choice programs, in which poor children in Milwaukee have been given the chance to attend private schools using state financing, was struck down by a Wisconsin appeals court today on a technicality. It had gone into effect in September, and was expected to remain in effect for the 30 days allowed by the court for filing appeals.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In the Washington debate, Mr. du Pont -- unaware of the court's decision, which was being issued as he spoke -- continually referred to the Milwaukee plan as evidence of the benefits of school choice. The program, strictly for low-income Milwaukee students, has allowed 367 students to enroll in private schools. It was passed by the Wisconsin Legislature in March. Emphasis on Market Forces</p><p>Mr. du Pont, who heads Ideas for America's Future, a group formed to push for educational changes, repeated the main argument for choice, that marketplace forces will do for education what he said they do for the marketplace: allow the best products to survive and give consumers the best choices.</p><p>"If anything, the 1980's showed that the marketplace works," said Mr. du Pont. He said the Wisconsin choice program had forced "the entire Milwaukee school system to turn itself upside down" to try to improve, and had given poor people the same options that the well-off have in choosing where to send their children to school.</p><p>Parents, "not that bureaucrat that no one can name," ought to be able to decide which school their children attend, he said.</p><p>Mr. Geiger, whose organization represents the majority of the nation's teachers, argued that the educational crisis was not solely caused by inefficiencies in public schools. He said it was the result of complex social problems including the decline of two-parent families and increases in drug use and crime. Pointing to Market Problems</p><p>He also said other countries like Sweden, France, Japan and Canada, where students are doing better academically than their American counterparts, spend far more money on health care, parental leave from work, and other family social support programs than the United States does.</p><p>Mr. Geiger lauded the choice system in Harlem's District No. 4, but he pointed out that it was not a totally free-market approach, but a very structured system in which certain schools offer certain specialties, and that parents are well-informed and carefully counseled on what the various choices for their children would mean.</p><p>Saying freedom to choose could be only one part of a total change in the entire public school system, he warned, "If choice is the centerpiece, reform will become a charade."</p><p>Mr. Geiger said there would be no change until "every school was choice-worthy," otherwise children from families with the fewest resources would end up with the lowest-quality schools.</p><p>He also raised the specter that choice would result in the segregation of the public school system, a situation that Mr. du Pont argued had already occurred in most major metropolitan school systems as middle-class, predominantly white families fled to the suburbs.</p><p>Today's debate, organized as part of American Education Week activites this week, was part of a continuing discussion about the best ways to reinvigorate an ailing public school system. Earlier this week, Lynn V. Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, released a Congressionally mandated report in which she criticized the public education bureaucracy as a key reason why educational change has made little headway in the last decade.</p><p>Choice has become a frequent topic in the current debate. Not a new concept in public education, since alternative schools, magnet schools and voluntary desegregation plans have been around for years, choice today emphasizes the marketplace aspects. The Reagan Administration promoted a proposal for tuition vouchers, which parents could use at public, parochial or private schools of their choice. The idea failed to win support from Congress because of fears that such a system would divert money to private schools and undermine public schools.</p><p>But as the academic standing of American students has continued to decline, President Bush and state educational officials have been promoting school choice as a solution.</p><p>Minnesota started the first statewide choice program in 1988. There, students can freely transfer between school districts as long as space is available and racial segregation does not result. Idaho, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio started programs this fall. At least 13 other states are considering similar plans.</p><p>The Wisconsin plan that was overturned by a court today, was the first to include the option of attending a private school but it was restricted to the Milwaukee schools.</p>                </div>
