    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  For Sale, but Still Hot    While negotiations continue for the sale of North Point Press, the well-regarded independent publishing house in San Francisco, one of its books will appear on the best-seller list in The New York Times on Sunday. &quot;Crow and Weasel,&quot; a fable by Barry Lopez, illustrated by Tom Pohrt, will appear at No. 15 on the hard-cover fiction list.   This marks the fourth best seller in North Point's 10-year history. The others were &quot;West With the Night&quot; and &quot;Splendid Outcast,&quot; both by Beryl Markham, and &quot;Son of the Morning Star,&quot; Evan Connell's novel about Custer at Little Big Horn. In April, North Point will publish Mr. Connell's new book, &quot;The Alchymists' Journal,&quot; a novel set in the 16th century.   Meantime, North Point has just published &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; by Dostoyevsky, with a highly praised new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.    The translators were aided by a grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities, and North Point took the unusual step of paying them royalties on the book, which is in the public domain.    LuAnn Walther, the executive editor of Vintage Books, bought the paperback rights to North Point's edition of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; while it was still being translated, then contracted with Mr. Pevear and Ms. Volokhonsky to translate Dostoyevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment,&quot; &quot;Notes From the Underground&quot; and &quot;The Possessed.&quot;  Sheldon's Soviet Publisher     Sidney Sheldon's &quot;Rage of Angels&quot; has been bought for an undisclosed sum by Politizdat Publishers in Moscow, and a different Soviet publisher is negotiating for Mr. Sheldon's &quot;Master of the Game.&quot;   Janklow &amp; Nesbit Associates, the agents, also sold rights in the Soviet Union this year to two non-fiction books, the speeches of Ronald Reagan and his memoir, &quot;An American Life.&quot; The memoir has not yet been published in the Soviet Union, but Cynthia Cannell, who sells foreign rights for the agency, said that the collected speeches &quot;sold out instantly.&quot; Albanian's New Work     Two weeks ago Ismail Kadare, a prominent Albanian novelist and poet, defected and sought political asylum in France, prompting an Albanian intellectual to compare Mr. Kadare's defection with Mark Twain's asking for political asylum in England.   As it happens, three of Mr. Kadare's novels are in print in the United States and a fourth will be publishedby year's end. As it also happens, Mr. Kadare's American publisher is a small press, New Amsterdam Books, a three-year-old New York house that specializes in literary fiction and nonfiction.   Keitha Capouya, president of New Amsterdam, said &quot;To show the folly we are capable of, we had not even started our publishing house when we bought an option on all Kadare's works.&quot; (&quot;We&quot; includes her husband, Emile, the company vice president.) The Capouyas read the French translations of Kadare's novels, and what attracted them, Mrs. Capouya said, was his literary quality and psychological penetration.   The first Kadare novel published by New Amsterdam was &quot;Chronicle in Stone&quot; (1987). In The New Yorker, John Updike pronounced it &quot;a thoroughly enchanting novel -- sophisticated and accomplished in its poetic prose and narrative deftness, yet drawing resonance from its roots in one of Europe's most primitive societies.&quot; That was followed by &quot;Doruntine&quot; (1988), a parable of love and death, and &quot;Broken April&quot; (1989).  The forthcoming novel, &quot;The General of the Dead Army,&quot; had actually been published in 1971 by Grossman Publishers. (Grossman, bought by Viking Press, had been celebrated as the publisher of Ralph Nader's &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed.&quot;)   Mrs. Capouya said that Mr. Kadare's novels have &quot;sold decently,&quot; and that &quot;Chronicle&quot; has been added to college courses on Eastern European literature. New Amsterdam has translations of two other Kadare novels, which will be published in due time, while two more are currently being translated into English. Rain Forest Still Topical     Amid the many recent books about the destruction of the rain forest, Citadel Press has reprinted &quot;Witch Doctor's Apprentice: Hunting for Medicinal Plants In the Amazon,&quot; by Nicole Maxwell. Published in 1961 and reprinted in 1975, the book was warmly reviewed by such experts on the Amazon as Richard Evans Schultes, the former director of Harvard's Botanical Museum, but it sold few copies because until recently there was little interest in the rain forest. Ms. Maxwell, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, celebrated her 85th birthday a few weeks ago. Currently at the Institute for Botanical Exploration at Mississippi State University, she is planning to return to the jungle in which she has spent many of the last 42 years.   &quot;It's been almost two years since I've been in the jungle, and I'm getting itchy to get back,&quot; Ms. Maxwell said in a telephone conversation from Starkville, Miss. &quot;It's my only addiction.&quot;   Ms. Maxwell said that while the destruction of the rain forest continues, she is more optimistic about its preservation than she has been in recent years. &quot;I was astonished when I came back to America to hear even people in supermarket lines and on buses talking about saving the rain forest,&quot; she said. &quot;They realize there are extremely valuable medicines coming out of there.&quot;">

	data-description="  For Sale, but Still Hot    While negotiations continue for the sale of North Point Press, the well-regarded independent publishing house in San Francisco, one of its books will appear on the best-seller list in The New York Times on Sunday. "Crow and Weasel," a fable by Barry Lopez, illustrated by Tom Pohrt, will appear at No. 15 on the hard-cover fiction list.   This marks the fourth best seller in North Point's 10-year history. The others were "West With the Night" and "Splendid Outcast," both by Beryl Markham, and "Son of the Morning Star," Evan Connell's novel about Custer at Little Big Horn. In April, North Point will publish Mr. Connell's new book, "The Alchymists' Journal," a novel set in the 16th century.   Meantime, North Point has just published "The Brothers Karamazov" by Dostoyevsky, with a highly praised new translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.    The translators were aided by a grant from the National Endowment of the Humanities, and North Point took the unusual step of paying them royalties on the book, which is in the public domain.    LuAnn Walther, the executive editor of Vintage Books, bought the paperback rights to North Point's edition of "The Brothers Karamazov" while it was still being translated, then contracted with Mr. Pevear and Ms. Volokhonsky to translate Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment," "Notes From the Underground" and "The Possessed."  Sheldon's Soviet Publisher     Sidney Sheldon's "Rage of Angels" has been bought for an undisclosed sum by Politizdat Publishers in Moscow, and a different Soviet publisher is negotiating for Mr. Sheldon's "Master of the Game."   Janklow & Nesbit Associates, the agents, also sold rights in the Soviet Union this year to two non-fiction books, the speeches of Ronald Reagan and his memoir, "An American Life." The memoir has not yet been published in the Soviet Union, but Cynthia Cannell, who sells foreign rights for the agency, said that the collected speeches "sold out instantly." Albanian's New Work     Two weeks ago Ismail Kadare, a prominent Albanian novelist and poet, defected and sought political asylum in France, prompting an Albanian intellectual to compare Mr. Kadare's defection with Mark Twain's asking for political asylum in England.   As it happens, three of Mr. Kadare's novels are in print in the United States and a fourth will be publishedby year's end. As it also happens, Mr. Kadare's American publisher is a small press, New Amsterdam Books, a three-year-old New York house that specializes in literary fiction and nonfiction.   Keitha Capouya, president of New Amsterdam, said "To show the folly we are capable of, we had not even started our publishing house when we bought an option on all Kadare's works." ("We" includes her husband, Emile, the company vice president.) The Capouyas read the French translations of Kadare's novels, and what attracted them, Mrs. Capouya said, was his literary quality and psychological penetration.   The first Kadare novel published by New Amsterdam was "Chronicle in Stone" (1987). In The New Yorker, John Updike pronounced it "a thoroughly enchanting novel -- sophisticated and accomplished in its poetic prose and narrative deftness, yet drawing resonance from its roots in one of Europe's most primitive societies." That was followed by "Doruntine" (1988), a parable of love and death, and "Broken April" (1989).  The forthcoming novel, "The General of the Dead Army," had actually been published in 1971 by Grossman Publishers. (Grossman, bought by Viking Press, had been celebrated as the publisher of Ralph Nader's "Unsafe at Any Speed.")   Mrs. Capouya said that Mr. Kadare's novels have "sold decently," and that "Chronicle" has been added to college courses on Eastern European literature. New Amsterdam has translations of two other Kadare novels, which will be published in due time, while two more are currently being translated into English. Rain Forest Still Topical     Amid the many recent books about the destruction of the rain forest, Citadel Press has reprinted "Witch Doctor's Apprentice: Hunting for Medicinal Plants In the Amazon," by Nicole Maxwell. Published in 1961 and reprinted in 1975, the book was warmly reviewed by such experts on the Amazon as Richard Evans Schultes, the former director of Harvard's Botanical Museum, but it sold few copies because until recently there was little interest in the rain forest. Ms. Maxwell, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, celebrated her 85th birthday a few weeks ago. Currently at the Institute for Botanical Exploration at Mississippi State University, she is planning to return to the jungle in which she has spent many of the last 42 years.   "It's been almost two years since I've been in the jungle, and I'm getting itchy to get back," Ms. Maxwell said in a telephone conversation from Starkville, Miss. "It's my only addiction."   Ms. Maxwell said that while the destruction of the rain forest continues, she is more optimistic about its preservation than she has been in recent years. "I was astonished when I came back to America to hear even people in supermarket lines and on buses talking about saving the rain forest," she said. "They realize there are extremely valuable medicines coming out of there.""></div>

"It's my only addiction."</p><p>Ms. Maxwell said that while the destruction of the rain forest continues, she is more optimistic about its preservation than she has been in recent years. "I was astonished when I came back to America to hear even people in supermarket lines and on buses talking about saving the rain forest," she said. "They realize there are extremely valuable medicines coming out of there."</p>                </div>
