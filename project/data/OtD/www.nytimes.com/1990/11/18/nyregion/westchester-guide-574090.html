    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  ALL-FAITHS THANKSGIVING    People of all religions will be welcome at 5 P.M. today for a Festival of Thanksgiving in which music and readings from many faiths will be followed by a potluck supper. The program will be held at the Jewish Community Center of White Plains, 252 Soundview Avenue.    Several local churches and temples have contributed to the program, which will include music and texts from the Bahai, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant, Roman Catholic and Unitarian Universalist traditions.    Participants are asked to take a dish that will serve six people and contains no pork or shellfish, in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. No reservations are necessary, and there is no charge for admission. Call 949-4717 for more information. 'NIGHT OF STARS'     Ida Kavafian and Steven Tenenbom, violinists; and Alan Menken, composer of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and winner of an Oscar for his &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; film score, are among the celebrities who will entertain at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts &quot;Night of Stars.&quot;    The performance begins at 7 P.M. today in the new Meese Auditorium of the Fox Lane High School on Route 172 in Bedford. Afterward, ticket holders will be treated to a dessert reception catered by local restaurants.    Among the actors contributing their talents are Zoe Caldwell, Larry Luckinbill and Adam Arkin. And from the New York City Ballet, principal dancers Peter Boal and Stacey Caddell will perform a Tchaikovsky &quot;Pas de Deux&quot; choreographed by George Balanchine.    Chris Groenandaal, who played the title role in &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; for a year on Broadway; Neil Gould, pianist and composer; the Nova Dance Ensemble; and excerpts from the Cole Porter musical &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; are also on the program. Tickets are $35 at the door, or call 232-5740 for more information. FISH STORIES     It may be off-season for trout fishing, but fish talk is always welcome to members and friends of the Croton Watershed chapter of Trout Unlimited. The nonprofit conservation group holds monthly meetings from September through May, where all manner of fishing-related topics are aired, open to the public free of charge.    At 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco, the meeting will focus on a discussion of the natural history of Patterson's Great Swamp, the headwaters for the Croton Reservoir system, where a variety of fish are found naturally or are stocked. The program will be led by Michael Ciaiola, president of both Save Open Spaces and Greenbelt of the Hudson Valley, two conservation groups in the Westchester-Putnam region.    Newcomers at the meetings are given a fly-of-the-month as a memento. The flies are tied by members throughout the year for that purpose. This month's fly is the Bucktail Streamer. For more information, call 666-5727. 'ANIMALS IN ART'     The Scarsdale Historical Society's new exhibition, &quot;The Portrayal of Animals in Art,&quot; is more wide-ranging than the title implies. While there are many works on canvas and paper -- by Picasso, Audubon, Currier &amp; Ives, the Wyeths and other well-known artists -- there are also animals interpreted as weather vanes, sculptured in metal, wood and porcelain and depicted in quilts and rugs. Several pieces of furniture featuring animal themes include an elaborate 1870 rosewood cabinet inlaid with a bucolic scene of a girl with goats, rabbits and farm tools.    Contributors to the exhibition include the Hudson River Museum, Historic Hudson Valley, the Scarsdale Public Library, Mimi Findlay Galleries, Leo Kaplan Ltd., Israel Sack, John Keith Russell Antiques and many other dealers and private collectors in Westchester and Manhattan.    The exhibition opens Wednesday and will run through March 3 at the Historical Society headquarters, 937 White Plains Post Road. Visiting hours are Wednesdays through Fridays from 1:30 to 4:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 4:30 P.M. Admission is $1.50 for adults, 75 cents for the elderly and 50 cents for students younger than 18. For more information, call 723-1744. ADOPTION SEMINARS     &quot;Adoption: The Decision and Beyond&quot; is the title of a conference organized by the Westchester-Rockland chapter of Adoptive Parents Committee of New York, to be held at the State University of New York at Purchase from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. today. Registration will be available until noon at a cost of $45 for an individual or couple.    Fifty one-hour seminars led by lawyers, adoption agency officials, academicians and members of the clergy will cover topics including single-parent adoptions, raising an adopted child; international, agency and individual methods of adoption; fears and fantasies associated with adoption, adoptive breast feeding, adoptive parents older than 40, treatments for infertility and others.    The conference is organized for people considering adoption, those who have already adopted, professionals in the field and anyone interested in learning more about the process.   Exhibits by Spence-Chapin Services, Latin America Parents Association, Catholic Family Service of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Discovery Toys, the County Department of Social Services' adoption and foster care unit, and many other agencies and organizations will be available.    The university is on Anderson Hill Road, and the conference will take place in the Humanities Building. For more information call 997-7859 or 251-6000. AUTHORS SPEAK     A literary symposium at Westchester Community College in Vallhalla this afternoon will feature talks by several well-known authors, and Roger W. Straus, founder and chief executive officer of Farrar, Straus, Giroux publishers, as the guest of honor.    &quot;Searching for the American Dream,&quot; as the event is called, begins at 2:30 P.M. in the Academic Arts Building, with talks and readings by the authors centered on their personal quests. They are Russell Banks, director of creative writing at Princeton and author of &quot;Afflictions&quot; and &quot;Continental Drift,&quot; concerned with third- and fourth-generation Americans; Gish Jen, a Chinese-American author; Cynthia Kadohata, a Japanese-American novelist; and Frederick Tuten, an Italian-American writer and director of a graduate program in creative writing at the City University.   John Palmer, former television news anchor, will serve as moderator. Tickets are $15 and $25 at the door or call 285-6670. The college is at 75 Grasslands Road.  BELT-TIGHTENING     After Thanksgiving each year, the County Parks Department offers overstuffed turkey eaters an opportunity to take off some inches around their mid-sections while providing a service to the environment.   At 2 P.M. Saturday the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye will welcome people bearing work gloves, saws and an appetite for hard work to help clear away small trees growing in the field and destroying the meadow habitat. The conservancy is on Route 1 just south of the Rye Golf Club. Call 835-4466 for more information.">

	data-description="  ALL-FAITHS THANKSGIVING    People of all religions will be welcome at 5 P.M. today for a Festival of Thanksgiving in which music and readings from many faiths will be followed by a potluck supper. The program will be held at the Jewish Community Center of White Plains, 252 Soundview Avenue.    Several local churches and temples have contributed to the program, which will include music and texts from the Bahai, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant, Roman Catholic and Unitarian Universalist traditions.    Participants are asked to take a dish that will serve six people and contains no pork or shellfish, in accordance with Jewish dietary laws. No reservations are necessary, and there is no charge for admission. Call 949-4717 for more information. 'NIGHT OF STARS'     Ida Kavafian and Steven Tenenbom, violinists; and Alan Menken, composer of "Little Shop of Horrors" and winner of an Oscar for his "Little Mermaid" film score, are among the celebrities who will entertain at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts "Night of Stars."    The performance begins at 7 P.M. today in the new Meese Auditorium of the Fox Lane High School on Route 172 in Bedford. Afterward, ticket holders will be treated to a dessert reception catered by local restaurants.    Among the actors contributing their talents are Zoe Caldwell, Larry Luckinbill and Adam Arkin. And from the New York City Ballet, principal dancers Peter Boal and Stacey Caddell will perform a Tchaikovsky "Pas de Deux" choreographed by George Balanchine.    Chris Groenandaal, who played the title role in "Phantom of the Opera" for a year on Broadway; Neil Gould, pianist and composer; the Nova Dance Ensemble; and excerpts from the Cole Porter musical "Kiss Me Kate" are also on the program. Tickets are $35 at the door, or call 232-5740 for more information. FISH STORIES     It may be off-season for trout fishing, but fish talk is always welcome to members and friends of the Croton Watershed chapter of Trout Unlimited. The nonprofit conservation group holds monthly meetings from September through May, where all manner of fishing-related topics are aired, open to the public free of charge.    At 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco, the meeting will focus on a discussion of the natural history of Patterson's Great Swamp, the headwaters for the Croton Reservoir system, where a variety of fish are found naturally or are stocked. The program will be led by Michael Ciaiola, president of both Save Open Spaces and Greenbelt of the Hudson Valley, two conservation groups in the Westchester-Putnam region.    Newcomers at the meetings are given a fly-of-the-month as a memento. The flies are tied by members throughout the year for that purpose. This month's fly is the Bucktail Streamer. For more information, call 666-5727. 'ANIMALS IN ART'     The Scarsdale Historical Society's new exhibition, "The Portrayal of Animals in Art," is more wide-ranging than the title implies. While there are many works on canvas and paper -- by Picasso, Audubon, Currier & Ives, the Wyeths and other well-known artists -- there are also animals interpreted as weather vanes, sculptured in metal, wood and porcelain and depicted in quilts and rugs. Several pieces of furniture featuring animal themes include an elaborate 1870 rosewood cabinet inlaid with a bucolic scene of a girl with goats, rabbits and farm tools.    Contributors to the exhibition include the Hudson River Museum, Historic Hudson Valley, the Scarsdale Public Library, Mimi Findlay Galleries, Leo Kaplan Ltd., Israel Sack, John Keith Russell Antiques and many other dealers and private collectors in Westchester and Manhattan.    The exhibition opens Wednesday and will run through March 3 at the Historical Society headquarters, 937 White Plains Post Road. Visiting hours are Wednesdays through Fridays from 1:30 to 4:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 4:30 P.M. Admission is $1.50 for adults, 75 cents for the elderly and 50 cents for students younger than 18. For more information, call 723-1744. ADOPTION SEMINARS     "Adoption: The Decision and Beyond" is the title of a conference organized by the Westchester-Rockland chapter of Adoptive Parents Committee of New York, to be held at the State University of New York at Purchase from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. today. Registration will be available until noon at a cost of $45 for an individual or couple.    Fifty one-hour seminars led by lawyers, adoption agency officials, academicians and members of the clergy will cover topics including single-parent adoptions, raising an adopted child; international, agency and individual methods of adoption; fears and fantasies associated with adoption, adoptive breast feeding, adoptive parents older than 40, treatments for infertility and others.    The conference is organized for people considering adoption, those who have already adopted, professionals in the field and anyone interested in learning more about the process.   Exhibits by Spence-Chapin Services, Latin America Parents Association, Catholic Family Service of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Discovery Toys, the County Department of Social Services' adoption and foster care unit, and many other agencies and organizations will be available.    The university is on Anderson Hill Road, and the conference will take place in the Humanities Building. For more information call 997-7859 or 251-6000. AUTHORS SPEAK     A literary symposium at Westchester Community College in Vallhalla this afternoon will feature talks by several well-known authors, and Roger W. Straus, founder and chief executive officer of Farrar, Straus, Giroux publishers, as the guest of honor.    "Searching for the American Dream," as the event is called, begins at 2:30 P.M. in the Academic Arts Building, with talks and readings by the authors centered on their personal quests. They are Russell Banks, director of creative writing at Princeton and author of "Afflictions" and "Continental Drift," concerned with third- and fourth-generation Americans; Gish Jen, a Chinese-American author; Cynthia Kadohata, a Japanese-American novelist; and Frederick Tuten, an Italian-American writer and director of a graduate program in creative writing at the City University.   John Palmer, former television news anchor, will serve as moderator. Tickets are $15 and $25 at the door or call 285-6670. The college is at 75 Grasslands Road.  BELT-TIGHTENING     After Thanksgiving each year, the County Parks Department offers overstuffed turkey eaters an opportunity to take off some inches around their mid-sections while providing a service to the environment.   At 2 P.M. Saturday the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye will welcome people bearing work gloves, saws and an appetite for hard work to help clear away small trees growing in the field and destroying the meadow habitat. The conservancy is on Route 1 just south of the Rye Golf Club. Call 835-4466 for more information."></div>

FISH STORIES</p><p>It may be off-season for trout fishing, but fish talk is always welcome to members and friends of the Croton Watershed chapter of Trout Unlimited. The nonprofit conservation group holds monthly meetings from September through May, where all manner of fishing-related topics are aired, open to the public free of charge.</p><p>At 7:30 P.M. Tuesday in the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco, the meeting will focus on a discussion of the natural history of Patterson's Great Swamp, the headwaters for the Croton Reservoir system, where a variety of fish are found naturally or are stocked. The program will be led by Michael Ciaiola, president of both Save Open Spaces and Greenbelt of the Hudson Valley, two conservation groups in the Westchester-Putnam region.</p><p>Newcomers at the meetings are given a fly-of-the-month as a memento.

'ANIMALS IN ART'</p><p>The Scarsdale Historical Society's new exhibition, "The Portrayal of Animals in Art," is more wide-ranging than the title implies.

Several pieces of furniture featuring animal themes include an elaborate 1870 rosewood cabinet inlaid with a bucolic scene of a girl with goats, rabbits and farm tools.</p><p>Contributors to the exhibition include the Hudson River Museum, Historic Hudson Valley, the Scarsdale Public Library, Mimi Findlay Galleries, Leo Kaplan Ltd., Israel Sack, John Keith Russell Antiques and many other dealers and private collectors in Westchester and Manhattan.</p><p>The exhibition opens Wednesday and will run through March 3 at the Historical Society headquarters, 937 White Plains Post Road.
