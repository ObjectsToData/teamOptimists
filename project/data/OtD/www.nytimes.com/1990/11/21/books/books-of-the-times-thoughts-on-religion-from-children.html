In the boldest and the most challenging of his series of books that probe the minds of children, Dr. Robert Coles turns on his tape recorder and listens to what they say about religion. It's an inchoate subject for adults and children. In &quot;The Spiritual Life of Children&quot; the answers are not particularly enlightening, and for good reason: it is hard to elicit original thoughts from the very young about religion that are not simplistic and derivative. Of course, it's essential to heed the voices of children, but for the general reader wisdom doesn't necessarily come out of the mouths of babes.">

                    <p>The Spiritual Life of Children  By Robert Coles  Illustrated. 358 pages. A Peter Davison Book/ Houghton Mifflin . $22.95.</p><p>In the boldest and the most challenging of his series of books that probe the minds of children, Dr. Robert Coles turns on his tape recorder and listens to what they say about religion. It's an inchoate subject for adults and children. In "The Spiritual Life of Children" the answers are not particularly enlightening, and for good reason: it is hard to elicit original thoughts from the very young about religion that are not simplistic and derivative. Of course, it's essential to heed the voices of children, but for the general reader wisdom doesn't necessarily come out of the mouths of babes.</p><p>The author, a professor of psychiatry and medical humanities at Harvard, deserves great respect for his pioneering work with children. To his many books and articles, he brings an inquiring and idealistic mind. The present book, he says, concludes 30 years of writing about children in various regions of the United States and in many parts of the world. In five volumes under the rubric "Children of Crisis," he has encouraged the young to express themselves, called attention to their inner lives and made readers realize that children deserve equal consideration in society. He's on the side of the angels.</p><p>Early in his new book, Dr. Coles offers the case of an unruly 8-year-old girl he treated for two years in the 1950's at Children's Hospital in Boston. The girl, who was "utterly accepting of the Catholic Church," said that she had "bad habits" but that "the church saves me." The author searched for an explanation.</p>                </div>

                    <p>He learned that this devout youngster had seen the movie "Song of Bernadette," the film about Bernadette of Lourdes, a 19th-century French teen-age peasant whose claims of seeing visions of the Virgin Mary were met with skepticism but who was canonized in 1933. She wanted to talk about it. She accused Dr. Coles of being interested only in her problems and not her religion and told him to encourage her to discuss the movie's personal meaning. Finally, she said, "I'd like to be like Bernadette was in the movie, but you don't believe me!"</p><p>As in many of the case histories in "The Spiritual Life of Children," Dr. Coles uses this one to examine his own feelings and responses. The case of the 8-year-old does not lead to any particular conclusion about the roots of her spirituality other than the obvious influence of her devout family and her desire to emulate a heroine. A few years later, Dr. Coles recalled this white child from Boston when he was talking with black children in the South going through mobs to enter newly desegregated schools.</p><p>"At times I would still shy away from spiritual matters, try to keep those children conversing about familial or school tensions, about this or that city's progress or seeming demise, the result of serious racial turmoil. But at other moments I would listen (with increasing patience and finally respect) to these elementary schoolchildren as they let their minds soar to heaven, descend to hell, meet with saints and sinners." He adds that these children told him they felt God was smiling down upon them as they walked through the crowd of angry whites calling them names.</p><p>What inspires children to turn to religion? Dr. Coles and his wife and sons, serving as interviewers in Northern Ireland, Poland, Nicaragua, South Africa, Brazil and in their native New England, found universal feelings about religion among children of different races and places. He says that accidents, illnesses and bad luck prompt reflection in children as they do in adults. Even for healthy children, he writes, the death of a grandparent or other person in the family circle has a powerful meaning.</p><p>In one of the most original passages in the book, Dr. Coles writes:"But less evident are the strategies boys and girls devise to accommodate a secular and familial morality, on the one hand, and the religious morality they hear espoused in churches, mosques, synagogues. The task for those boys and girls is to weave together a particular version of a morality both personal and yet tied to a religious tradition, and then (the essence of the spiritual life) ponder their moral successes and failures and, consequently, their prospects as human beings who will someday die."</p><p>In "The Spiritual Life of Children," there is a strong moral underpinning in the adult authorities who have inspired the author: Anna Freud, Dorothy Day, Erik H. Erikson, Reinhold Niebuhr. Their comments, sprinkled through the book, help to clarify some of the opaque remarks that are made by the young children. All these role models, in their own ways, called for the need to listen instead of to lecture, to teach by example, a theme that runs throughout the book.</p><p>Of Dorothy Day, a liberal Catholic advocate of workers and the poor, Dr.  Coles writes that she "often pointed out to me that at the very start of the Bible -- and, indeed, of the world as the Bible presents its beginnings -- there was a mixture of thought and action, of word and deed, of symbol and substance. God spoke, said, 'Let there be light,' but He also acted, breathed life into the dust."</p><p>Dr. Coles concludes, "And so it goes to this day for children, too, as they hustle their way through space and time, doing and doing and doing, but also stopping and asking and wondering, and in their own fashion declaring and affirming."</p><p>Photo: Robert Coles</p>                </div>
