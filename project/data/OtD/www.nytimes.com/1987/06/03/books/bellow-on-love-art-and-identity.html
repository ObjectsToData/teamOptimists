                    <p>In Saul Bellow's new novel, ''More Die of Heartbreak,'' a botanist is asked by a reporter about the problems of radiation levels, dioxin and harmful wastes. ''It's terribly serious, of course,'' the botanist says, ''but I think more people die of heartbreak than of radiation.''</p><p>''I think that's true,'' Mr. Bellow said, sitting in the lobby of a quiet midtown hotel. Yet the botanist is ridiculed in the press for what he says, and in the novel Mr. Bellow presents the statement in a humorous way.</p><p>''Well, I learned from reading George Bernard Shaw years ago,'' he said, ''that you can get away with murder as long as you can make people laugh.''</p><p>''One of the subjects of the book,'' he continued, ''is the difference between a fabricated person and a true person. All through the writing of this book I was reading a lot of Nietzsche, and he makes some curious statements. He says that in a free society people are more free to make themselves up. He says that in older, more stable societies people didn't mind being a part of the general plan of the society, that they were governed by some kind of architectural faith and that they took their proper places in life, sometimes as an inconspicuous part of the whole structure, but that in a modern society people are released from all such necessities, and he mentions America particularly. They make themselves up. They leave nature and go toward art, is the way Nietzsche puts it. Well, the art is often not very good. It starts out with the project of inventing yourself gloriously and it ends up with a kind of fizzing out of the whole impulse.'' 'Access to Your Own Soul'</p>                </div>

                    <p>It all goes by a blueprint, Mr. Bellow said. ''For a while I was a devoted reader of Playboy. Not for sexual reasons - it didn't do much for me in that department - but you could see that Playboy existed in order to advise young people on the make how to dress, what sort of apartment to have, how to furnish, where to dine, how to make a salad dressing, how to get your hair cut, how to entertain, how to date. The magazine was a source of instruction to people who have come up very quickly and haven't had time to look into these matters, which they needed for a successful corporate career or just for getting by socially, or whatever. So they go by a lot of slogans, which have been inculcated into them, and what happens to the true person? Culture means having access to your own soul. That's a very old-fashioned notion, but I think a great many people understand it.''</p><p>The novel concerns the relationship between the botanist, Benn Crader, and his nephew, Kenneth, as well as their many problems with their wives, lovers and ex-lovers. It's clear in the book that Mr. Bellow feels that there are many difficulties in contemporary relations between men and women.</p><p>''At the beginning of modern times, women were promised love, as it were,'' he said. ''They were told, you're going to be free, you're going to be well, you're going to love and be loved, and this will help you to weather the difficulties of life. This is Rousseau's plan - these free societies based on enlightened principles were not going to work unless people were trained in love, educated for it. 'Wretchedness'</p><p>''And that was the whole subject of the novel for a couple of centuries, that people were in love, either faithful or unfaithful, and in the French novel I suppose adultery was the principal subject for a long time. And in America, as one should have expected, this was done on a big scale, through sentiment, romantic books, Tin Pan Alley, early movies and all the rest. Well, then there was a sort of feminine discovery that this was bunk, that you couldn't take it from your ma that if you're a good girl you're going to be lucky, Mr. Right will come along, you'll be happy, your husband will love you, you'll love him, you'll be a happy family.</p><p>''Suddenly this was snatched away, and it was replaced by the sexual revolution, which has a very different foundation - namely, that you were a creature, you were an animal, you had certain creaturely needs, sex was one of them, you have a right to gratify these for the sake of your health, your well-being, your complexion, your personality, or whatnot else. All right, so people gave this a fling. Well, no human being takes another human being all that seriously any more, and when you have that happening at the very core of a society, then you're looking at a lot of trouble, a great deal of wretchedness, because something in human nature demands a constancy of connection, emotional constancy. There's a secret voice in us which says, 'No, this is bad; this is wrong. I'm alone again, once more cast into outer darkness.' '' The Beleaguered Artist</p><p>It is now a little more than 10 years since Mr. Bellow, who will be 72 years old next month, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. How has it affected his career? ''First of all,'' he said, ''I didn't start out to be successful. I started out to write. I didn't start scribbling at the age of 16 to win a prize. I would have been satisfied with much less. I didn't invent America's celebrity machinery, either, and I stay away from it as much as I can. In between books I have nothing at all to do with it.''</p><p>Mr. Bellow said he writes ''because this is my path into life. I don't know what I am without it. It's inconceivable for me to picture myself without it. I don't have a full explanation for it, any more than birds do for bird song.''</p><p>The artist in our society, though, is beleaguered, he said. In the novel, Kenneth says that the humanities -poetry, philosophy, painting - are ''the nursery games of humankind, which had to be left behind when the age of science began. The humanities would be called upon to choose a wallpaper for the crypt, as the end drew near.''</p><p>The artist's role, Mr. Bellow said, is one of resistance to these denaturing forces. ''William Blake is a wonderful guide to this,'' he said. ''First of all, you only know the truth of a poet or an artist when your heart rises up and says, 'Yes, yes, that's it, that's true. What he says is true. I've known it all along, only now it's clear to me because he has said it.' And the imagination to Blake is a divine power, and man is divine himself, insofar as he participates, as he enjoys the use of this power. It brings about a strength of personal vision. Not everybody sees the same world. Some people, when they see the sun in the sky, see something resembling a gold coin. Others see a chorus of angels crying 'Holy, holy, holy.' And as you see, so you are. That is a grade of human character - it's connected to the quality of perception of the external world.''</p><p>''When I wrote 'The Dean's December,' '' he said, ''I tried to say in that book that even the power to experience is taken from us by our lack of development in art, in culture, so that we don't know how to interpret experience. So if you ask people to explain why they are what they are, why they do what they do, they're on the moon when they try to explain it to you. I know that and you know that.''</p><p>But, Mr. Bellow said, there is still hope. ''Our humanity is in so many ways intact. It's absolutely impossible for it to be destroyed in just one phase of human development. How do we know that? Well, ordinary people can still see 'King Lear' and weep.''</p><p>Photo of Saul Bellow (Thomas Victor)</p>                </div>
