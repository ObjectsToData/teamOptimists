                    <p>ON a recent evening Margaret Gibson, a poet, brought ''Photographs, Footnotes, and the Foul Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart'' - a talk on the sources she used for her latest book - to an audience at Otis Library in Norwich. Earlier that day, she discussed poetry with students in a writing class at Mohegan Community College, also in Norwich.</p><p>Ms. Gibson's library presentation and her classroom talk were among the activities included in her schedule as writer-in-residence at Mohegan, which ended Saturday. Since late February, Ms. Gibson and four other writers have spent one- or two-week residencies at four community colleges around the state. Nicholas Rinaldi, a poet and novelist, will be at Quinebaug Community College in Danielson tomorrow to begin the last residency of the series.</p><p>The series is sponsored by the Connecticut Commission on the Arts, with assistance from the National Endowment for the Arts. It is part of the commission's campaign ''to introduce Connecticut writers to the public,'' said Linda Dente, the commission's program manager.</p><p>Two years ago, the commission assembled a roster of Connecticut writers, including poets and novelists. Most have had their works published and several have received literary awards. But, said Ms. Dente, most are not widely known. ''We want to change that,'' she said.</p>                </div>

                    <p>During its first year of promoting the writers, the commission sponsored readings and workshops by several of them at schools and libraries. Last year, the commission distributed books by the writers to 200 public libraries and sponsored 16 series of readings by some of the poets. The commission introduced the residencies this year.</p><p>The residencies were ''designed to put writers in contact with people in an intimate way,'' said Ms. Gibson, who lives in Preston and whose most recent book of poetry is ''Memories of the Future: The Daybooks of Tina Modotti.'' At the Otis library, she described how she used the life and work of Ms. Modotti, a photographer and political activist in the 1920's and 1930's, in that book, and how she took from what William Butler Yeats called ''the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.''</p><p>All the residencies have included public programs in libraries as well as classes and workshops at the community colleges. Students, teachers, aspiring authors and others have turned out to meet the writers-in-residence and hear them read their own work, to listen to lectures on literature and participate in often lively discussions. Ms. Gibson said that those in one evening discussion at Mohegan wanted to continue all night and then go out for breakfast.</p><p>For some, listening to and working with the program's writers has provided a chance to enjoy something already close to their hearts. ''I love poetry,'' said Rae Frechette of New London at Ms. Gibson's presentation at the Otis Library. ''I love to hear it read, and to have the writer read it makes it come alive.''</p><p>Others have found valuable assistance. ''I think it's very exciting, if you're interested in becoming a writer, to have somebody come in and say 'I've been through this and I did it,' and show you a bit of the writing process,'' said Ann deKay, a Mohegan student and aspiring writer. There are things to be learned from writers, she added, ''that you can't get from books.''</p><p>Still others have encountered entirely new ideas and experiences. ''Most of my students had never met a poet and were sort of surprised to find that that could be someone's identity,'' said Sue Ellen Thompson, who was writer-in-residence at Northwestern Community College in Winsted last winter. Ms. Thompson, who lives in Mystic, received the 1986 Morse Poetry Prize for a book of poems, ''This Body of Silk.''</p><p>Rennie McQuilkin, a poet from Simsbury, recalled the reactions of some students and other listeners at the programs he gave during his residency in early April at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport. ''They were surprised that poetry is alive, that it's a dramatic art, that it's energetic, gutsy and forceful,'' said Mr. McQuilkin, whose work has appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, the Yale Review, Yankee and other magazines. ''Their vision of poetry was of something difficult, esoteric and dry.''</p><p>The writers said they enjoyed the mix of students they found in the community college classrooms.</p><p>''My students ranged from 18-year-olds to women in their 50's and 60's,'' said Ms. Thompson, who said that the women who had returned to school, often after raising families, were among ''the most interested, and interesting.''</p><p>Mr. McQuilking said: ''I liked teaching adults. I liked the diverse backgrounds, and the people who really had a stake in their learning.''</p><p>Ms. Gibson noted that after one of her classes, in which she read a poem by Gerald Stern referring to Germany and Poland in 1945, a gray-haired student came up to tell her how he had helped to liberate inmates at a concentration camp at the end of World War II.</p><p>Several writers-in-residence held programs for particular groups from outside the colleges. Ms. Thompson, for instance, gave a workshop for local elementary and high school teachers. ''I talked with them about how they might go about teaching their students how to write,'' said Ms. Thompson. She also gave a poetry workshop for ''very bright, enthusiastic'' fourth graders who, she learned later, had all suffered traumatic experiences.</p><p>College administrators said the residencies have worked out very well. ''There's no substitute for contact between students and a writer,'' said James Coleman, a Mohegan professor whose clases Ms. Gibson visited. ''There's an impact, person to person.'' Several administrators noted that because the writers helped plan their residencies and because they had a week or two of events, not just a single reading or lecture, they could offer variety and depth. ''You could develop a series of programs and interactions that could keep building,'' said Charles Wall, dean of academic affairs at Northwestern. The program ''enabled us to do things with the students and with the community,'' said Robert Isaacs, a professor of English at Housatonic.</p><p>Other participants in the writer-in-residence program so far were Clymenza Hawkins of Hartford, who was at Housatonic in February, and Brendan Galvin of Durham, who was recently at Manchester Community College. Ms. Hawkins is the author of an unpublished novel, ''Solitary Landscapes.'' Mr. Galvin's poetry has been published in The New Yorker and The Atlantic.</p><p>Mr. Rinaldi, whose published works include several books of poetry and also a novel, ''Silent Bridge,'' will be at Quinebaug from April 26 through May 8. ''There will be poetry and fiction readings, and I'm expecting to do workshops with the students and look at their work,'' said Mr. Rinaldi.</p><p>''We want to emhasize his being available to the community,'' said Alice Letteney, director of development at Quinebaug. Information on public programs in which Mr. Rinaldi will participate, including a humanities seminar, is available from the college, 774-1160.</p><p>The commission members hope to continue placing Connecticut writers at community colleges. ''Maybe next year we'll aim for some long-term residencies that cross academic fields,'' said Ms. Dente. Some colleges may plan short, one-credit courses in a visiting writer's work, she added.</p><p>Photo of Margaret Gibson lecturing at Otis Library of Mohegan Community College (NYT/Bill Burkhart)</p>                </div>
