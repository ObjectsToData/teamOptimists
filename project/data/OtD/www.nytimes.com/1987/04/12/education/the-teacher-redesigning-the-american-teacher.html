                    <p>CATHY HAEUSLER is a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who is studying to become a teacher but often feels as if she has been asked to repeat elementary school. ''Everything I do seems to revolve around cutting things out and hanging them on the wall,'' she said.</p><p>In Music in the Elementary Grades, for instance, Miss Haeusler and her classmates work on topics like finding middle C on the piano. ''A lot of people can't find middle C,'' she said. ''so we spent a few hours last week just doing that.'' In science one day she and her fellow students were each given a glass of 7-Up and some raisins and asked to record what happened when the raisins were dropped into it. ''The bubbles from the 7-Up condense on the raisin and raise it to the top of the glass,'' Miss Haeusler recalled. ''Then the bubbles pop, the raisin sinks and the whole thing happens again.''</p><p>The purpose of such experiments is to help future teachers recreate for themselves the kinds of experiences their students will have, but Miss Haeusler thinks there must be better ways to prepare her for her future career. ''It really seems kind of pointless to get up at 8 A.M. to spend two hours dropping raisins into 7-Up,'' she said. ''They could have told us the same thing, or even demonstrated the project, and saved half the time.''</p><p>Complaints about what is often called the ''Mickey Mouse'' nature of many education courses are longstanding, especially from those who endured them and even from school administrators. ''When you ask a good teacher where did you learn all those marvelous things, no one ever says it was during their preservice education,'' said Willis D. Hawley, dean of Peabody College at Vanderbilt University.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Suddenly, however, these complaints are being taken seriously. Growing national anxiety about the quality of American primary and high schools, coupled with the prospect of a major teacher shortage in the mid-1990's, has turned the quality of teacher training into a major educational and political issue.</p><p>Nearly 100 research universities, from the University of Connecticut to Stanford in California, have banded together to try to upgrade the quality and prestige of teacher education, partly by forcing scores of undergraduate colleges out of the teacher-training business. State politicians across the nation have been scurrying to raise standards for certifying new teachers, while the Carnegie Corporation of New York, a foundation with a longstanding interest in education reform, has embarked on a $50 million effort to set up the first nationwide certification system.</p><p>While just about everyone agrees something must be done about course quality, the consensus stops there. Debates have sprung up over issues ranging from whether four years is enough for training a teacher to whether states should open a ''back door'' for talented graduates of liberal-arts colleges who want to teach but missed out on education courses. The issue of how to attract and train teachers cannot be separated from controversies about working conditions and whether teaching should be considered a ''profession'' with its own body of knowledge.</p><p>Underlying all these issues is the fundamental problem reflected in Miss Haeusler's experience: Very little is known about how children learn. Still less is known about how to teach them effectively, and even less is known about how to teach teachers.</p><p>''We don't know what makes an effective teacher,'' said Marshall S. Smith, dean of the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University. ''We know who are terrible teachers. We have a set of judgments based on common sense, and we've learned a few things, like it's best to have hands-on manipulation of science materials. But we haven't put what we do know into a package. Instead, we move students through the same old system, give them a weak test and let them go.''  A 19th-Century Job Description</p><p>The production of elementary and high school teachers has long been a major enterprise, despite the substantial decline in the number of education graduates since 1973. Nearly 100,000 new teachers - 1 in every 10 college graduates - enter the field yearly. There are more than 1,200 colleges with education programs, from tiny liberal-arts colleges that produce only a handful to California State University at Los Angeles, which last year turned out 2,215 graduates ready for certification. ''Teacher education has been a real cash cow for a lot of universities,'' observed Judith Lanier, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State.</p><p>Yet despite its national importance, teaching has always been marked by low pay and equally low status. In the late 19th century, when the ideal of public education expanded in the United States, there were not enough well-educated people to teach everyone. The job also required a full-time commitment, so public schools were built around a work force of young, single females, many of whom were only a few chapters ahead of their students and all of whom were expected to leave when they married. A few single women made it a career, and most men who entered the field as a profession quickly became principals. Since single women had relatively few vocational options, schools did not have to pay them much. Teacher education was also conceived of as little more than the passing on of simple, applicable formulas. Since virtually all the professional knowledge lay with supervisors, schools were run in a rigid, top-down fashion.</p>                </div>
