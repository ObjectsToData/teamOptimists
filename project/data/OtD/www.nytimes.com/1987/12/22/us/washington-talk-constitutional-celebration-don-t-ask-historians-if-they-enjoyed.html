                    <p>Like the young republic whose founding it commemorates, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution is coming under attack.</p><p>A number of leading historians complain that the effort focused on public relations extravaganzas at the expense of serious scholarship on works of lasting value. Others say former Chief Justice Warren Burger, the chairman, has run the commission with an iron hand and convened secret meetings that at least one critic considers more appropriate to the Central Intelligence Agency than to a commemoration of the foundation of American liberty.</p><p>Mr. Burger, called ''the chief'' by panel members and staff, acknowledges what he calls the historians' ''irritation.'' He says he focused on raising the public's awareness and on a national history and civics lesson that he says will ultimately gain a wider audience for scholarly works. He noted that other Government agencies financed scholarly studies of the Constitution. 'To Get the Job Done'</p><p>Mr. Burger also said he had run a tight ship and insisted on secret meetings so as ''to get the job done.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The commission was formed in 1985, directed by Congress to ''harmonize and balance the important goals of ceremony and celebration with the equally important goals of scholarship and education.''</p><p>The commission has spent $15 million of $25 million appropriated. ''The chief has been very frugal,'' said one commission member, Lynne Cheney, who is chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. An additional $15 million is pending in the current appropriation bill.</p><p>It spent $3 million on salaries; $2.7 million on instructional material and contests for high school students; $2 million on advertising; $600,000 on projects relating to a huge celebration in Philadelphia Sept. 17; $500,000 on pocket Constitutions; $400,000 on calendars; $200,000 for a ''teach-in,'' and lesser amounts on a re-enactment of the Constitutional Convention, souvenirs, tree plantings and reprints. Among other activities, commission members themselves posed with Mickey Mouse at Disney World.</p><p>''They've given us bread and circuses, instead of something historically significant,'' said Louis R. Harlan, Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Maryland, a Pulitzer-prize winning historian who is president-elect of the American Historical Association.</p><p>''The parades and the fireworks have faded into history along with the 100,000 red, white and blue balloons released from the West Front of the Capitol,'' he said. ''Across America there were essay contests, lectures, town meetings, 10-K runs, barbecues, tree plantings, street-namings, band contests, half-time ceremonies, bell-ringings, issuance of commemorative coins and stamps and distribution of millions of pocket-sized copies of the Constitution itself.''</p><p>But, in Mr. Harlan's view, the panel ''has not lived up to the mandate of Congress that it provide for scholarship, the one thing that will endure and be of use to future generations.''</p><p>He noted that officials in charge of a 1932 bicentennial celebration of George Washington's birth also sponsored extravaganzas and brought about the George Washington quarter still in use. ''But as their more enduring legacy, they launched a major scholarly edition of the papers of George Washington,'' he said.</p><p>Similarly, Michael Kammen, professor of American history and culture at Cornell University, said, ''The record of the commission with respect to scholarship is rather poor.''</p><p>''I know of quite a number of individuals and groups looking at universities who wanted to put on a number of conferences, who sought funds from the Bicentennial Commission, and who were not only turned down, but given the back of the hand.''</p><p>''Historians are not pleased,'' he said. ''They are critical. But I don't think they expected very much.''</p><p>Mr. Burger said he regarded the historians as special pleaders. ''They're putting the cart before the horse,'' he said. ''First we had to get people's attention or they wouldn't read any of the things that the scholars would like to write.''</p><p>Mr. Burger pointed to a five-foot-long coffee table laden with recently published books and pamphlets. The commission was not in a position to underwrite these projects, he said, but served as a catalyst to spur their publication and provided the commission's imprimatur, if not funds.</p><p>Mr. Burger also noted that Congress instructed the commission to spend $2.7 million on grants for programs aimed at elementary or secondary school students. But critics think the commission was also expected to finance scholarly projects, if only to assure that school materials were based on a firm foundation.</p><p>Government agencies including the National Archives and the Departments of Interior, Commerce, Education, Defense, Justice, Treasury, Energy and Agriculture, as well as Congress and the judiciary have sponsored scholarly research on the Constitution. The National Endowment for the Humanities alone has spent $22.5 million.</p><p>Some historians and staff members say they resent what they consider Mr. Burger's authoritatarian style. For example, he prohibited all but official contacts with news reporters.</p><p>''There's no question who's in charge,'' Mrs. Cheney said. ''But that doesn't mean that we don't disagree with him from time to time.'' In one such disagreement, the commission members overrode Mr. Burger's objections and provided $600,000 for projects undertaken in connection with the Philadelphia celebration.</p><p>Nevertheless, his leadership seems to have produced accord among widely diverse members. ''The two people who keep the meetings going, and usually come up with a motion that one introduces and the other seconds, are Phyllis Schlafly and Ted Kennedy,'' said Representative Lindy Boggs, a Louisiana Democrat who is a member. Mrs. Schlafly is a leading conservative, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy is a liberal Democrat.</p><p>Mr. Burger acknowledged that he been a disciplinarian. ''We had to,'' he said, referring to himself. ''We only had a short time. We had a job to do, a marketing job, essentially.'' Eclipsed by Miss Liberty</p><p>The commission had barely two years to organize the celebration. It was initially eclipsed by preparations for the 1986 centennial of the Statue of Liberty, which ''pre-empted the whole stage, for a while,'' Mr. Burger said. ''It was a waste of time talking to anybody about the Constitution.''</p><p>He also acknowledged that he insisted on closed meetings. Noting that the Constitutional Convention itself was conducted in secret, Mr. Burger said, ''People could express their point of view in the morning, and change their mind in the afternoon or the next day.''</p><p>But Alan Morrison, a public interest lawyer who tried to force the panel to open its meetings, said, ''Whatever the law is, we ought not have a commission celebrating the Constitution operating as the C.I.A.''</p><p>The life of the commission has been extended to commemorate other bicentennials: in 1988, Congress; in 1989, the executive; in 1990, the judiciary, and in 1991, the Bill of Rights. Mr. Burger said he had no plans to change the way the panel operates.</p><p>Photos of bicentennial celebration and of historians who criticezed it (AP)</p>                </div>
