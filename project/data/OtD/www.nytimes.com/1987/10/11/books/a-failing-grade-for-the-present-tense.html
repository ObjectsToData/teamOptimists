                    <p>PAULINE experienced many perils, but none to compare with the perils of the present tense. She was tied to tracks, left to teeter on window ledges, allowed to hang from cliffs by the lace in her pantaloons. Yet in the week while we waited for her bloomers to rip or the train to come, time held its breath as we held ours -in serial suspension; that is, we calmly ignored the pause in her plight as we went about our business, placing our modest cares in a parenthetical phrase; because, when the lace on her undies relaxed at last, when the train's hoot grew cruelly closer, or when Pauline's delicate balance seemed to have slipped beyond refooting, then her peril continued as if there had never been an interruption, not a shiver was missing, or a screech from a scream; and, in order to reassure us of this, the second episode would reprise the conclusion of the first, and so on, right through the fearful 15.</p><p>Later I would be taught to wonder - about the present, but not about Pauline - whether anything might have taken place between one tick and its following tock of which we were unaware (the fast fiddling of a group of most minute insects, for in-stance), or whether there might be cracks in events we didn't spot because they were passing by too quickly. Was the present a row of solid moments like a line of baby blocks (in which case there might be some infantile unevenness in the arrangement), or was it an uninterruptible whisssh (whereupon we had to wonder what our measurements meant - our eras, milliseconds, decades - what our divisions did)?</p><p>Suppose I were about to move my queen's knight, and, while my hand hovered above the head which the whole horse was, the frame froze, and my opponent and I rushed away in that infinitesimal interval for a set of tennis at fast forward, only to return in less time than it takes to tell: I to lift my knight from its square, my foe to wonder why and where - what then? Take this thought a little further. While one line of time is dit-dotting along, maybe others are passing at right angles between the dits like hair through a comb? How could one guess how huge the hiccup in Being was: perhaps, instead of a quick set of tennis, there was a long fall of empire, like that of Rome? We were taught to ask such questions, and we were taught not to smile when we did so, but to look profoundly concerned and immeasurably intense. Now we put our VCR's on pause and think no more about it. But what if God put us on pause while He spooned up a dish of Heavenly Hash? . . . and slowly dribbled over it a sweet excess of chocolate sauce?</p><p>The perils of the present tense are neither an orchestrated series of difficult moments like those which beset poor Pauline (the sort of assembled shots that make up ''film time''), nor the normal passage of experience from nonce to nonce (which adds up to ''life time,'' if we're lucky); it is the invention on the page of connections in language which denote, describe and relate events (verbal occurrences that we can call ''word time''); and, within which, the only lapse that can count as a crime is a lapse of grammar. Yet its perils are real; rescues are infrequent (unlike the case of plucky Pauline, who is always saved from the saw just ahead of the nick); and those that are reluctantly attempted are generally botched. The present tense is a parched and barren country. In the past, writers rarely went there.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Why do I warn you about the perils of the present tense? Because there is a lot of it going around. What was once a rather rare disease has become an epidemic. In conjunction with the first person, in collusion with the declarative mode, in company with stammery elisions and verbal reticence - each often illnesses in their own right - it has become that major social and artistic malaise called minimalism, itself a misnomer. This is not the minimalism of Gertrude Stein and Samuel Beckett, or of Anton Webern and Kasimir Malevich, in which a few obsessively selected means are squeezed into a mighty More - that more, as Mies van der Rohe said, which is the large result of less. This is rather the less, less yields. This is modesty taken down a peg. Here we have the simple without the pretensions of simplicity, plainness without the pressures of an Amish or a Shaker ethic.</p><p>HOW does it happen that I have been alerted to this outbreak of the present tense, when, perhaps, you haven't? Not long ago I was asked to select stories by new writers for an anthology, and my initial survey of the field, taking me geologically about 15 years deep, uncovered the condition. Further researches at writing schools, the principal source of the contamination, underlined the seriousness of the situation and the extent of its ramifications. (I wrote ''underlined'' just now - quite wrong, it dates me - ''highlighted'' is the right term.) There were writing programs in a few universities before World War II, but it was only after that conflict that they began to multiply and flourish. They've been with us, roughly, 30 years, or a generation, as it is often measured. We are now experiencing the cumulative effects of their operations. You may have noticed the plague of school-styled poets with which our pages have been afflicted, and taken some account of the no-account magazines that exist in order to publish them. In addition, thousands of short-story readers and writers have been released like fingerlings into the thin mainstream of serious prose.</p>                </div>
