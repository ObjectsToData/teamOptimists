                    <p>IN 1965, when Congress was drafting legislation to create Medicare, the president of the American Medical Association testified against it, warning that there was ''no totally effective method'' to control its cost. Events bore out his warning: Despite many ingenious efforts to restrain the cost of the program, Medicare outlays continue to surge upward, raising serious questions about how the nation will pay for the health care that its elderly citizens want and need in the future. Medicare spending has climbed from $3.4 billion in 1967 to $75.9 billion in 1986, but on the average the elderly still pay a quarter of their medical expenses from their own pockets.</p><p>Doctors who initially fought the program as a harbinger of socialized medicine have become its staunch defenders; physician services became a major factor in the growth of total Medicare spending. An expert advisory commission reported last spring that Government payments to doctors had risen by an average of 18 percent a year since the mid-1970's, to $19 billion last year. Federal officials cited those costs, along with such factors as the 2 percent annual increase in the Medicare population, in announcing last week that they wanted to raise the premiums for 31 million elderly and disabled people by 38.5 percent.</p><p>The increase, the largest in the history of the program, would raise the monthly premium to $24.80 from $17.90, so beneficiaries would have to pay a total of $297.60 a year - a significant sum for many elderly people. According to the Census Bureau, the median income of people 65 years old and over was $8,154 last year, $11,544 for men and $6,425 for women. Representative Claude Pepper, a Florida Democrat and hero to the elderly, introduced a bill last week that would limit the percentage of increase in Medicare premiums to the percentage of increase in Social Security cash benefits. With the latter projected at 4.2 percent next year, Medicare premiums would increase by less than $1 a month under Mr. Pepper's bill.</p><p>The Administration says a much bigger increase is needed just to continue Medicare in its current form. But Congress is also considering a major expansion of Medicare to help pay the costs of catastrophic illnesses. The new benefits would be financed with additional premiums, graduated according to income. The extra premiums could be as large as $580 a year under the House bill and $848 a year under the Senate version.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. William L. Roper, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said, ''The very rapid and somewhat unexpected rise in the Medicare premium for 1988 should cause members of Congress to wonder about the wisdom'' of enacting a catastrophic-care program that goes far beyond President Reagan's recommendations. Eric Shulman, a lobbyist for the National Council of Senior Citizens, said the Administration's announcement of a $24.80 premium was ''clearly intended to put pressure on Congress to strip the catastrophic bill of many of its most important benefits, such as Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.''</p><p>The debate dramatizes one of the perils of the legislative process, encoded in the maxim, ''The perfect is the enemy of the good.'' Thus, it is suggested, by trying to add too many benefits to the catastrophic insurance program, the sponsors may jeopardize the entire bill.</p><p>The premium increase, though surprising to many people, is deeply rooted in the history of Medicare. The program's founders wanted to give doctors an incentive to participate, so the 1965 law assured them they would be paid their ''usual and customary fees,'' as long as the fees were also ''reasonable.'' Allen J. Matusow, dean of humanities at Rice University, said this formula virtually guaranteed ''galloping medical price inflation.'' Looking at Quantity of Services</p><p>In the early years of the program, premiums covered about half of the cost of Part B of Medicare, which helps pay for doctors' services, outpatient hospital care and home health care; now premiums are set at the level needed to cover 25 percent of anticipated Part B costs.</p><p>John C. Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said the premium increase showed the need for ''dramatic changes in the way we pay for physician services.'' To date, the Government has regulated doctors' fees, but has not controlled the quantity of services they provide. While such controls could have a much more direct effect on doctors' incomes, they would also put the Government much more deeply in the position of telling doctors how they should practice medicine.</p><p>Doctors resent implications that their fees are excessive. Dr. L. Barry Ultan, chief of cardiology at the Helene Fuld Medical Center in Trenton, N.J., said, ''It is offensive to many doctors who are working long hours to have politicians suggest that we are gouging patients.'' In his own specialty, for instance, Dr. Ultan said, the Government itself requires doctors to perform certain procedures before discharging heart attack victims from the hospital. Those tests may add to the cost of care, but ''they also prolong lives, they are proven life-savers,'' he said.</p><p>The most significant expansion of Medicare came in 1972, when Congress extended coverage to disabled people under 65 and to people with chronic kidney disease who needed dialysis or a kidney transplant. Robert M. Ball, the Commissioner of Social Security from 1962 to 1973, said coverage of kidney patients was ''rushed through on a wave of emotion'' after victims spoke at a Congressional hearing. ''It was appealing because the kidney patients were dying and we knew how to save their lives,'' said Mr. Ball, describing a quandary that persists for policy-makers. ''But the costs have gone through the roof.''</p><p>Photo of doctor and patient (Black Star/Anthony Suau); graph of total health care spending showing premiums paid by beneficiaries and general Government revenues (Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services)</p>                </div>
