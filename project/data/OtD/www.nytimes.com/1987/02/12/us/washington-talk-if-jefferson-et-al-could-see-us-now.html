                    <p>Forrest McDonald is a conservative Republican who says he is ill at ease in Washington, even the Washington of Ronald Reagan. But he is not ill at ease talking about the Constitution and the Federal Government that has evolved from it. He is an expert on that subject.</p><p>Mr. McDonald, a University of Alabama history professor, was recently chosen by the National Endowment for the Humanities as this year's Jefferson Lecturer, partly in tribute to the 200th anniversary of the Constitution this year.</p><p>The nation's highest honor in the humanities, the designation carries a $10,000 stipend and gives the recipient a chance to expound on his thoughts by giving a lecture in Washington.</p><p>Basically, Mr. McDonald holds a dim view of modern-day Government. And he believes the Founding Fathers would share his concern. If they could see how things are working today, he thinks they would say, ''Oh my God, what have we wrought!''

                    <p>''The Government of the United States interferes on a level in ordinary people's lives in a way they would have regarded as the most vicious form of tyranny imaginable,'' Mr. McDonald said in an interview. ''George the Third and all of his ministers could not have imagined a government this big, this intrusive and this powerful.''</p><p>At the same time, he thinks the Government's unwieldiness has brought the governing process to a ''dead stop.''</p><p>Ticking off governmental responsibilities set forth under the Constitution, he contends that the present Federal Government has ''lost its capacity to protect people in life, liberty and property, to provide for the common defense, or to promote the general welfare.''</p><p>Indeed, in view of the current budget crisis and trade deficit, he added, some critics might make a persuasive argument for a new system. But he is definitely not among them.</p><p>''We must keep it incompetent,'' he explained. ''If this Government were efficient, it could really exert its will, and I'd have to exert my Constitutional privilege as long as I could and flee -go somewhere else where the Government didn't work.''</p><p>As the 16th recipient of the prestigious humanities prize, Mr. McDonald joins an august group of winners including Leszek Kolakowski, Sidney Hook, Barbara Tuchman, Edward Shils, Saul Bellow, C. Vann Woodward, Erik H. Erikson and Robert Penn Warren.</p><p>The Texas-born scholar, now 60 years old, is on a one-year appointment to the College of William &amp; Mary, too far for his tastes from the farm near Tuscaloosa, Ala., where he and his wife, Ellen, raise flowers, study Latin and work on his books. Lecture Set for May</p><p>It was there that he prepared his Jefferson Lecture, which he will deliver before an invited audience in May. It will focus, he said, on a subject he explored in his most recent book, ''Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution,'' which made him one of three finalists for the Pulitzer prize in history last year.</p><p>He says the intellectual world of the Founding Fathers was ''a golden age'' that will not be seen again. ''There were giants on the earth in those days,'' he said.</p><p>The genius of the founders, he continued, was partly a result of the ''unique'' and ''highly civilized'' time in which they lived -a ''leisurely age,'' when life was slow, when interest in the classics had been revived and when people did not suffer ''the bombardment of the senses'' they must endure now.</p><p>There were so many exceptional minds in the land in those early days, he said, that the 55 men at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia could have been replaced several times over with others equally qualified, with the clear exception of George Washington, whom he describes as ''one of a kind.''</p><p>As a group, the framers understood that the absence of government was not freedom, but savagery, and they ''set out to create a system of ordered liberty,'' Mr. McDonald said. They worried about an ''excess of democracy,'' he added, and they ''wanted to curb the excess power of state governments.''</p><p>The Constitution that they devised granted power to the Fed-eral Government to curb state power, but also restricted the power of both. And because the framers were afraid of any concentration of power, he said, they made it ''almost impossible for Congress to express a unified will.''</p><p>''The system really worked beautifully until about 25 years ago,'' Mr. McDonald said, adding that the Government over which John F. Kennedy presided would have been recognizable to James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, unlike the situation today.</p><p>He attributes the change largely to the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson, ''who didn't have any sense of limitations,'' and who could play the Congress ''like a grand piano,'' leading the Government to ''explode into impossible areas.''</p><p>And while the Constitution was deliberately written to be ''flexible,'' so that it could live and breathe, he said, the Supreme Court has taken broad leaps from it, contributing to the unwarranted expansion of the Federal role. 'Totalitarian Temptation'</p><p>Mr. McDonald speaks of a ''totalitarian temptation of power,'' which means ''you object to power when it's exercised in ways you don't like and you get yourself into a position of power when you do.'' And he says that temptation affects even those true conservatives like Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, who has argued that judges must interpret the Constitution according to the original intent of the framers.</p><p>If Mr. Meese really believes that, Mr. McDonald said, it is ''philosophically inconsistent'' for him to adopt as missions of the Justice Department crusades against drugs and pornography. Those are ''police'' problems that belong more properly to the states to solve, Mr. McDonald maintained.</p><p>''The Administration could not possibly have fulfilled the expectations of all the conservative groups that brought it to power,'' he said, especially its promises to reduce the Government's functions. ''When you get some power, you want to exercise it,'' he added.</p><p>Mr. McDonald also criticizes what he sees as a trend in the nation to emphasize individual rights at the expense of society's as a whole. So when asked, in view of his heavy cigarette habit, whether he thought a state was within its rights to impose strict bans on smoking in public places, as New York is moving toward doing, Mr. McDonald unhappily confirmed that it was.</p><p>''If I'm in New York and the community says I can't smoke, I can move to New Jersey,'' he said.</p><p>''The greatest thing the Founding Fathers bequeathed to me is the Federal system. We have diversity, freedom to move, freedom of choice. When state law governs, you can go somewhere else. Under Federal law, there's no place to hide, no place to flee.''</p><p>Photo of Forrest McDonald</p>                </div>
