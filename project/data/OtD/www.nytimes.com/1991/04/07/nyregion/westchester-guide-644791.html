    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="BORGE IN PURCHASE     Victor Borge will give a solo performance Saturday at 6 P.M. in Theater A of the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York in Purchase. The 80-something virtuoso continues his international concert tours, amazing and amusing new audiences and old fans with his unique one-two combination of wit and musicianship.    Following the performance, cocktails and dinner will be served at 7:30 P.M., and a silent auction will be in progress throughout the evening with a Yamaha piano, a Saab, luxury dinners and fitness sessions as some of the items to be bid on.    The event will benefit the Fairfield Orchestra of Fairfield, Conn., founded 10 years ago by its conductor, Thomas Crawford. The 60-member ensemble has a special commitment to contemporary composers, commissioning one American work every year. Tickets are $20 for the concert and as much as $150 for the concert, dinner and a contribution. Call (203) 255-1160 for tickets and more information.  THE ARABIC WORLD     Dr. Moorhead Kennedy, a former hostage in Iran and now the executive director of the American Forum for Global Education, headquartered in Manhattan, will give four Sunday talks on the Arabic world at the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church, at 8 Greenacres Avenue in Scarsdale. Today's subject is &quot;The Roots of Islam,&quot; followed by &quot;Muslim/Western Views of the World: Islamic Law&quot; next Sunday.    &quot;Islam and the Development of Mideast Nationalism will be his topic on April 21, and the final lecture, April 28, is titled &quot;The Great Satan: Why Many Muslims Prefer Saddam Hussein to George Bush.&quot;   The one-hour programs begin at 9:30 A.M. and they are free. For more information, call 723-3311. THREE FRENCH FILMS     Three French films are to be shown at Reid Hall at Manhattanville College in Purchase on Thursdays at 7 P.M. They will be introduced by members of the French studies faculty and followed by open discussions.    A 1973 film, &quot;1789,&quot; by Ariane Mnouchkine traces the events leading up to the French Revolution and kicks off the series on Thursday. On April 18 the 1988 film &quot;Camille Claudel&quot; starring Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani deals with the relationship between the sculptor Auguste Rodin and the woman of the title. Louis Malle's &quot;Au Revoir les Enfants,&quot; to be shown April 25, was a 1987 release about a boy's traumatic experiences during the Nazi occupation of France. Admission is free. NANNIES ON THE TRAIL     With the increase in two-career families, Westchester has a growing number of au pairs, or nannies, imported from other countries and other parts of the United States to care for the children of working parents. The Greenburgh Nature Center has developed a program called &quot;Natural Nannies,&quot; in which the nannies and their young charges can participate.    In addition to supervised nature games, nature crafts, and storytelling about the area's history and environment, the center's 33 acres of gardens and trails will be toured, and its 130 live animals, reptiles and amphibians will be studied. The program is designed to give the nannies some insight into the region and some unique, shared experiences with the children.    Three sessions will be held from 1:30 to 2:30 P.M. Tuesdays beginning this week. The fee is $21 for a nanny and up to two children. The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue. Call 723-3470 to register or to obtain more information. CHILDREN AND SPIRIT     Dr. Robert Coles, research psychiatrist and professor of psychiatry and medical humanities at Harvard, is the final speaker in the President's Leadership Forum series at the State University of New York at Purchase. His talk, to be delivered at 8:30 A.M. Tuesday in Theater A of the Performing Arts Center, is &quot;The Spiritual Life of Children,&quot; which is also the title of his latest book (Little, Brown).    His multi-volume series, &quot;Children of Crisis&quot; expounds his theories about the effects of poverty and racial discrimination on children in the United States. Eschewing traditional academic methods of research, he has preferred to spend long hours with his subjects in one-to-one conversations.    He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Catherine MacArthur Foundation Fellowship Award and a National Educational Television award among others over the years.    Each year the leadership series presents lectures by individuals in the forefront of scientific, political, cultural and artistic thought, sponsored by a dozen major corporations based in Westchester and Fairfield Counties. Free tickets can be obtained by calling 251-6200. FLOORCLOTHS     Painted floorcloths, popular among affluent householders during the late 18th through the mid-19th century, cost between $1.37 and $2.25 a square foot, very costly for those days. They were an alternative to painting designs directly on the floor. Woven carpets were not walked on, but used as table and bed coverings.    Few antique floorcloths survive, but reproductions may be found by scouring shops on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Priced around $70 for one measuring up to 3- by 4-feet, they are made by individuals at home and sold on consignment.    An opportunity to learn floorcloth painting for fun or profit will be offered in a workshop at Boscobel conducted by Shirley Berman, a decorative arts teacher in Carmel, and a trustee of the Historical Society of Early American Decoration of the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan.    The workshop is scheduled from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, and each participant will make a 2-by-3-foot floorcloth. Ms. Berman will explain how to select the correct weight of canvas, its preparation with several coats of glue, gesso or water-based paint, the cutting of stencils for the designs, and painting with oils. Time will not permit completing the final step, applying four to six coats of polyurethane, which can be done at home.    &quot;With daily use, the floorcloths can last for many years,&quot; said Ms. Berman, &quot;cleaned with just a damp mop.&quot; Large sizes are made by stitching or glueing lengths of canvas together, with the seams becoming invisible after painting.    The fee is $140 and includes all materials. Boscobel, a restored 19th-century mansion, is on Route 9D in Garrison-on-Hudson, and in its foyer is a large painted floorcloth patterned with an 18th-century Greek key design. Call 265-3638 for more information or to enroll in the workshop. BLACKSMITHING CLASSES     Bill Fitzgerald, the resident master blacksmith at Muscoot Farm, will teach blacksmithing in five-hour sessions on the next three Saturdays. Students will choose their own projects and work under his individual supervision, after an orientation on basic techniques and safety precautions.    The farm is on Route 100 in Somers, of Exit 6 of I-684. The $65 fee includes all materials. Pre-registration is required. Call 232-7118. CHINESE DISCOVERIES     Three newly discovered neolithic cultures and a Bronze Age culture in Sichuan Province are among the archeological findings in China to be discussed by Dr. Jean M. James, a specialist in the art and archeology of early China at the University of Iowa.    &quot;New Surprises in a Decade of Discovery&quot; is the title of her talk, today at 7:30 P.M. in the Scarsdale Public Library on the Post Road. The talk is sponsored by the Westchester Society of the Archeological Institute of America.   Silks and artifacts from royal tombs dating from the fourth to the eighth century B.C. are among the treasures retrieved at the digs. Admission is by donation of $3.">

	data-description="BORGE IN PURCHASE     Victor Borge will give a solo performance Saturday at 6 P.M. in Theater A of the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York in Purchase. The 80-something virtuoso continues his international concert tours, amazing and amusing new audiences and old fans with his unique one-two combination of wit and musicianship.    Following the performance, cocktails and dinner will be served at 7:30 P.M., and a silent auction will be in progress throughout the evening with a Yamaha piano, a Saab, luxury dinners and fitness sessions as some of the items to be bid on.    The event will benefit the Fairfield Orchestra of Fairfield, Conn., founded 10 years ago by its conductor, Thomas Crawford. The 60-member ensemble has a special commitment to contemporary composers, commissioning one American work every year. Tickets are $20 for the concert and as much as $150 for the concert, dinner and a contribution. Call (203) 255-1160 for tickets and more information.  THE ARABIC WORLD     Dr. Moorhead Kennedy, a former hostage in Iran and now the executive director of the American Forum for Global Education, headquartered in Manhattan, will give four Sunday talks on the Arabic world at the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church, at 8 Greenacres Avenue in Scarsdale. Today's subject is "The Roots of Islam," followed by "Muslim/Western Views of the World: Islamic Law" next Sunday.    "Islam and the Development of Mideast Nationalism will be his topic on April 21, and the final lecture, April 28, is titled "The Great Satan: Why Many Muslims Prefer Saddam Hussein to George Bush."   The one-hour programs begin at 9:30 A.M. and they are free. For more information, call 723-3311. THREE FRENCH FILMS     Three French films are to be shown at Reid Hall at Manhattanville College in Purchase on Thursdays at 7 P.M. They will be introduced by members of the French studies faculty and followed by open discussions.    A 1973 film, "1789," by Ariane Mnouchkine traces the events leading up to the French Revolution and kicks off the series on Thursday. On April 18 the 1988 film "Camille Claudel" starring Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani deals with the relationship between the sculptor Auguste Rodin and the woman of the title. Louis Malle's "Au Revoir les Enfants," to be shown April 25, was a 1987 release about a boy's traumatic experiences during the Nazi occupation of France. Admission is free. NANNIES ON THE TRAIL     With the increase in two-career families, Westchester has a growing number of au pairs, or nannies, imported from other countries and other parts of the United States to care for the children of working parents. The Greenburgh Nature Center has developed a program called "Natural Nannies," in which the nannies and their young charges can participate.    In addition to supervised nature games, nature crafts, and storytelling about the area's history and environment, the center's 33 acres of gardens and trails will be toured, and its 130 live animals, reptiles and amphibians will be studied. The program is designed to give the nannies some insight into the region and some unique, shared experiences with the children.    Three sessions will be held from 1:30 to 2:30 P.M. Tuesdays beginning this week. The fee is $21 for a nanny and up to two children. The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue. Call 723-3470 to register or to obtain more information. CHILDREN AND SPIRIT     Dr. Robert Coles, research psychiatrist and professor of psychiatry and medical humanities at Harvard, is the final speaker in the President's Leadership Forum series at the State University of New York at Purchase. His talk, to be delivered at 8:30 A.M. Tuesday in Theater A of the Performing Arts Center, is "The Spiritual Life of Children," which is also the title of his latest book (Little, Brown).    His multi-volume series, "Children of Crisis" expounds his theories about the effects of poverty and racial discrimination on children in the United States. Eschewing traditional academic methods of research, he has preferred to spend long hours with his subjects in one-to-one conversations.    He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Catherine MacArthur Foundation Fellowship Award and a National Educational Television award among others over the years.    Each year the leadership series presents lectures by individuals in the forefront of scientific, political, cultural and artistic thought, sponsored by a dozen major corporations based in Westchester and Fairfield Counties. Free tickets can be obtained by calling 251-6200. FLOORCLOTHS     Painted floorcloths, popular among affluent householders during the late 18th through the mid-19th century, cost between $1.37 and $2.25 a square foot, very costly for those days. They were an alternative to painting designs directly on the floor. Woven carpets were not walked on, but used as table and bed coverings.    Few antique floorcloths survive, but reproductions may be found by scouring shops on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Priced around $70 for one measuring up to 3- by 4-feet, they are made by individuals at home and sold on consignment.    An opportunity to learn floorcloth painting for fun or profit will be offered in a workshop at Boscobel conducted by Shirley Berman, a decorative arts teacher in Carmel, and a trustee of the Historical Society of Early American Decoration of the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan.    The workshop is scheduled from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, and each participant will make a 2-by-3-foot floorcloth. Ms. Berman will explain how to select the correct weight of canvas, its preparation with several coats of glue, gesso or water-based paint, the cutting of stencils for the designs, and painting with oils. Time will not permit completing the final step, applying four to six coats of polyurethane, which can be done at home.    "With daily use, the floorcloths can last for many years," said Ms. Berman, "cleaned with just a damp mop." Large sizes are made by stitching or glueing lengths of canvas together, with the seams becoming invisible after painting.    The fee is $140 and includes all materials. Boscobel, a restored 19th-century mansion, is on Route 9D in Garrison-on-Hudson, and in its foyer is a large painted floorcloth patterned with an 18th-century Greek key design. Call 265-3638 for more information or to enroll in the workshop. BLACKSMITHING CLASSES     Bill Fitzgerald, the resident master blacksmith at Muscoot Farm, will teach blacksmithing in five-hour sessions on the next three Saturdays. Students will choose their own projects and work under his individual supervision, after an orientation on basic techniques and safety precautions.    The farm is on Route 100 in Somers, of Exit 6 of I-684. The $65 fee includes all materials. Pre-registration is required. Call 232-7118. CHINESE DISCOVERIES     Three newly discovered neolithic cultures and a Bronze Age culture in Sichuan Province are among the archeological findings in China to be discussed by Dr. Jean M. James, a specialist in the art and archeology of early China at the University of Iowa.    "New Surprises in a Decade of Discovery" is the title of her talk, today at 7:30 P.M. in the Scarsdale Public Library on the Post Road. The talk is sponsored by the Westchester Society of the Archeological Institute of America.   Silks and artifacts from royal tombs dating from the fourth to the eighth century B.C. are among the treasures retrieved at the digs. Admission is by donation of $3."></div>

Today's subject is "The Roots of Islam," followed by "Muslim/Western Views of the World: Islamic Law" next Sunday.</p><p>"Islam and the Development of Mideast Nationalism will be his topic on April 21, and the final lecture, April 28, is titled "The Great Satan: Why Many Muslims Prefer Saddam Hussein to George Bush."</p><p>The one-hour programs begin at 9:30 A.M. and they are free.

They will be introduced by members of the French studies faculty and followed by open discussions.</p><p>A 1973 film, "1789," by Ariane Mnouchkine traces the events leading up to the French Revolution and kicks off the series on Thursday. On April 18 the 1988 film "Camille Claudel" starring Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Adjani deals with the relationship between the sculptor Auguste Rodin and the woman of the title. Louis Malle's "Au Revoir les Enfants," to be shown April 25, was a 1987 release about a boy's traumatic experiences during the Nazi occupation of France. Admission is free. NANNIES ON THE TRAIL</p><p>With the increase in two-career families, Westchester has a growing number of au pairs, or nannies, imported from other countries and other parts of the United States to care for the children of working parents. The Greenburgh Nature Center has developed a program called "Natural Nannies," in which the nannies and their young charges can participate.</p><p>In addition to supervised nature games, nature crafts, and storytelling about the area's history and environment, the center's 33 acres of gardens and trails will be toured, and its 130 live animals, reptiles and amphibians will be studied. The program is designed to give the nannies some insight into the region and some unique, shared experiences with the children.</p><p>Three sessions will be held from 1:30 to 2:30 P.M. Tuesdays beginning this week. The fee is $21 for a nanny and up to two children. The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue. Call 723-3470 to register or to obtain more information. CHILDREN AND SPIRIT</p><p>Dr. Robert Coles, research psychiatrist and professor of psychiatry and medical humanities at Harvard, is the final speaker in the President's Leadership Forum series at the State University of New York at Purchase. His talk, to be delivered at 8:30 A.M. Tuesday in Theater A of the Performing Arts Center, is "The Spiritual Life of Children," which is also the title of his latest book (Little, Brown).</p><p>His multi-volume series, "Children of Crisis" expounds his theories about the effects of poverty and racial discrimination on children in the United States. Eschewing traditional academic methods of research, he has preferred to spend long hours with his subjects in one-to-one conversations.</p><p>He has won the Pulitzer Prize, the Catherine MacArthur Foundation Fellowship Award and a National Educational Television award among others over the years.</p><p>Each year the leadership series presents lectures by individuals in the forefront of scientific, political, cultural and artistic thought, sponsored by a dozen major corporations based in Westchester and Fairfield Counties. Free tickets can be obtained by calling 251-6200. FLOORCLOTHS</p><p>Painted floorcloths, popular among affluent householders during the late 18th through the mid-19th century, cost between $1.37 and $2.25 a square foot, very costly for those days. They were an alternative to painting designs directly on the floor. Woven carpets were not walked on, but used as table and bed coverings.</p><p>Few antique floorcloths survive, but reproductions may be found by scouring shops on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. Priced around $70 for one measuring up to 3- by 4-feet, they are made by individuals at home and sold on consignment.</p><p>An opportunity to learn floorcloth painting for fun or profit will be offered in a workshop at Boscobel conducted by Shirley Berman, a decorative arts teacher in Carmel, and a trustee of the Historical Society of Early American Decoration of the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan.</p><p>The workshop is scheduled from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, and each participant will make a 2-by-3-foot floorcloth. Ms. Berman will explain how to select the correct weight of canvas, its preparation with several coats of glue, gesso or water-based paint, the cutting of stencils for the designs, and painting with oils. Time will not permit completing the final step, applying four to six coats of polyurethane, which can be done at home.</p><p>"With daily use, the floorcloths can last for many years," said Ms. Berman, "cleaned with just a damp mop." Large sizes are made by stitching or glueing lengths of canvas together, with the seams becoming invisible after painting.</p><p>The fee is $140 and includes all materials. Boscobel, a restored 19th-century mansion, is on Route 9D in Garrison-on-Hudson, and in its foyer is a large painted floorcloth patterned with an 18th-century Greek key design. Call 265-3638 for more information or to enroll in the workshop. BLACKSMITHING CLASSES</p><p>Bill Fitzgerald, the resident master blacksmith at Muscoot Farm, will teach blacksmithing in five-hour sessions on the next three Saturdays. Students will choose their own projects and work under his individual supervision, after an orientation on basic techniques and safety precautions.</p><p>The farm is on Route 100 in Somers, of Exit 6 of I-684. The $65 fee includes all materials. Pre-registration is required. Call 232-7118. CHINESE DISCOVERIES</p><p>Three newly discovered neolithic cultures and a Bronze Age culture in Sichuan Province are among the archeological findings in China to be discussed by Dr. Jean M. James, a specialist in the art and archeology of early China at the University of Iowa.</p><p>"New Surprises in a Decade of Discovery" is the title of her talk, today at 7:30 P.M. in the Scarsdale Public Library on the Post Road. The talk is sponsored by the Westchester Society of the Archeological Institute of America.</p><p>Silks and artifacts from royal tombs dating from the fourth to the eighth century B.C. are among the treasures retrieved at the digs. Admission is by donation of $3.</p>                </div>
