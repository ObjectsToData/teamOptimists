                    <p>JOSEPH CONRAD    A Biography. By Jeffrey Meyers. Illustrated. 428 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $27.50.</p><p>"The necessity which impelled me  [ to go to sea and to become a writer ]  was a hidden, obscure necessity, a completely masked and unaccountable phenomenon," Joseph Conrad wrote in "A Personal Record."</p><p>Born in 1857 in the Polish Ukraine, to impoverished landed gentry with a family history of courageous, if reckless, patriotism, Joseph Conrad (ne Jozef Teodor Konrad Nalecz Korzeniowski) became in the course of his difficult lifetime a paragon of the post-Flaubertian literary artist: the writer of idiosyncratic and obsessive genius who is neglected for most of his career by the general reading public, but celebrated by his fellow writers; the virtual martyr to his art who exhausts himself in its service, as in the worship of an inscrutable god. By the time of Conrad's death in 1924, at the age of 66, he was considered one of the greatest writers in contemporary English, though his spoken English was still so bad that even acquaintances had trouble understanding him. His stature has strengthened posthumously, partly as a result of the text-conscious New Criticism of the 50's (for which Conrad's elegantly fashioned, ironic prose is ideally suited) and partly as a result of our general skepticism concerning the morality of imperial politics and "progress" -- the bringing of the light into "the dark places of the earth" by European Christianity.</p><p>Though he was born Roman Catholic, Conrad acknowledged no religion and wrote of the supernatural only as superstition. He knew nature firsthand, having been a merchant seaman for 20 years -- thus he was no nature mystic, and detested what he perceived to be sentimentalism in Herman Melville (with whom, to his disgust, he was repeatedly compared). His masters were Flaubert, Turgenev and Henry James; his intention as an artist was, as he states in the celebrated preface to "The Nigger of the 'Narcissus,' " to appeal to the reader's temperament -- "to make you hear, to make you feel . . . to make you    see.   " Yet he was a passionate moralist, a philosophical writer whose primary subject is the individual and his relationship to the human community.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Though Conrad's vision is tragic (he might have said realistic), his tone is often comic. His dense, convoluted prose, English uneasily qualified by undercurrents of the Polish and French that were the author's earlier languages, is sometimes obscure. (An early reviewer, even as he acknowledged Conrad's greatness, complained that "his story is not so much told as seen intermittently through a haze of sentences . . . like a river-mist.") Yet, at times, his prose is swift, sensuous and cinematic in a manner that, as Jeffrey Meyers shrewdly notes in "Joseph Conrad: A Biography," seems to have directly inspired Ernest Hemingway. Among Conrad's most compelling works of fiction are "The Nigger of the 'Narcissus,' " "Lord Jim," "The Secret Agent" and "The Secret Sharer"; his extraordinary long novel "Nostromo," a prophetic tragedy of "material interests" set in an invented but vividly rendered Central American republic, is one of the underrated masterpieces of 20th-century English literature. Conrad's most famous work, based upon his traumatic experience in the Belgian Congo in 1890, is the novella "Heart of Darkness," a Symbolist masterpiece narrated by the eloquent, brooding Marlow, to whom, as to his creator, "the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine." "Heart of Darkness" was the source of Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam film "Apocalypse Now," and it is surely one of the perennial best sellers in English literature -- in both its original text and in its handy Cliffs Notes gloss for students.</p><p>"The great irony of Conrad's artistic career," Jeffrey Meyers says, "was that he had poor sales for his greatest books and popular acclaim for his late, inferior work, which he himself called 'secondhand Conrad ese.' " Mr. Meyers might have added that Conrad's posthumous popularity -- including the success of "Apocalypse Now" -- deepens the irony and would certainly have astonished Conrad, so desperate for money through most of his life, and so demeaned by the effort to get it. (As a young man, in 1878, after having lost 800 francs in a Monte Carlo gaming room, Conrad tried to commit suicide. As late as 1911, while working on "Under Western Eyes," and approaching a nervous breakdown, Conrad was complaining bitterly of receiving only $:300 for the serial rights to that novel: "Think of those awful creatures who get thousands. . . .    Mais,    I am always under the water.")</p><p>Conrad's life abounded in ironies and contradictions. While believing himself a pragmatic person, one committed to facts and "sound method," he was often obsessed with unrealistic plans and projects: during his youthful seagoing years he hoped to earn money outside the merchant service (which paid little) by way of whaling ventures, Australian pearl fisheries, the Japanese Navy, even work of some sort for an American politician. Though, by the age of 30, Conrad was the sole Polish-born captain in the British merchant marine, an achievement in itself, he experienced continual difficulty getting work, and, after 1894, never succeeded in getting another berth, realizing bitterly that he had spent 20 years mastering an art that was no longer needed. Moreover, however he was to romanticize the sea in his fiction, Conrad seems to have hated it in reality: "He detested the sea as a man detests a cast-off mistress . . .; his passion became to live out of sight of the sea and all its memories," as his friend Ford Madox Ford said. Another irony lay in the fact that while Conrad wrote so powerfully of the physical life, the manly life removed from female companionship and society, he was very often near-crippled with gout and numerous ailments, some of which appear to have been neurasthenic. He was, as Mr. Meyers states, "often maniacally depressed"; susceptible to violent mood swings, absent-minded and impractical, he was utterly dependent upon his wife, his servants and his friends.</p>                </div>
