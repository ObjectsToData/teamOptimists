And it was something that Mr. Rudenstine's predecessor, the cool, remote Derek C. Bok, had not done in his 20-year stewardship.</p><p>The gesture symbolizes one of the major changes Mr. Rudenstine is trying to bring to Harvard: a greater concern with undergraduate students. And, as it turned out, Mr. Rudenstine's first office-hours session "worked out very nicely," he said in a recent interview here, a few days before his inauguration ceremony on Friday. 'Just Very Chatty'</p><p>None of the six students who showed up came with "non-negotiable demands," Mr. Rudenstine said.  "They were just very chatty."</p>                </div>

                    <p>So far, that is the kind of reception the 56-year-old Mr. Rudenstine, a scholar of Renaissance literature, has received from almost all of Harvard.</p><p>"I am very impressed and immensely pleased with him," said John Dowling, a professor of biology and master of Leverett House, a residence for undergraduates. Professor Dowling recalled that Mr. Rudenstine had attended a recent dinner at Leverett House and that he had stood in line to greet all the students and professors who showed up.</p><p>Rebecca Walkowitz, president of The Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper, said, "There is definitely a feeling he is a listener and is really concerned with undergraduate education. That is encouraging."</p><p>The new atmosphere is part of Mr. Rudenstine's overall plan for Harvard: to find new "energy and coherence by putting Humpty Dumpty slightly together again in a different way," rather than to make his mark by building a new professional school, as Mr. Bok did with the John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p><p>Mr. Rudenstine's commitment to undergraduate education grows out of his own experience as a student at Princeton and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford -- both institutions that have a strong tradition of individual instruction and small class size. And in Harvard he has come to an institution in which undergraduates have long complained of benign neglect.</p><p>Another part of his plan is to restructure the university, which, almost alone among American institutions of higher learning, operates in a decentralized fashion, with each of its ten schools run as a separate organization.</p><p>A third goal, Mr. Rudenstine said, is to find ways to focus resources from Harvard's different schools on major contemporary issues, like education, the environment and health care.</p><p>More immediately, Mr. Rudenstine, who during the interview sat with his feet perched on a coffee table, plans to establish a provost, similar to the post he once held at Princeton University. A provost would have university-wide authority over academic affairs, helping the president oversee a more centralized administration. Mr. Rudenstine said he hopes to announce creation of the position by the end of the month.</p><p>Mr. Rudenstine, whose brow furrows deeply as he talks, has also put off Harvard's planned $2 billion fund-raising drive, one of the largest ever announced by an American university. He said he wanted another year or two to rethink how the money would be used.</p><p>One of his trickiest problems will be how to reorganize Harvard's different schools, each of which raises its own money and is responsible for its own administration.</p><p>"There aren't too many ways to fiddle with the system," he said, but one thing he will try to do "is to raise more money for the center, so that there really could be money you could allocate" to less affluent schools.</p><p>Another remedy he will try is to bring together some of the schools, for example, having the solidly endowed business school work with the impoverished education school to address the rising concern in the business community about the falling skills of high school graduates.</p><p>Among Mr. Rudenstine's ideas to improve undergraduate education is to have more students take more smaller classes, though he added that he recognizes "you can't turn Harvard into Princeton, and you wouldn't want to." And he said he was working with the faculty to set up a committee of professors that would oversee undergraduates, "to get a better sense of how much faculty time is going into undergraduate teaching."</p><p>To try to use the faculty better, he also has plans to build a Humanities Center, bringing together a number of departments, like the English Department, whose professors are now scattered in separate offices around the campus.</p><p>"If we could put people in close quarters so that they could see their colleagues and have a sense of the department," Mr. Rudenstine said, "that could make a big difference for the faculty and the students."</p><p>Photo: Neil L.
