    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  On the bulldozed crest of a sunbaked hill above the city, the directors of the J. Paul Getty Trust today unveiled the long-delayed design for one of the most ambitious art complexes in the world, the Getty Center.    Shaded by a giant white tent, they presented a wooden scale model of the center, designed by the architect Richard Meier, that will certainly be one of the most expensive building projects in recent times. The Getty's announced cost of $360 million does not take into account the cost of the site or its preparation or architectural fees, and some estimates have put the price tag as high as $1 billion, a figure the Getty disputes. The center will unite the trust's programs in the scholarship, education, conservation and display of the visual arts when it is completed in late 1996.">

Paul Getty Trust today unveiled the long-delayed design for one of the most ambitious art complexes in the world, the Getty Center.</p><p>Shaded by a giant white tent, they presented a wooden scale model of the center, designed by the architect Richard Meier, that will certainly be one of the most expensive building projects in recent times.

The center will unite the trust's programs in the scholarship, education, conservation and display of the visual arts when it is completed in late 1996.</p><p>"As far as we know, it's unique," said Stephen D. Rountree, the director of the building program. "I am not aware of any cultural institution that brings together on one small campus a major art museum, a major library and archives, educational programs and state-of-the-art computer applications in the humanities and scientific research."  Pare It Down, Build It Up</p><p>Pointing across the cleared hilltop, he said: "See that pile of rocks over there next to the Dumpster? That's about the midpoint of the Center for the History of Art and the Humanities."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Meier looked toward a row of earthmoving machines, parked silently in deference to today's event, and said, "What we are doing is, we are taking the earth away, we are building the buildings, and then we are putting the earth back again" to restore the hilltop's topography.</p><p>Mr. Meier said construction on the 6-building, 940,000-square-foot complex -- on 110 acres at the edge of the Santa Monica Mountains -- was set to begin on a five-year timetable that is the latest in a long string of target dates.</p><p>The center will include the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Art History Information Program, the Getty Center for Education in the Arts and the Getty Grant Program. The villa that now houses the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu will become a center for the study of Greek and Roman art. The Obstacle of Permits</p><p>"We took our time, to be sure, as the programs evolved," said Harold M. Williams, the president of the J. Paul Getty Trust. "It's nearly a million square feet, so it's not like throwing up an office building where all you do is build the shell. There's almost no 1,000 square feet that are the same as any other 1,000 square feet."</p><p>Progress was slowed and costs raised by, among other things, complex and time-consuming negotiations over various permits with state, city and local authorities. "Letters go back and forth," said Mr. Rountree. "Days pass. Weeks pass. It just takes time."</p><p>Coming some years after the doors to the center were originally expected to have opened, today's presentation of the design took on some of the aura of an inauguration.</p><p>The heavy fog of recent days cleared this morning, and the hilltop commanded bright views of the city and ocean on one side and the mountains, covered with chaparral and wildflowers, on the other.  The Trust's Huge Endowment</p><p>"This is a great day for me," said Mr. Meier, recalling his first visit and his many rambles across the rugged hillside as the themes for his buildings took shape in his mind.</p><p>Plans for the center began in 1982, shortly after the trust, a nonprofit foundation, received the bulk of Mr. Getty's personal estate, which has become an estimated $3.5 billion endowment that is the largest in the world.</p><p>The next year, the site was selected on the hilltop whose ridges, integrated into Mr. Meier's design, parallel the San Diego Freeway that passes below it.</p><p>Only after a conditional use permit was obtained from the city of Los Angeles in 1985 was it possible to begin serious work on the design, Mr. Rountree said. And even after that, the center continued to define its mission even as the design was taking shape.  Limiting the Intrusion</p><p>Among other things, local governments limited the height of the buildings and barred Mr. Meier from employing his signature white-tile exteriors. "We don't want to be able to see it, hear it or smell it," said Sue Young, a director of the Brentwood Homeowners Association, when a detailed local permit was issued in 1987.</p><p>In what he called "the most complex task imaginable," it was Mr. Meier's goal to design six separate buildings, each with its individual purpose and architectural identity, and yet to produce "a feeling of intimacy and coherence" among them.</p><p>John Walsh, the director of the museum, which is to rise on the city side of the hilltop, said the design would invite visitors to create their own itineraries and to move between the museum's indoor and outdoor spaces.</p><p>The buildings will be clustered along the two ridges of the hilltop, with terraced gardens sloping down to a landscaped ravine and reflecting pool. An underground parking garage and an elevated tramway up to the complex are designed to handle as many as 7,000 visitors a day.</p><p>Meanwhile, for the next five years, the hillside will be a giant construction site.</p><p>"Work has already begun on the parking structure," said Mr. Williams. "In Los Angeles, the first thing you do is build parking."</p><p>Photo: The directors of the J. Paul Getty Trust unveiled the long-delayed design for the Getty Center yesterday in Los Angeles.
