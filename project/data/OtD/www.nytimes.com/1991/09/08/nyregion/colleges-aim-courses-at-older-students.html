College enrollments for traditionally aged students have fallen. Last year, the number of 18-year-olds entering college fell 44 percent compared with those entering college in 1979. So colleges have been forced to seek other sources of students, particularly older ones, said Joseph Cullen, director of public relations at Iona College in New Rochelle.">

                    <p>SCHOOL BELLS start ringing this week for 12 million students older than 25 returning to school, and thereby helping themselves and their colleges.</p><p>College enrollments for traditionally aged students have fallen. Last year, the number of 18-year-olds entering college fell 44 percent compared with those entering college in 1979. So colleges have been forced to seek other sources of students, particularly older ones, said Joseph Cullen, director of public relations at Iona College in New Rochelle.</p><p>At Iona, executive-education programs have been created for adults seeking to do better work at their jobs or hoping to make career changes, Mr. Cullen said. "In many instances, a good part of their tuition fees are paid by the companies they work for."</p><p>And this year, enrollment in one such program, the Certified Employee Benefit Specialist program for trustees, administrators, actuaries, corporate benefit and union benefit managers, is high, said Teresa R. Gallo, the coordinator of Iona's School of General Studies.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"We feel it's because benefits have become so complicated and so expensive that those who administer corporate-benefit plans have to have a very specific knowledge of their structure today," she said. "The course, which is sponsored by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, also gives students the opportunity to earn professional accreditation."</p><p>For adults re-entering the job market or making a career change, Ms. Gallo said, Iona offers certificate programs in legal assistance, word processing, travel and tourism and fund-raising. "And our School of General Studies also offers baccalaureate programs in the evening and on weekends for those who want to earn a degree," she said.</p><p>Adults who have earned at least 60 semester academic hours and who have at least five years of practical work experience can now enroll in a new accelerated-degree program at Concordia College in Bronxville, said Lois Mills Chianese, assistant professor of business administration and co-director of the accelerated-degree program.</p><p>"The program is the first of its kind in Westchester specifically designed for the working adult," Ms. Chianese said. "By attending school one night a week and one Saturday a month, adult students can finish a New York State-accredited bachelor of science program in business administration in as little as a year." The accelerated-degree program has been available at four affiliated Concordia Colleges nationwide, which have reported having great success with it, Ms. Chianese added.  Global Perspective Stressed</p><p>"A lot of people left college without getting a degree, and at some time or another in their career feel that the lack of a degree is a handicap toward advancing in the workplace," said John W. Westerman, co-director of the Concordia program and an associate professor in business administration.</p><p>"And there are other people who, perhaps because of the recession, are realizing that a degree is essential if they are going to compete successfully in jobs in this tight economic climate," he added.</p><p>The Concordia program was developed to provide each student with a well-rounded, global perspective of the business world, Mr. Westeman added. He said 50 percent of the corporations in the area have offered tuition reimbursement to employees enrolling in the program.</p><p>Mr. Westerman, who recently met with some potential students from the human resources department at the Philip Morris Corporation in Rye Brook, said they liked the program's structure.</p><p>"We have made it very convenient for adults," he said. "We're holding the program on our campus in Bronxville over the span of 12 months, with class meetings held once a week in four-hour blocks of time. It also includes 10 mandatory Saturday seminars."</p><p>The curriculum of the Concordia program is based on the work of the traditional junior and senior years of business majors, Ms. Chianese said. "Students will earn 42 semester hours toward a bachelor of science degree in business administration." The degree requires a total of 122 hours.  Tuition Is All Inclusive</p><p>The cost of the accelerated executive education degree program has been set at $9,000 and includes tuition, lab fees, books and parking for the entire year. "We have structured it so there are no hidden costs," Mr. Westerman said. "Even lunches at the 10 Saturday seminars and evening snacks are included. All textbooks for each course will be available the first night of each class, because we don't think adult students should have to make special trips to the college book store in the middle of a workday."</p><p>In White Plains, the new Mercy College weekend program, also designed for working adults, will begin Friday.</p><p>Dr. John J. McGrath, dean of the White Plains campus, said: "We've been working on the program for a year, and after a year of market research plus our own experience of nontraditional student populations, we think we've designed a sensible program for those whose work schedules or personal commitments make it impossible for them to enroll in a traditional program. We've taken adult life styles into consideration.</p><p>"For instance, every third weekend is off for professional or family obligations. And our location in downtown White Plains makes the school convenient for a lot of students. Our enrollments are running well, just about as we predicted."  Credit for Experience</p><p>Tuition for the Mercy weekend program, Dean McGrath said, has been reduced to $185 a credit from Mercy's $276 a credit. "This gives our weekend program the lowest tuition for any bachelor's degree program within any independent college in Westchester," he said.</p><p>Students in the weekend program can take one to five classes each semester to help them earn a bachelor's degree in accounting or business administration with a specialization in management or office information systems in about four years, said Dean McGrath, who added that under Mercy's life-experience credit program, students may also be given college credit for work experience.</p><p>At Manhattanville College in Purchase, Rae Fischetti, assistant dean of adult special programs, said adult students are often turning toward liberal arts studies.</p><p>"This fall semester in our registrations, we are seeing out-of-work men and women who can afford it coming back to college to retrain," Ms. Fischetti said. "There are others who are looking for intellectual stimulation and are taking courses in the humanities, literature, philosophy and psychology."  Employers Give Aid</p><p>And many adult students enrolled in liberal arts master's degree programs are there with some financial support from their employers, she added.</p><p>"We find that corporations are giving employees tuition reimbursement for courses that develop critical-thinking skills and writing skills," she said.</p><p>Thomas N. Schappert, an International Business Machines human resources executive, has taken courses in the humanities one night a week at Manhattanville for three years. Mr. Schappert, who said he majored in business as an undergraduate and later received a master's degree in business administration, said he wanted to earn a master's degree in humanities through the Manhattanville adult program.</p><p>"I am back in college because I want to be there," he said, "I'm 48 years old, and I felt it was about time I rounded out my background. There are so many things I wanted to learn more about. The three hours I spend in class one night a week have opened my eyes to other worlds. And I think that's what learning's all about."</p><p>Photo: Lois Mills Chianese, top at left, and John W.
