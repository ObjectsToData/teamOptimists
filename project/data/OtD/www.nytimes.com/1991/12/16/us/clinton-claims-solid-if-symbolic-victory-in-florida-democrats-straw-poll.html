Bill Clinton of Arkansas won an overwhelming victory today in a Florida Democratic Party straw poll of Presidential contenders that many political professionals dismissed as a nonbinding popularity contest.</p><p>But as the first test of any kind in the 1992 Presidential race, the voting took on symbolic significance, and the Clinton campaign sought to portray the Governor's victory as an important sign of his strength.</p><p>With his base in the South, Mr. Clinton had been the favorite in the poll, and his campaign was widely viewed as the most vigorous in organizing to win the support of wavering delegates at the party's convention here. 'The First Step'</p><p>"This is just the first step," Mr. Clinton said after the vote, referring to the state's primary early next year. "Now we will build on this victory to win Florida in March -- and in November."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Rival campaigns played down today's result as a reflection of Mr. Clinton's advantage in the region and of his decision to pour resources into organizing here. They added that history showed that the outcome of the straw poll usually had little do to with who won the Florida primary or the party's presidential nomination.</p><p>Indeed, Mr. Clinton's opponents said that given the attention he focused on the straw poll, he was the only candidate who had any real stake in its outcome. "This was a must-win state for Bill Clinton," said Alan Greer, a trial lawyer who is chairman of the Florida campaign of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who came in second in today's voting but who also waged an aggressive effort. "This is not the electorate. These here are political insiders. We always do well with the electorate."</p><p>The vote today was strictly a preference poll by Democrats active in state politics and is not taken as any indication of how a candidate will do in the primary. But Florida politicians say it helps candidates identify Democrats who will work for them in the state, raising money and serving as campaign workers.</p><p>Mr. Clinton won 54 percent, or 950, of the 1,768 votes cast. Mr. Harkin got 549 votes, or 31 percent, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska got 181 votes, or 10 percent, and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts got 32 votes, nearly 2 percent.</p><p>Of the two other announced Democratic candidates, neither of whom addressed the convention nor made organization efforts, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia got 24 votes, barely more than 1 percent, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California won 4 votes.</p><p>Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who has not announced whether he will run, got 21 votes. But there was clear resentment here over his indecision. Each time his name was called out in the county-by-county balloting, the hall erupted in boos and hisses. Looking for Cuomo</p><p>"Cuomo's dillydallying has hurt him," said Eric Kaplan, a delegate from Seminole and a candidate for state representative, who said he would be inclined to support Mr. Cuomo were he in the race but who cast his vote for Mr. Clinton. "He's given the appearance of being completely undecided and wishy-washy."</p><p>Kitty McGill, a retired social worker and a delegate from Alachua, said it was "too late" for Mr. Cuomo to wage a strong campaign in the South. But she added: "I think Clinton is the most electable Democrat. He's absolutely electrifying to listen to."</p><p>Today, in Albany, referring to the result, Governor Cuomo quipped at a news conference: "I think if I were there; if I had made it a campaign, myself, personally, and made a few speeches, I could have gotten 30 or 40 votes."</p><p>Democratic strategists here had portrayed the straw poll as a race between Mr. Harkin and Mr. Clinton. Mr. Harkin had the support of organized labor, which had strong representation here.</p><p>Even before the balloting, Mr. Kerrey sought to play down his expectations, saying in an interview, "It doesn't have any importance to me at his stage of the game." He said he had attended the convention "to give Floridians a chance to know who I am."</p><p>The chairman of Mr. Kerrey's Florida campaign, State Representative Michael I. Abrams, said the campaign simply had decided not to expend too many resources into a race that had no direct bearing on the state's primary.  But, he added: "If Kerrey had won, would I be spinning a different tale today? Of course I would." Clinton's Ground Work</p><p>In an effort to have the strongest presence here, Mr. Clinton's campaign supplied placards illuminated by built-in flashlights to the delegates, bused in college students from Arkansas to cheer for him and mailed videotapes of the candidate to all the delegates.</p><p>David Wilhelm, the Clinton campaign's national chairman, denied reports that the campaign had spent at least $100,000 on its effort here, saying it spent closer to $25,000 or $30,000.</p><p>"This election wasn't about nuts-and-bolts organizing," Mr. Wilhelm said. "It was about message. It was a broad-based victory. We won in every single part of the state. We knew that one-third of the delegates, when they arrived here, were undecided."</p><p>Charles H. Purdy, a delegate from Naples who is a college humanities instructor, said, "Clinton had to do well because that was the perception of party professionals." Mr. Purdy, a Clinton backer, added, "It's important because it's the first race in the nation."</p><p>But Simon Ferro, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, said he viewed the state convention as more important in re-energizing the state party than in elevating the prospects of any candidate.</p><p>Mr. Ferro said there were also benefits to all of the party's Presidential candidates. "This was worth a lot of money to them in terms of national exposure," he said.</p>                </div>
