    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="    This is another in a series of columns answering questions from readers about New York's changing streetscapes.   Sacheverell Mongoose    Q.    What do you know about the life and work of Sacheverell Mongoose, to whom the 1978 A.I.A. Guide to New York City attributes the rowhouses at the northwest corner of 84th Street and Madison Avenue? . . . Prof. David Bady, director, the City and the Humanities Program, City University of New York.     A. The late Elliott Willensky, co-author of the guide, said about 10 years ago that the name was a fiction, inserted in the second edition to catch those who pirated its research -- of whom there were many.    In fact, this unusual row of buildings was designed in 1891 by John H. Duncan, who had won the competition for Grant's Tomb three years before. These houses seem to combine elements of Greek, prairie and Renaissance styling. There were originally six houses with an apartment house at the north end of the row. In 1977 the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed a Metropolitan Museum Historic District that included all six houses, but the northern three were exempted from designation because a developer, John J. Avlon, protested. About eight years later they were replaced by the present apartment tower at 30 East 85th Street.   The current edition of the A.I.A. Guide correctly credits the remaining houses. No one seems to have appropriated the misleading Mongoose attribution. The 'Chateau' on West End    Q.    What is the unusual building on the west side of West End Avenue, between 72d and 73d Streets? It looks like a chateau, but has been very changed at the top. . . . Richard Giglio, Manhattan.     A. The limestone town house at 266 West End Avenue was built in 1896 for the family of Julius N. Jaros, an importer who occupied it only through 1906.   It appears that the peaked tile roof was removed to add a modernistic fifth floor in a 1944 alteration by the architect Harry Hurwit. By that time it had already been converted into a multiple dwelling. York Avenue History    Q.    My family owned a building at 1335 York Avenue for 100 years beginning in the 1860's. When was it built? . . . Charlotte Healy Whalen, Massapequa, L.I.     A. William Glass bought the land in 1868 and the two-story brick house shows up on yearly property tax records for the first time in 1869, suggesting that your family may have built it. But no Glasses occupied the house until 1883, when the widowed Margaret Glass is first listed there.    The 1890 census records 13 occupants at that address: Margaret Glass and two children, five members of the Varcasia family and five members of the Bissinger family. Some of these probably occupied a building that stood at the rear of the lot. A 1940 photograph shows the house with an awning reading Healy's Dining Room. The Glass family -- by this time including Healy relatives -- sold the building to make way for the Mary Manning Walsh Home in 1966.  East 87th Brownstones    Q.    The south side of my block, East 87th Street between York and East End Avenues, is built up with brownstones, the north side with small apartment houses. I have heard the plan was for the poorer people on the north side to serve the richer people on the south side. True? . . . Howard Davis, Manhattan.     A. The brownstone rowhouses on the south side were all built between 1871 and 1875; the buildings on the north side were built in 1891 to 1893 as &quot;flats&quot; -- midway between tenements and luxury apartment houses. All were built by different groups of professional developers and it is unlikely that there was any link between the two building episodes: The ideal of the 19th-century private householder was to live on a street restricted to like dwellings.    The shift in developers' choices in what to build also represents a change in the housing market in the area. After the Civil War, Beekman Place, Sutton Place and East End Avenue were attractive locales for rowhouse construction. But towards the end of the century they declined, in part because of the increasing age of their housing stock, in part because of the industrialization of such waterfront areas. Land for flat and tenement construction usually brought lower prices than land suitable for private house construction. During the revival of these areas after World War I the most attractive were those with a large existing private house stock. Mount Morris Sanitorium    Q.    I was born in Harlem in the &quot;Mount Morris Park Sanitorium&quot; on Aug. 26, 1925. Where was it? . . . Janice Stern, West Hartford, Conn.     A. The seven-story building was built in 1923 at the southwest corner of 121st Street and Mount Morris Park West (now Nathan L. Davis Place) by Hermann Reichmann, whose &quot;Hydropathic Institute&quot; was across the park on Madison Avenue. Jeffrey Roualt, a neighborhood resident, said the building was once one of the few hospitals where black doctors could serve their residency. It is now a women's prison.">

	data-description="    This is another in a series of columns answering questions from readers about New York's changing streetscapes.   Sacheverell Mongoose    Q.    What do you know about the life and work of Sacheverell Mongoose, to whom the 1978 A.I.A. Guide to New York City attributes the rowhouses at the northwest corner of 84th Street and Madison Avenue? . . . Prof. David Bady, director, the City and the Humanities Program, City University of New York.     A. The late Elliott Willensky, co-author of the guide, said about 10 years ago that the name was a fiction, inserted in the second edition to catch those who pirated its research -- of whom there were many.    In fact, this unusual row of buildings was designed in 1891 by John H. Duncan, who had won the competition for Grant's Tomb three years before. These houses seem to combine elements of Greek, prairie and Renaissance styling. There were originally six houses with an apartment house at the north end of the row. In 1977 the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed a Metropolitan Museum Historic District that included all six houses, but the northern three were exempted from designation because a developer, John J. Avlon, protested. About eight years later they were replaced by the present apartment tower at 30 East 85th Street.   The current edition of the A.I.A. Guide correctly credits the remaining houses. No one seems to have appropriated the misleading Mongoose attribution. The 'Chateau' on West End    Q.    What is the unusual building on the west side of West End Avenue, between 72d and 73d Streets? It looks like a chateau, but has been very changed at the top. . . . Richard Giglio, Manhattan.     A. The limestone town house at 266 West End Avenue was built in 1896 for the family of Julius N. Jaros, an importer who occupied it only through 1906.   It appears that the peaked tile roof was removed to add a modernistic fifth floor in a 1944 alteration by the architect Harry Hurwit. By that time it had already been converted into a multiple dwelling. York Avenue History    Q.    My family owned a building at 1335 York Avenue for 100 years beginning in the 1860's. When was it built? . . . Charlotte Healy Whalen, Massapequa, L.I.     A. William Glass bought the land in 1868 and the two-story brick house shows up on yearly property tax records for the first time in 1869, suggesting that your family may have built it. But no Glasses occupied the house until 1883, when the widowed Margaret Glass is first listed there.    The 1890 census records 13 occupants at that address: Margaret Glass and two children, five members of the Varcasia family and five members of the Bissinger family. Some of these probably occupied a building that stood at the rear of the lot. A 1940 photograph shows the house with an awning reading Healy's Dining Room. The Glass family -- by this time including Healy relatives -- sold the building to make way for the Mary Manning Walsh Home in 1966.  East 87th Brownstones    Q.    The south side of my block, East 87th Street between York and East End Avenues, is built up with brownstones, the north side with small apartment houses. I have heard the plan was for the poorer people on the north side to serve the richer people on the south side. True? . . . Howard Davis, Manhattan.     A. The brownstone rowhouses on the south side were all built between 1871 and 1875; the buildings on the north side were built in 1891 to 1893 as "flats" -- midway between tenements and luxury apartment houses. All were built by different groups of professional developers and it is unlikely that there was any link between the two building episodes: The ideal of the 19th-century private householder was to live on a street restricted to like dwellings.    The shift in developers' choices in what to build also represents a change in the housing market in the area. After the Civil War, Beekman Place, Sutton Place and East End Avenue were attractive locales for rowhouse construction. But towards the end of the century they declined, in part because of the increasing age of their housing stock, in part because of the industrialization of such waterfront areas. Land for flat and tenement construction usually brought lower prices than land suitable for private house construction. During the revival of these areas after World War I the most attractive were those with a large existing private house stock. Mount Morris Sanitorium    Q.    I was born in Harlem in the "Mount Morris Park Sanitorium" on Aug. 26, 1925. Where was it? . . . Janice Stern, West Hartford, Conn.     A. The seven-story building was built in 1923 at the southwest corner of 121st Street and Mount Morris Park West (now Nathan L. Davis Place) by Hermann Reichmann, whose "Hydropathic Institute" was across the park on Madison Avenue. Jeffrey Roualt, a neighborhood resident, said the building was once one of the few hospitals where black doctors could serve their residency. It is now a women's prison."></div>
