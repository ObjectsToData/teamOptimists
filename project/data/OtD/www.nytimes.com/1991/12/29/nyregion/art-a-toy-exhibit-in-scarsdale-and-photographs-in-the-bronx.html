                    <p>THE Scarsdale Historical Society's Christmas special is "The Toys We Treasured," a collection of playthings that no doubt were taken for granted by their original owners. As for today's children reared on plastic, they may not even recognize them as toys, much less as treasures, unless briefed by parents, even grandparents.</p><p>It is not just the quality of materials and workmanship that has gone into these things -- 131 of them dating from the early 1800's through the 1930's, give or take a decade -- but the art, too. Take the dolls in the first case: some have hand-painted china heads with limbs beautifully modeled in bisque. Of the three small specimens grouped on and around a wood settee, the boy is left undressed, the better to see his cloth body, likewise the legs that end in glazed pink booties. Such details focus attention on the cultural chasm separating the past from the present. In another case, there are miniature porcelains from France and Germany that surely no one can have played with, especially that of the child in frills sitting in a sauceboat. Germany, by the way, contributes many dolls, including the pair in military uniforms whose bearded and mustachioed faces are modeled in bisque as if they were portraits.</p><p>Another outstanding figure is the black "Servant Boy" made in England during the 1930's. His modeled face and stuffed body is covered in brown velveteen, and he wears a white shirt, a well-cut vest of blue felt with white buttons and Dutch-boy pants in apricot velveteen.</p><p>Close to this relic of Imperialism is another black doll, a female jumping jack with nicely carved limbs. A rare item, it dates from the early 20th century but because of the long Afro, short orange dress and bright red pumps, it seems almost contemporary. Hanging nearby is a male jumping jack of the same vintage that has a face worthy of a Muppet and a bottle cap for a hat. All this and a row of doll purses, too! Note the masterpiece made of microscopic beads in silvery gray, pink and blue, with a fringe of twisted loops. From Bali come solid wood puppets in elaborate costumes (as opposed to the silhouettes used for shadow puppetry) and, from Japan, exquisitely clothed wood and porcelain figures -- two of them Samurais -- that seem more like sculptures than dolls. In fact they are, the catalogue says, heirlooms reserved for formal display in March, the month in which the Japanese Doll Festival is held.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Tearing themselves away from the dolls (if they can), visitors will find the toys used in Friedrich Froebel's "Kindergarten Movement," which took hold in Germany and other European countries during the 1850's, spreading later to the United States. There is an 1896 photograph of Bennington's Experimental Kindergarten in action, together with examples of the toys used. Not to be missed are the small wood blocks that Frank Lloyd Wright played with as a child and their tongue-and-groove box or, for that matter, the cabin half assembled out of logs painted orange. Did they learn more with less in those days?</p><p>The range of objects is vast: tiny tea sets, christening cradles, ivory chess pieces made in China and, in the department of miniaturized technology, two sewing machines, one a Singer (circa 1895), and both seemingly in working order. Straight from early Hollywood is a toy sound-and-film projector with a record labeled "The Harper Columbia Book That Sings" and Margaret O'Brien and Shirley Temple dolls. Nancy and Sluggo are also present as dolls, but they look their best on a comic book cover, licking the giant pink ice cream cone between them. Sluggo says, "Too bad this is only a dream." Nancy replies, "Keep quiet, we might wake up."</p><p>Does the world know that there were Teddy's bears before there were teddy bears and that Theodore Roosevelt, when lending his name, doubted that it would "mean much in the bear business"? The only bear in the show is a German Zotty bear with an unruly coat. But an English elephant named Arthur is on hand, Babar with a rakish trunk.</p><p>Reflecting the history of industrial design are items like the ocean liner Roamer (circa 1923) with its vertical prow, the all-black Buddy L Roadster Truck, Lionel's Commodore Vanderbilt Chrome Train, a cast-iron Graf Zeppelin and a replica of the late Pan American's China Clipper -- all from the 1930's. Come to think of it, the recent history of everything Western can be inferred from this remarkable show, which was curated by Nira Abramowitz and remains on view through March 8. The society is at the corner of White Plains Post Road and Boulevard, in Scarsdale. 723-1744.</p><p>Improbable as it may seem, there are coincidences between the history at Scarsdale and that recounted by Jack Delano's black and white photographs of Puerto Rico at the Bronx Museum of Fine Arts. In 1941, Mr. Delano, a Farm Security Administration photographer fresh from cutting a swath through the United States, arrived in San Juan to do the same for Puerto Rico. It turned out to be the first of several visits, and the result is this show and its brochure called "Contrasts: 40 years of Change and Continuity in Puerto Rico."</p><p>A snappier title might have been "Before and After," but this is a project sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Puerto Rico Endowment for the Humanities, bodies not known for their concision.</p><p>In the 1940's, Puerto Rico was still dependent on the cash crop of sugar, hence the study of the planter, Don Luis Quinones, at ease in his house with a bird perched on his finger -- and the shot of an agricultural laborer's thatched cottage. That this little casita could be one of those featured in the adjoining show about the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York City suggests that there is some nostalgia for the rural past.</p><p>In prints from the 1980's, progress strikes -- with supermarkets and condominiums, traffic jams and computers. Sugar is harvested by a single cane cutter instead of men with carts drawn by long-horned oxen. When Don Toli was cutting cane in the 1940's he might have said, "Another day, another 25 cents." Now he sits all alone in retirement with a television and a radio.</p><p>A 1946 schoolgirl learns math with spools threaded on a cord, abacus style; a 1989 class sits at its word processors. One may laugh at the debutantes of 1941, wearing ball gowns and tiaras that spell out "God Bless America," but what to feel about the contemporary graduates proceeding to yuppiedom, or the man tied to his bed in a detox ward? But if Condado is packed, Waikiki style, with high-rise condos, the view of mountains poking through morning mist near Cidra is unchanged.</p><p>Mr. Delano is no sentimentalist; he obviously loves the country and wants the best for it. Yet he seems to be wondering why progress always has to take more than it gives, why up-to-date urban deprivation always looks so much worse than the old-fashioned rural kind. It doesn't hurt to ask.</p><p>This affecting show closes Jan. 12. The Bronx Museum is at the corner of 165th Street and Grand Concourse; (212) 681-6000.</p><p>Photos: Porcelain dolls with hand-painted china heads, at the Scarsdale Historical Society.; A child in frills sitting in a sauceboat.
