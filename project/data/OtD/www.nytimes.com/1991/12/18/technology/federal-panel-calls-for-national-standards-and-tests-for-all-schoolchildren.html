Such standards would spell out, for the first time on a national level, what children should be expected to learn and what level of achievement is good enough at different stages, according to the National Council on Education Standards and Testing, an advisory group of major political and educational leaders whose approval is crucial to the success of any such effort. The council, created by Congress last June, concluded its deliberations today. Its final report will be made public in mid-January.">

The council, created by Congress last June, concluded its deliberations today. Its final report will be made public in mid-January.</p><p>The council asked Congress to provide money for a successor group to put the recommendations into effect. But council members said the movement was bound to proceed anyway because President Bush made these ideas the cornerstone of his strategy to revive American schools. Several groups are already working to develop national standards in specific subjects and prototypes of national tests. Concern and Opposition</p><p>But because the panel was charged only to consider the broad outlines of national standards and tests, many crucial details are yet to be worked out, prompting concern and opposition from some educators. They worry that setting standards without providing schools the resources to help meet them will end up discriminating against poor children who attend inadequate schools.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Also, excessively detailed standards could create a national curriculum, stifling teacher creativity, denying parents a voice and causing political battles over what children should learn, the educators say. And they fear that without considerable money and commitment to devise sophisticated tests, national tests could end up resembling the same widely reviled standardized tests that American children take now.</p><p>Despite such fears, which have been expressed even among some of its members, the council concluded that standards and tests were essential to reach the education goals that the President and the nation's governors have set for the year 2000. These include making American children the best in the world in mathematics and science achievement and insuring that they demonstrate competency in five core subjects: English, mathematics, science, history and geography.</p><p>National standards in these subjects and national tests, the council's draft report said, will help in these ways: "First, they can help us extend educational opportunity to all Americans. Second, they can strengthen our democratic institutions and values while enabling all of our citizens to participate effectively in the political process. Third, they can enhance our economic competitiveness."</p><p>Although such standards and tests would be voluntary, the council recommended incentives for states and local school districts to adopt them, like tying Federal scholarships to test results, or penalties for schools that have high failure rates.</p><p>But such incentives or sanctions were not spelled out in the report, reflecting sharp disagreements between those council members who see consequences as the only way to enforce high standards and those who fear they might discriminate against poor or minority students who score badly because they attend inadequate schools.</p><p>In either case, the very existence of national standards and tests would represent a radical departure from a longstanding American tradition of local control, which has led to a patchwork of curriculum requirements and tests. "It was a fairly historic session," Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the council's co-chairman, said of its work. The other co-chairman is Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina. Some Ways to Set National Standards</p><p>Governor Romer emphasized that setting national standards did not mean imposing a national curriculum. Instead, the council called for broad descriptions of core knowledge and skills -- saying, for example, that all children should learn certain principles of algebra and be able to use tables and graphs. In addition to such content standards, the council called for performance standards, or how to decide what achievement is good enough at certain stages.</p><p>The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has already drawn up nationwide mathematics standards. The National Academy of Sciences, with the help of other groups, is working on science standards. The National Endowment for the Humanities today announced a $1.6 million grant to develop history standards. And California has drawn up curriculum outlines in several subjects.</p><p>The council proposed that its successor body examine such efforts and certify those that meet what they called "world-class standards." But many politically explosive issues remain unresolved.</p><p>While it is relatively easy in science and math to agree on what principles children should know, efforts in New York and California to do so in history and English have produced bruising battles. California's history guidelines and the textbooks based on them, while widely praised by many educators, have been bitterly fought by several ethnic groups who believe that their histories had been improperly told.</p>                </div>
