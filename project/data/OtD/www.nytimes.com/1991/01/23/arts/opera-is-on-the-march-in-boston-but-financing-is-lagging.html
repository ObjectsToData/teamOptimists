                    <p>As Bruce Rossley, the city's Commissioner for the Arts and Humanities, said about a similar situation, the Boston opera scene is like "a feeding frenzy at an empty trough." A Non-Producing Group</p><p>There is even a fourth group: the well-heeled Bostonians who call themselves the Boston Opera Association stage no opera performances, their primary purpose up to 1986 having been the importation of the Metropolitan Opera on its annual tours. But they have declined to support any of the squabbling local companies.</p><p>Boston's near-comic operatic hyperactivity stems from the mid-1980's, when several separate events conspired. In 1985, Miss Caldwell fell ill, and while she has fully recovered, her incapacity highlighted her financial difficulties and encouraged competitors.</p><p>The next year, the Met dropped its spring tours, creating voids in several American cities, including Boston.</p><p>By 1987, the Lyric Opera had retired an accumulated $500,000 debt that dated back four years to an overambitious Wagner "Ring" cycle presented in Boston and at the Beacon Theater in New York, and felt ready to step up to a level beyond earnest community opera. Another Group Heard From</p><p>Then Mr. Sellars and his musical associate Craig Smith, encouraged by dissident board members from Miss Caldwell's company and support from local music critics, agreed to participate in the formation of a new company, the Boston Opera Theater.</p><p>Miss Caldwell has already announced a season of Tchaikovsky's "Eugen Onegin" with Russian sets and singers; the double bill of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" (with Shirley Verrett) and Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci," and, replacing a Leonard Bernstein "Mass" that was to have been a Russo-American co-production, a Puccini "Tosca."</p><p>Speaking over the weekend from Moscow, Miss Caldwell alluded to a budget of $2 million. She had placed her hopes for long-range survival in a theater-development plan organized three years ago by Mr. Rossley that would have entailed the city's purchase of the Opera House with state-bond money. This would have retired Miss Caldwell's debt (said to be between $5 million and $7 million) and permitted the theater's renovation. But dire economic straits scuttled the bond issue. One Crisis Weathered</p><p>The Lyric Opera, having weathered its "Ring"-induced crisis, now has a new general director in Justin Moss and a new artistic adviser in Richard Gaddes, who made the Opera Theater of St. Louis into a model of regional-opera excellence.</p><p>The Lyric seems committed to sensible -- meaning conservative -- productions of mostly mainstream repertory with an occasional safe novelty featuring promising American singers. Its board members are suspicious not only of Miss Caldwell, but also of Mr. Sellars, who has many conservative enemies and a somewhat similar reputation for flighty career commitments.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Moss hopes to build up the number of performances for each production beyond the present two, and to eventually expand the number of annual productions beyond the current three. He and his board have been heartened by the public and critical response to their Donizetti "Daughter of the Regiment" and "Ariadne" this season, and are looking forward to Marc Blitzstein's "Regina" in March. The current annual budget is about $600,000.</p><p>The Boston Opera Theater was formed by Robert Canon, who had been asked by Mr. Rossley and others to sort out Miss Caldwell's finances at the Opera Company of Boston. Mr. Sellars, though he emerged from the Boston scene, is now so busy that he will agree only to serve as artistic adviser and to direct his familiar Mozart trilogy over three years. 'Figaro' Five Times</p><p>Mr. Canon, who despite lively box-office interest and bold announcements has been slow to generate an actual working company, said that his budget for this first year, for the "Figaro" and start-up costs, was about $1 million. There will be five performances of the "Figaro" through Feb. 2.</p><p>For the future, he talks of a new version of the Boston composer John Harbison's "Winter's Tale," a collaboration with the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, a restaging of a Mark Lamos Puccini "Boheme" and possible joint importations with the Brooklyn Academy of Music. All</p><p>of this, Mr. Canon added, would entail an annual budget of nearly $3 million.</p><p>The Boston Opera Association, in the meantime, is biding its time, contenting itself with supporting Boston Symphony star-singer concerts and semi-staged operas at Symphony Hall and Tanglewood. It is also discussing support for a revitalized opera program at Tanglewood.</p><p>"The Boston Opera Association people had their life, being wined and dined in New York, and now they're searching for a new life," Miss Caldwell said.</p><p>Everyone seems to feel some coalescing of forces is inevitable. But no one seems eager to coalesce. Independence and Hostility</p><p>The still-charismatic Miss Caldwell is likely to remain outside any alliance.  "Sarah has poisoned the well," said Mr. Moss, citing Miss Caldwell's cancellations, schedule changes and last-minute bailouts. "As usual, she's now in total chaos."</p><p>Lawrence Perera, the association chairman, called her operation a "hair-raising ride that I and my board have no intention of galloping with."</p><p>Mr. Rossley, the arts commissioner, took a more sanguine view. "She has a history of being a phoenix," he said. "When people say there's no way there's going to be a season, it happens."</p><p>In the meantime, both Mr. Moss and Mr. Canon said that when the Boston Opera Theater "Figaro" performances ended, they and their boards would discuss cooperation.  "I don't know if it will be a merger or a cooperative venture or a split season," Mr. Canon said. "This is Boston -- it takes longer to get moving."</p><p>Miss Caldwell, blaming the recession for most of her troubles, suggested that the present artistic climate is less chaotic than invigorating. The combined budgets of the three active Boston companies this season are less than $4 million, compared with $37 million for the Boston Symphony and $106 million for the Metropolitan.</p><p>"There are a number of little worlds in Boston, and if you are within one company, that becomes your little world," Miss Caldwell said. "But maybe it's healthier, instead of one centralized company, to have different people absolutely determined to do what they do. You have to keep trying. All of these companies, including ours, will last as long as a certain number of people    will    them to last."</p><p>Photo: Deborah Voigt in the Boston Lyric Opera's "Ariadne auf Naxos."
