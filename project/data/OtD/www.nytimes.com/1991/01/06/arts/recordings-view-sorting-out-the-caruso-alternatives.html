A telling illustration is the legacy of Enrico Caruso, which never achieved an integral edition on LP. Few performers deserve such recognition more than Caruso, a singer not only splendidly endowed but also admirably conscientious, whose records made him the universal model for later generations of tenors, while his reputation played a major role in establishing the phonograph socially and economically.

And while the CD medium is reviving a remarkable range of material, the end products often suggest that sound recordings are not yet treated in accordance with their role in music and society.</p><p>A telling illustration is the legacy of Enrico Caruso, which never achieved an integral edition on LP. Few performers deserve such recognition more than Caruso, a singer not only splendidly endowed but also admirably conscientious, whose records made him the universal model for later generations of tenors, while his reputation played a major role in establishing the phonograph socially and economically. Although he remained an Italian citizen, his career centered in the United States, where he became a genuine folk hero to his immigrant compatriots and to everyone else as well.</p><p>Thus it doesn't seem utopian to expect his recordings to be carefully translated into the newest technology and packaged in a manner befitting their place in history. Other cultural legacies have long been handed down and restored with scrupulous care. For more than a century, international consortiums of scholars, supported by governments and foundations, have prepared authoritative printed editions of the music of the great masters. These days, classics of American literature receive comparable treatment, in collected editions emanating from university presses, underwritten by the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>Despite controversy over details, the desirability of doing such projects thoroughly and professionally is taken for granted. Though the resulting weighty tomes are destined principally for libraries, they also spawn popular editions for general readers, performers and listeners (in the foregoing literary example, the handsomely printed volumes of the Library of America). Regrettably, none of the three Caruso editions produced on CD in the last year matched comparable projects in other fields in vision, scholarship and technical quality.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The first, Bayer's "Caruso/Complete/ Compact" package, failed to live up to its billing, and appears to have been motivated only by opportunism. Two installments of "The Caruso Edition" followed, from England's Pearl label, using tapes prepared by the American engineer Ward Marston (Pearl EVC I and II; three disks each; two more volumes to come). BMG Classics last spring announced "The Complete Caruso" (RCA Gold Seal 60495-2-RG; 12 disks), and managed to get it into the stores in time for Christmas.</p><p>Which to go with? Indeed, except for sound archives and compulsives, who needs all of Caruso's recordings anyway? Myself, I may never play again many of the salon, sacred and popular songs he recorded in increasing proportion over the years -- though some are treasurable for their verve ("Luna d'estate,"), vocal polish ("Vaghissima sembianza") and sheer splendor (Adam's "Cantique de Noel"). From Franchetti's "Germania" in 1902 to Caruso's last new role, in Halevy's "Juive" in 1920, the operatic records are sui generis; no opera lover should be without at least a sampling. If nobody else's selection will satisfy you, it may be simpler to have it all. (A good starting point for beginners is EMI's single CD of early Caruso, CDH7 61046-2.)</p><p>These three sets sound strikingly different, and the layman may wonder why. Well, for one thing, recordings aren't like books or printed music. While a new printing of "Huckleberry Finn" in a modern typeface may lack the aura of the first edition, it still transmits the voice of Mark Twain: if Twain's letters, words and punctuation are correctly transcribed, his meaning is preserved. But sound is not made of such discrete elements; it is a wave, a continuum, analog rather than digital in nature, until recently actually preserved in analog form: undulations of record grooves, patterns of magnetic particles on tape.</p><p>Transferring that wave from one storage medium to another is a process full of variables and options -- and in a profound sense unverifiable. Printed editions can be proofread to insure equivalence to the original, but the "original" of a sound recording -- the actual performance -- is unavailable for comparison; it long ago vanished into thin air. Few now survive who heard Caruso in the flesh, and seven decades of listening to the records have doubtless colored their recollections.</p><p>So standards of judgment are ultimately subjective. Nobody objects to minimizing the nonmusical noises that afflicted older recordings -- but beyond a certain point this may entail altering or suppressing some musical content as well. How much "enhancement" of the musical sound by adding resonance, altering frequency balance, and the like, is justified? To what extent do the engineers modify the sound to match models inside their own ears? (And to what extent do listeners make similar comparisons?)</p>                </div>
