    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  DR. KING BREAKFAST     Marva Nettles Collins, founder of the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago, will be the keynote speaker at the 22d annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast tomorrow in Greenburgh.    A profound wish to instill a love for learning and respect for academic achievement in inner-city children led her to start the school in 1975 with her own $5,000 retirement pension. An initial enrollment of 18 pupils has grown to more than 200 students today, and the location of the school in a room of her home has shifted to two school-owned buildings.    Ms. Collins will talk about her memories of Dr. King and his dream that children from all backgrounds would someday be taught together, inspired by a standard of excellence -- a dream that she shares.    Her school and the numerous articles that she wrote about the problems of education in America led to the filming of &quot;The Marva Collins Story,&quot; a 1985 television drama that starred Cicely Tyson.    Admission to the breakfast, which begins at 8 A.M. in the Fairview-Greenburgh Community Center at 32 Manhattan Avenue, is $40. Part of the ticket price will be donated to educational and cultural programs for underprivileged children. For more information, call 682-3622. BABY-SITTING ADVICE     Baby sitters from the age of 10 through their mid-teen-age years will be getting advice from some adult professionals at a three-session baby-sitting workshop to be held on Saturdays at the Chappaqua Library's 200-seat auditorium. The program is offered free every other year and it attracts more than 100 youngsters interested in becoming first-rate child-minders.    The first one-and-one-half hour session, beginning at 10 A.M. Saturday, will be led by Dr. Robert Seaver, a child psychiatrist, who will discuss the physical and emotional changes in children; and Susan Apple, a nurse, who will focus on the care of infants.    The second session is at 10 A.M. on Feb.y 2, and features Dr. Michael Cohen, another pediatrician who will address emergency home-health procedures, and Kathy Dresner, an authority on crafts, storytelling and fingerplay (using fingers as characters), talking about how to keep children productively entertained.    On Feb. 9 Robert Breen, a youth officer with the New Castle Police Department, will talk about home safety and the procedures to follow in case of fire or other threatening situations; and Sandra Kellogg, a psychiatric social worker, will speak about making responsible decisions as a baby sitter.    The program has been so popular and so effective over the years that parents of small children often attend to look over the new crop of baby sitters and to make use of a bulletin board, where new sitters and prospective employers can leave their names and phone numbers for future job match-ups. For more information, call 238-4779. FRIEDLANDER PHOTOS     Industrial America was the landscape that Lee Friedlander recorded most frequently in his prolific career as a photographer. More than 150 of his black-and-white silver prints have been assembled for a retropective titled &quot;Like a One-Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee Friedlander 1956-1987&quot; at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York in Purchase. The show opens with a reception today from 3 to 5 P.M. and continues through April 14.    His special vision -- like a one-eyed cat's -- attracts attention in odd ways, like including his own shadow in a series of self-portraits, as though he were looming over the viewer's shoulder to catch the reaction. He eschews fancy titles for his pictures and merely identifies them with a proper name and date, allowing space for the viewer's imagination.    Street scenes, jazz musicians, motels, factory workers, historic statues that have become incongruous to their locations, and other subjects that he elevates from the commonplace are depicted in the collection.    A lecture on the exhibition will be delivered at 3 P.M. today in the Humanities Building Auditorium by Deborah Martin Kao, an art historian in the fine arts department of Boston College. The talk, titled &quot;Lee Friedlander's Factory Valley: Structure, Artifice, Culture,&quot; will focus on the artist's approach to the sociological issues at the heart of his photographs. Admission is $7. Admission to the exhibition is free or by donation of $2. Museum hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information, call 251-6133 or 6100. COURTING FLUTE     The courting flute made by the Blackfoot-Narragansett Indians was so named because its tone resembled the mating call of the loon. At the end of the instrument a carving was always made in the shape of a loon, while other small animals were carved at the top.    TChin, an Indian who makes and plays courting flutes, will conduct a program of Indian storytelling and flute-playing from 1:30 to 4 P.M. today at Wave Hill in Riverdale. He will have several examples of old and new flutes on display and will play many of his own compositions as well as traditional Indian tunes.    He has a broad background in art and crafts, as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, N.M., and through independent study with Indian elders nationwide.    The program will also feature a special art project -- finger puppet-making or drawing -- led by the resident Wave Hill artist Noah Baen. Hot chocolate and apple cider will be served afterward in front of a fire. Admission is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children.    Wave Hill is at 674 West 252d Street. Call (212) 549-3200 for more information. BOILED IN LEAD     Boiled in Lead, a four-man music group from Minnesota, will bring its disparate collection of instruments and wide-ranging repertoire to the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling tonight at 8 o'clock.    Robin Anders, Todd Menton, Drew Miller and Michael Ravez each play at least four instruments, including the doumbek, tapan and whistle, dulcimer, bodhran, kazoo, guitar, harmonica, tin whistle, fiddle, mandolin, drums and bouzouki.    In addition to original material, they play music from Serbia, Albania, Armenia, Thailand, a few former countries, plus Sweden and Appalachia, moving from one to another in rapid-fire succession backed by pounding rhythm.    Walt Michael &amp; Company is on the bill at 9 P.M. Friday with his renditions of bluegrass, mountain music, gospel and Irish folk; and Robert Gordon, the rockabilly artist, will perform at 9 P.M. Saturday.    The Towne Crier is at 62 Route 22. Admission tonight and Friday is $12.50, Saturday $15. Call 855-1300 for more information.">

	data-description="  DR. KING BREAKFAST     Marva Nettles Collins, founder of the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago, will be the keynote speaker at the 22d annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast tomorrow in Greenburgh.    A profound wish to instill a love for learning and respect for academic achievement in inner-city children led her to start the school in 1975 with her own $5,000 retirement pension. An initial enrollment of 18 pupils has grown to more than 200 students today, and the location of the school in a room of her home has shifted to two school-owned buildings.    Ms. Collins will talk about her memories of Dr. King and his dream that children from all backgrounds would someday be taught together, inspired by a standard of excellence -- a dream that she shares.    Her school and the numerous articles that she wrote about the problems of education in America led to the filming of "The Marva Collins Story," a 1985 television drama that starred Cicely Tyson.    Admission to the breakfast, which begins at 8 A.M. in the Fairview-Greenburgh Community Center at 32 Manhattan Avenue, is $40. Part of the ticket price will be donated to educational and cultural programs for underprivileged children. For more information, call 682-3622. BABY-SITTING ADVICE     Baby sitters from the age of 10 through their mid-teen-age years will be getting advice from some adult professionals at a three-session baby-sitting workshop to be held on Saturdays at the Chappaqua Library's 200-seat auditorium. The program is offered free every other year and it attracts more than 100 youngsters interested in becoming first-rate child-minders.    The first one-and-one-half hour session, beginning at 10 A.M. Saturday, will be led by Dr. Robert Seaver, a child psychiatrist, who will discuss the physical and emotional changes in children; and Susan Apple, a nurse, who will focus on the care of infants.    The second session is at 10 A.M. on Feb.y 2, and features Dr. Michael Cohen, another pediatrician who will address emergency home-health procedures, and Kathy Dresner, an authority on crafts, storytelling and fingerplay (using fingers as characters), talking about how to keep children productively entertained.    On Feb. 9 Robert Breen, a youth officer with the New Castle Police Department, will talk about home safety and the procedures to follow in case of fire or other threatening situations; and Sandra Kellogg, a psychiatric social worker, will speak about making responsible decisions as a baby sitter.    The program has been so popular and so effective over the years that parents of small children often attend to look over the new crop of baby sitters and to make use of a bulletin board, where new sitters and prospective employers can leave their names and phone numbers for future job match-ups. For more information, call 238-4779. FRIEDLANDER PHOTOS     Industrial America was the landscape that Lee Friedlander recorded most frequently in his prolific career as a photographer. More than 150 of his black-and-white silver prints have been assembled for a retropective titled "Like a One-Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee Friedlander 1956-1987" at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York in Purchase. The show opens with a reception today from 3 to 5 P.M. and continues through April 14.    His special vision -- like a one-eyed cat's -- attracts attention in odd ways, like including his own shadow in a series of self-portraits, as though he were looming over the viewer's shoulder to catch the reaction. He eschews fancy titles for his pictures and merely identifies them with a proper name and date, allowing space for the viewer's imagination.    Street scenes, jazz musicians, motels, factory workers, historic statues that have become incongruous to their locations, and other subjects that he elevates from the commonplace are depicted in the collection.    A lecture on the exhibition will be delivered at 3 P.M. today in the Humanities Building Auditorium by Deborah Martin Kao, an art historian in the fine arts department of Boston College. The talk, titled "Lee Friedlander's Factory Valley: Structure, Artifice, Culture," will focus on the artist's approach to the sociological issues at the heart of his photographs. Admission is $7. Admission to the exhibition is free or by donation of $2. Museum hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information, call 251-6133 or 6100. COURTING FLUTE     The courting flute made by the Blackfoot-Narragansett Indians was so named because its tone resembled the mating call of the loon. At the end of the instrument a carving was always made in the shape of a loon, while other small animals were carved at the top.    TChin, an Indian who makes and plays courting flutes, will conduct a program of Indian storytelling and flute-playing from 1:30 to 4 P.M. today at Wave Hill in Riverdale. He will have several examples of old and new flutes on display and will play many of his own compositions as well as traditional Indian tunes.    He has a broad background in art and crafts, as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, N.M., and through independent study with Indian elders nationwide.    The program will also feature a special art project -- finger puppet-making or drawing -- led by the resident Wave Hill artist Noah Baen. Hot chocolate and apple cider will be served afterward in front of a fire. Admission is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children.    Wave Hill is at 674 West 252d Street. Call (212) 549-3200 for more information. BOILED IN LEAD     Boiled in Lead, a four-man music group from Minnesota, will bring its disparate collection of instruments and wide-ranging repertoire to the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling tonight at 8 o'clock.    Robin Anders, Todd Menton, Drew Miller and Michael Ravez each play at least four instruments, including the doumbek, tapan and whistle, dulcimer, bodhran, kazoo, guitar, harmonica, tin whistle, fiddle, mandolin, drums and bouzouki.    In addition to original material, they play music from Serbia, Albania, Armenia, Thailand, a few former countries, plus Sweden and Appalachia, moving from one to another in rapid-fire succession backed by pounding rhythm.    Walt Michael & Company is on the bill at 9 P.M. Friday with his renditions of bluegrass, mountain music, gospel and Irish folk; and Robert Gordon, the rockabilly artist, will perform at 9 P.M. Saturday.    The Towne Crier is at 62 Route 22. Admission tonight and Friday is $12.50, Saturday $15. Call 855-1300 for more information."></div>

BABY-SITTING ADVICE</p><p>Baby sitters from the age of 10 through their mid-teen-age years will be getting advice from some adult professionals at a three-session baby-sitting workshop to be held on Saturdays at the Chappaqua Library's 200-seat auditorium.

Saturday, will be led by Dr. Robert Seaver, a child psychiatrist, who will discuss the physical and emotional changes in children; and Susan Apple, a nurse, who will focus on the care of infants.</p><p>The second session is at 10 A.M. on Feb.y 2, and features Dr. Michael Cohen, another pediatrician who will address emergency home-health procedures, and Kathy Dresner, an authority on crafts, storytelling and fingerplay (using fingers as characters), talking about how to keep children productively entertained.</p><p>On Feb. 9 Robert Breen, a youth officer with the New Castle Police Department, will talk about home safety and the procedures to follow in case of fire or other threatening situations; and Sandra Kellogg, a psychiatric social worker, will speak about making responsible decisions as a baby sitter.</p><p>The program has been so popular and so effective over the years that parents of small children often attend to look over the new crop of baby sitters and to make use of a bulletin board, where new sitters and prospective employers can leave their names and phone numbers for future job match-ups. For more information, call 238-4779. FRIEDLANDER PHOTOS</p><p>Industrial America was the landscape that Lee Friedlander recorded most frequently in his prolific career as a photographer. More than 150 of his black-and-white silver prints have been assembled for a retropective titled "Like a One-Eyed Cat: Photographs by Lee Friedlander 1956-1987" at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York in Purchase. The show opens with a reception today from 3 to 5 P.M. and continues through April 14.</p><p>His special vision -- like a one-eyed cat's -- attracts attention in odd ways, like including his own shadow in a series of self-portraits, as though he were looming over the viewer's shoulder to catch the reaction. He eschews fancy titles for his pictures and merely identifies them with a proper name and date, allowing space for the viewer's imagination.</p><p>Street scenes, jazz musicians, motels, factory workers, historic statues that have become incongruous to their locations, and other subjects that he elevates from the commonplace are depicted in the collection.</p><p>A lecture on the exhibition will be delivered at 3 P.M. today in the Humanities Building Auditorium by Deborah Martin Kao, an art historian in the fine arts department of Boston College. The talk, titled "Lee Friedlander's Factory Valley: Structure, Artifice, Culture," will focus on the artist's approach to the sociological issues at the heart of his photographs. Admission is $7. Admission to the exhibition is free or by donation of $2. Museum hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information, call 251-6133 or 6100. COURTING FLUTE</p><p>The courting flute made by the Blackfoot-Narragansett Indians was so named because its tone resembled the mating call of the loon. At the end of the instrument a carving was always made in the shape of a loon, while other small animals were carved at the top.</p><p>TChin, an Indian who makes and plays courting flutes, will conduct a program of Indian storytelling and flute-playing from 1:30 to 4 P.M. today at Wave Hill in Riverdale. He will have several examples of old and new flutes on display and will play many of his own compositions as well as traditional Indian tunes.</p><p>He has a broad background in art and crafts, as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design and the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, N.M., and through independent study with Indian elders nationwide.</p><p>The program will also feature a special art project -- finger puppet-making or drawing -- led by the resident Wave Hill artist Noah Baen. Hot chocolate and apple cider will be served afterward in front of a fire. Admission is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children.</p><p>Wave Hill is at 674 West 252d Street. Call (212) 549-3200 for more information.
