    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  For thousands of New York City residents with no high school degree, passing the equivalency test is the key to getting a job, getting off welfare or pursuing vocational or college studies. But educators who prepare people throughout the city for the test say the route is increasingly obstructed by delays and bureaucratic complications that put lives on hold for months or more.   Most commonly, the snag comes when people are ready to take the test, the General Educational Development, or G.E.D., exam, which is given nationally. After applying for seats at the exam they often must wait as long as six to eight months for reservations. 'An Absurd Situation'     A state education official who is charged with administering the test contends that the concern is being overstated, since students unable to take the test at a site that is too crowded can find other places that offer availability. But local officials, students and others familiar with the test argue that the problem is more severe: an unresponsive bureaucracy that refuses to address a shortage of slots.">

Now they are being asked to wait for months."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Such complaints are heard from a number of groups. They range from Promesa, a drug-rehabilitation program in the Bronx, to the Henry Street Settlement House in lower Manhattan, from the St. John the Baptist Parish Center in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn to District 65 of the United Auto Workers and the city's Human Resources Administration.</p><p>To a lesser degree, the complaints expressed in New York City have been voiced elsewhere, said Douglas Whitney, director of the G.E.D. testing service of the American Council on Education, which prepares the test given in all states.</p><p>"It appears to be one of the more serious problem locations, but there are problems elsewhere," he said in a telephone interview last night.</p><p>Noting that about half the states have no pre-registration process but offer the test on a walk-in basis, he said, "There are complaints about how long it takes to register in states with registration, even in those where the waiting period is much shorter than in New York, say four to six weeks."</p><p>For an individual student, the consequences of waiting months for the test, while skills grow rusty and confidence ebbs, can be severe. Educators say that delay can diminish the chances of passing, and failure can mean continued dependence on welfare. What impact that has on a city hoping to reduce its welfare and unemployment rolls is incalculable, for no one knows how many people fall by the wayside.</p><p>One of those who waited for six months before getting notification of a test date was Julia Medina, a single mother of five from the Red Hook section of Brooklyn who is on public assistance. "I was ready to take it in June when everything was fresh in my mind," said Miss Medina, who attended school only through the seventh grade but studied for three years at the Carroll Gardens Neighborhood Women's Adult Literacy Center.  A Missed Opportunity</p><p>An admission card for the exam arrived on Dec. 1. It told her to report to Sheepshead Bay High School on Dec. 5 for the seven-and-a-half-hour test, which is given over two days. "With so few days' notice, I just couldn't get anyone to stay with my children, so I didn't take it," she said. "I was very upset. I have been waiting so long."</p><p>Miss Medina, 37 years old, who dropped out of school 23 years ago after becoming pregnant through rape, is hoping to enroll in a nursing program at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. She cannot do that without her equivalency diploma.</p><p>Shirley Frederick, 30, another welfare mother in the group, who hopes to become a nurse, is in similar straits. "It's hard to focus on paper, hard to do homework after all these years," she said. "I've had the idea to give up, but when I watch my three kids I say I must keep going even when the door is slammed in my face." Ms. Frederick finally got a test date -- with two days' notice -- this month after waiting since spring. She was turned away when she arrived five minutes late because of a baby-sitting problem.</p><p>Students and administrators of G.E.D. courses report other problems, including difficulty getting in touch with people who set up the test appointments and a wait of 8 to 10 weeks for test results. In addition, allegations have been made that preferential treatment in the distribution of test seats is given to the Board of Education and the City University of New York, the largest providers of preparation classes in the city, leaving smaller groups scrambling for what remains.</p><p>But the officials of both the board and CUNY, which are able to reserve blocks of seats for the tests, say they also encounter difficulties securing enough spaces.</p>                </div>
