                    <p>The Alliance for Cultural Democracy, with headquarters in Minneapolis, will not be celebrating Christopher Columbus next year. Its members publish a quarterly newsletter, "Huracan," devoted to tracking official quincentennial ceremonies and listing alternatives. The alliance has for its symbol a drawing of a galleon with a red slash through it.</p><p>"Our perspective is what Columbus did to initiate the age of modern colonialism," said Ricardo Levins Morales, a founding member of the alliance. "As long as that history remains untaught," Mr. Morales said, "it's like the abusive family dynamic -- if the abuse is denied, the pattern of abuse is likely to continue."</p><p>The National Council of Churches is not far behind. Its members have voted to condemn Columbus's arrival as an "invasion" and plan to hold counter-demonstrations to the Catholic Church's plans for a celebration of 500 years of Christianity.</p><p>Christopher Columbus "symbolizes everything that is against basic American values," said Jack Weatherford, a professor of anthropology at Macalester College, in St. Paul, and a leading anti-Columbus scholar. Mr. Weatherford notes that Columbus never actually came to mainland North America (he landed in the Caribbean). He says that the navigator started the Atlantic slave trade and that his heroic status was a cynical invention of Washington Irving. Mr. Weatherford argues that after the war with the British in 1812, Americans were searching for a non-Anglo-Saxon national hero, and Irving served up Columbus.</p><p>In addition to the much ballyhooed novel "The Crown of Columbus," written by Louise Erdrich and her husband, Michael Dorris, two writers who tirelessly celebrate their American Indian ancestry, other revisionist works have appeared in anticipation of 1992.  In "The Conquest of Paradise," Kirkpatrick Sale stresses the explorer's legacy of environmental destructiveness -- and his lack of imagination. It seems that besides despoiling the New World, Columbus traveled like a trunk, failing to take any note of America's natural wonders. (His diary is peppered with such perfunctory descriptions as "big and little birds of all sorts.")</p><p>Anti-Columbus fervor on the left has, of course, unleashed a counterattack from the right. For conservatives, the heroine of the moment is Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, who denied a grant for a documentary called "1492: Clash of Visions," which unfavorably depicted Columbus and the Spanish conquistadors. Ms. Cheney complained that the film was not balanced, and criticized it in particular for dwelling on Spanish human rights violations while whitewashing the less attractive features of Aztec civilization, such as cannibalism. "Besides, Columbus never even    met    the Aztecs," she said.</p><p>Columbus's defenders have not been helped by the fact that John Goudie, the chairman of the presidential commission in charge of coordinating the international quincentennial, was forced to resign last year after reports of financial improprieties. (The commission and Spain are currently bickering over who will pick up the bill for the main event of 1992, an Atlantic crossing by replicas of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria.)</p><p>But the politicization of Columbus has obscured the fact that Columbus-bashing is a proud American tradition. One of the few facts schoolchildren retain about the explorer, besides the date of his voyage and the color of the ocean (blue), is that his discovery was a colossally mistaken search for a new route to India. Columbus's historic error has delighted generation after generation of snickering third graders.</p><p>The Encyclopedia Americana fastidiously credits the Italian navigator with leading "the first recorded European expedition to cross the Atlantic Ocean in warm or temperate climes," before quickly pointing out that he "was not the first European to land in the Americas."</p><p>There have always been those who think Columbus might have been Jewish, but the Encyclopedia Judaica does not seem eager to claim him. "He was himself mysterious about his background, which he wished to conceal," according to the entry on Columbus, "however, he boasted cryptically about his connection with King David." The encyclopedia lists some clues that have led scholars to believe Columbus was Jewish, then adds tartly, "The mystery regarding Columbus' origins is largely the outcome of his own mendacity."</p><p>Daniel J. Boorstin, librarian emeritus of the Library of Congress, does not appear to be all that impressed with Columbus, either. In his book, "The Discoverers," he repeatedly reminds his readers that Vasco da Gama was a much better sailor. He does grudgingly give Columbus points for "salesmanship." As Mr. Boorstin describes it, Columbus's wheedling around the court of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to peddle his pet project, "The Enterprise of the Indies," seems pathetic. The explorer comes off like some independent Hollywood producer desperately trying to pitch a movie deal to an all-powerful, indifferent studio.</p><p>The new Hollywood has bucked the revisionist fad and is unabashedly championing Columbus as a Renaissance Rambo. There are two competing big-budget Columbus productions. One features Timothy Dalton, the latest James Bond, as the explorer, and will be directed by George P. Cosmatos, who also directed "Rambo II." Mario Puzo wrote the screenplay. The film's producer, Ilya Salkind, produced the Superman movies.</p><p>The other movie, which will star the French actor Gerard Depardieu, is to be directed by Ridley Scott ("Alien"). Mr. Depardieu's Columbus is expected to have his wily moments, but like the Timothy Dalton version, he will be a heroic, larger-than-life figure. Patrick Wachsberger, president of Odyssey, the French company that is financing the Depardieu version, explained, "Nobody goes to the movies to see anything but a hero."</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
