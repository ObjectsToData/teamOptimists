The average price for rooms was $138.96 for the corresponding period in 1990.</p><p>"The group business and international tourists seem to be coming back, but not the domestic commercial business yet, because of the recession," said John A. Fox, a senior principal at Pannell Kerr Forster, the New York accounting firm that tracks hotel occupancy rates. "I think the summer will be lower than last year, but it depends on the economic recovery."  It's Big Business</p>                </div>

                    <p>The number of visitors to New York City is of far greater import than whether New Yorkers can hope to get a table at a fancy restaurant at the last minute or a ticket to a hot Broadway show. Tourism in New York is big business.</p><p>The estimated 25 million tourists who came to New York City in 1989, the most recent year for which figures are available, spent about $9 billion, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p><p>By the time that $9 billion wound its way through the local economy, causing other people to earn and spend more, the total economic impact of tourism was an estimated $12 billion. To put that in perspective, combined Wall Street salaries at their peak in the late 1980's were about $11 billion.</p><p>"It's one of the largest industries in the city," Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said of tourism. "It's extremely important."</p><p>Of the estimated 25 million tourists who come to New York City annually, domestic tourists outnumber foreign visitors four to one. So the 7 percent decline in domestic airport arrivals and the 5 percent decline in Amtrak arrivals from 1988 to 1990 -- many of whom are presumed to be domestic travelers -- have hurt New York's travel-related industries badly.  Softening the Blow</p><p>The continued influx of foreign tourists is all that is softening that blow. That is especially so because although overseas visitors make up only 20 percent of the total in numbers, they account for almost 40 percent of all spending.</p><p>Lufthansa German Airlines, for example, reported that since the end of February it has seen a 20 percent increase in passengers on its flights to New York from Frankfurt, compared with the same period last year.</p><p>International arrivals at La Guardia, Kennedy International Airport and Newark International Airport, were 5 percent higher in 1990 -- at 11.3 million -- than in 1988 -- at 10.8 million.</p><p>These two sides of tourism -- the enthusiastic foreigner and the reluctant American -- were reflected in the attitudes of two sets of tourists who were visiting Manhattan recently. Several teachers from the Midwest who were in town for a national debate competition said they found New York City crowded, dirty and expensive.  Not the 'Cheapest Town'</p><p>They did not intend to spend much while in New York, they said, and the advice from their hotel not to go out after 6 P.M. did little to ally their fears of crime.</p><p>New York is not "a place that people would put high on their list for a vacation," said Tom Clementi, a humanities teacher from Appleton, Wis.</p><p>"And the expense, too -- this isn't the world's cheapest town," he added.</p><p>The feeling appears to be different for foreign travelers.</p><p>Two Spanish visitors to Manhattan who had decided to stay in New York for a week after completing a business trip said they found New York inexpensive compared with their hometown of Madrid. And that seemed to outweigh any fleeting concerns about coming to personal harm.</p><p>"We've spent a lot of money," said Jose Luis Pastor, flashing a somewhat embarrassed smile.</p><p>The strength of foreign tourism is "strongly due to the favorable dollar -- more than anything else," said Kerstin Sabene, an assistant manager of public relations in Lufthansa's New York office, referring to the favorable exchange rates most foreign currencies receive in the United States. As for concerns about crime, "our German managers don't think it's a deterrent," she said.</p><p>A manager at Mamma Leone's, that mid-Manhattan bastion of pasta that draws so many visitors, reported that "foreign people are kicking back in now that the war is over." Conrad Bennett, the restaurant's director of operations, said, "It's equal to last year, though not better yet."</p><p>And Alfred J. Pettanati, the manager of the observation deck at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan is optimistic about attracting steady business from international tour groups this summer. When he was in Berlin in March, local tour operators began telling him that their telephones were finally beginning to ring again. About 50 percent of those who buy tickets to the deck are visitors from abroad, he said.</p><p>The growing importance of foreign tourists to New York has led some to call for the city to do more to make itself hospitable and "user-friendly" to visitors from abroad.</p><p>Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, says his research shows that the city is too expensive for most Americans and that they find many features of New York alien to their culture, preferring attractions like Disney World or the national parks instead.</p><p>Foreign visitors, by contrast, often come from large cities themselves and seem to be more tolerant of dirt and congestion and to take greater pleasure in dabbling in New York's activities, like eating, shopping and taking in cultural events.</p><p>New York City already draws about half of all Italians visiting the United States, more than 40 percent of all Spaniards visiting this country and more than a third of all French visitors, Convention and Visitors Bureau figures show.  'Enormous' Potential</p><p>Mr. Moss will urge in a forthcoming study on tourism that New York make itself easier for foreign visitors to consume, by making information more readily available in foreign languages, making it easier to change currencies and putting together special shopping or cultural tour packages, like baseball or golfing excursions for enthusiasts from Japan.</p><p>"The potential is enormous," said Mr. Moss.</p><p>The president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau, Marshall E. Murdaugh, could not agree more. Because it now receives a portion of the recently increased hotel tax, the bureau has been able to increase its sales force, open a Washington office and hire sales representatives in Tokyo, Frankfurt and London.</p><p>The fruits of that expansion can already be seen. New conventions booked through April of this year are expected to bring 186,980 delegates to the city in future years, compared with 89,945 delegates who were booked during that same period last year for future visits, Mr. Murdaugh said. While that will not have any impact on this summer's business, it is certainly good news for the future.</p><p>Photos: The nationwide recession is being blamed for a decline in the number of Americans visiting New York City this year, cutting the amount of tourist money being spent.
