Or is it a land where ethnicity should be celebrated over and above any shared heritage?</p><p>These were the questions that seemed to have most troubled the committee of 24 educators that has reviewed the curriculum and recommended broad principles for change.</p><p>In some ways the battle is as old as immigration to these shores. Irish, Italian and Jewish youngsters endlessly tangled with stubborn parents who wanted them to cling to the customs and faiths they had brought from the old country. The more ethnocentric scholars on the committee could well identify with the peddlers and shoemakers who doggedly fought off assimilation.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The peddlers and shoemakers, however, seldom demanded that their cultures be taught in the school curriculum. They believed that such instruction was a responsibility of family, community or houses of worship. New Perspectives</p><p>But as the number of black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian New Yorkers has grown to make up 31 percent of the state's population, many people from these minorities have been increasingly demanding that social studies include their cultures.</p><p>Further, many have called for a revision of the curriculum to reflect the perspectives they bring on issues like slavery and civil rights, views that sometimes clash with those that have been traditionally taught. Leaders of these groups say that unlike European immigrants of the past, they have not always been able to count on communal organizations, parochial schools or intact families to transmit heritage.</p><p>In sometimes stiff language, the report says: "There was a new recognition that the teaching of social studies as a single officially sanctioned story was inaccurate as to the facts of conflict in American history, and further, that it was limiting for white students and students of color alike."</p><p>Translating this ethnic assertiveness into a curriculum obligates the entire state to accept its world view, and that could lead inevitably to clashes with what has been assumed to be the dominant ethos. Overwhelmingly white communities in particular could resist a heightened emphasis on ethnic groups whose cultures they may consider remote.</p><p>But political clashes over curriculums are not new. The report itself points out that during the McCarthy era a greater emphasis was placed on "citizenship education" and American history. Mood of the Nation</p><p>The committee acknowledged, however ungrammatically, that the mood of the times has given impetus to its call for revision.</p><p>"Unlike earlier periods in the history of this country," it said, "the various people who make up our nation, while anxiously embracing many of the advantages, opportunities and mores of this society, seem determined to maintain and publicly celebrate as much of that which is peculiar to the cultures with which they identify."</p><p>Still, the committee's recommendations seem relatively innocuous given the extremes of the national debate over multicultural education. Its most controversial specifics call for replacing such terms as Oriental with Asian, Middle East with Southwest Asia and North Africa, slaves with enslaved persons and minorities with "part of the world's majorities."</p><p>But dissenters on the committee, like Dr. Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian, warn that a curriculum heavily focused on ethnicity opens the way for the kind of ethnic strife that has divided the Soviet Union, Canada, Yugoslavia and other nations where there is no consensus on a common culture.</p><p>The report, Dr. Jackson contends, has little to say about what holds Americans together, like its democratic ideals, however imperfectly observed. History, he says, has given Americans a culture that is mainly rooted in Britain but that has been greatly transformed by later tides of immigration. And this, for good or bad, he says, has become the American culture that people aspire to embrace.</p><p>"The people of the United States will recognize, even if this committee does not, that every viable nation has to have a common culture to survive in peace," he wrote in a dissent.</p><p>A vivid example of the possibilities for ethnic turmoil was in the report itself. A committee member, Ali A. Mazrui, a humanities professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton, wrote what he called a six-page "annex" in which he argued that the term "holocaust" should not be reserved to describe the murder of six million Jews in World War II. Instead, he said, the term should "remain a generic metaphor" that can apply as well to the oppression of American Indians and black slaves.</p><p>If incorporated into the curriculum, such arguments are sure to anger Elie Wiesel and other leaders of Jewish organizations who contend that the Nazi's systematic effort to eradicate Jews is unparalleled.</p><p>The State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, argues that a middle ground has to be found between a sharing of American values and an appreciation of American diversity. "I do not believe those two purposes are incompatible," he said.</p><p>The question is whether the curriculum writers he is likely to appoint can avoid the ideological and ethnic friction that would almost certainly arise if these principles are incorporated in a social studies curriculum.</p><p>An alternative view was also expressed by another committee member, the Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer, a co-author of the seminal book "Beyond the Melting Pot," which argues that America's melting pot ideal is a myth. In a comment appended to the committee's report, he warned that a new syllabus runs the danger of bestowing on ethnic groups a uniformity that may also be mythical. Each of these groups, he said, is fragmented by class, intermarriage and degree of assimilation.</p><p>Professor Glazer left an implicit suggestion that any syllabus needs to move away from a preoccupation with ethnicity to the affirmation of another American value that the report scarcely mentions: the importance of the individual.</p><p>Chart: 'Voices From the Committee'    Reflections on the report from members of the social studies sylabus review committee. From the Chairmen: Edmund Gordon Professor of psychology, Yale University. Francis Roberts Superintendent, Cold Spring Harbor School District    "The question arises as to whether we can conjointly serve both pluribus and unum. The consensus arrived at in this committee suggest that we can....What should be celebrated in the remarkable achievements that now symbolize modernity are the accomplishments of the human species, built one upon the other, of centuries of human conceptual and technological developments." Lloyd Elm Superintendent, Buffalo public schools    "A complete education, whatever that means to individuals, no longer means that individuals must sacrifice their ethnic identity." Nathan Glazer Professor of sociology, Harvard University    "The report does reject two extremes in the treatment of ethnic and racial diversity in American social studies; One is the emphasis on forceful Americanization and assimilation that characterized much of American public education during the period of the great European immigration and for some time after. The other is the parceling out of American history into a different and incompatible story for each group, generally told by a few activists and militants...a vision which seemed to be advocated in a earlier report" Diane Glover Teacher, P.S. 40, Queens    "The topic of racism can no longer be a taboo, if we want an effective multicultural curriculum....The educational community needs to know the devastating psychological damage that has been inflicted upon members of the African Diaspora....They need to know the role of European scholarship in promoting psychological and historical inferiority. A Dissent: Kenneth T. Jackson Professor of history and social studies, Columbia University.    "The report highlights the notion that all cultures are created equal. This may be true in the abstract, and i have no problem with the philosophical concept. But I cannot endorse a 'Declaration of Cultural Interdependence'....Within any single country, one culture must be accepted as the standard. Unfortunately, our document has very little to say about the things which hold us together...The emphasis is too much on the pluribus and not enough on the unum.</p>                </div>
