                    <p>THE "Roaring Twenties" was a boom time for Westchester County as a whole, and especially for areas along the Bronx River Parkway, which was completed in 1925.</p><p>On weekends, drivers streamed up from New York City in search of speakeasies and other attractions; soon they began settling into the apartment buildings cropping up along the parkway.</p><p>A chief beneficiary of this was the Fleetwood neighborhood in the city of Mount Vernon, which has had its own train station since the early 1900's. In the 20's, there was a building boom, with apartment houses rising near the station and one-family homes on outlying streets. By the 40's, little land was left.</p><p>Then, as now, the area was populated primarily by commuters into Manhattan. Every weekday morning, a phalanx of briefcase carriers streams out of apartment buildings on Broad Street as young professionals head for trains to Manhattan. In other parts of Fleetwood, with more classically suburban tree-lined streets, people are more likely to drive than take the train.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Carole and Raymond Hickey, for example, have lived in the neighborhood for 16 years and "rarely take the train," said Mrs. Hickey. Her husband is a vice president of manufacturing for Chock Full O' Nuts Coffee Company and has to travel around the metropolitan area to inspect plants. "This is the perfect location for us," she said. "His driving time would be ridiculous if we lived any farther north."</p><p>One of the things that attracted the Hickeys, who bought a 1921 center-hall colonial, was the diversity of housing. The homes, unlike those in other suburban areas, were built one at a time, and almost every style is available, with colonials, Tudors and Victorians predominating. Prices vary, too, from $215,000 for a small three-bedroom to $799,900 for an eight-bedroom on several acres.</p><p>Fleetwood's neighbor to the north is the affluent village of Bronxville. "As you get closer to that line, the houses tend to get more spread out and expensive," said Errol McIntosh, the city's Commissioner of Buildings. Although houses may look the same as those in Bronxville, their Mount Vernon zip code makes them considerably less expensive, brokers say.</p><p>"You can get a comparable house here for $100,000 less than in Bronxville," said Liz Lindsey of Liz Lindsey Real Estate.</p><p>Before 1850, Fleetwood was the name of a farm owned by Jonas Farrington. In 1853, he and another farmer sold 94 acres to John Stevens, president of American Home Association No. 1. Stevens "divided the land up into 50- by 100- plots, and put huge houses on them" said Shannon Chandley, curator of the local history room of the Mount Vernon Public Library. "Most of the people moving up here were from the city, so I guess to them it seemed like a lot of land."</p><p>ALL but three apartment houses have been converted to co-ops. Their prices range from $35,000 for a one-bedroom to $179,500 for a three-bedroom. Rentals range from $725 a month for a one-bedroom to $925 for a three-bedroom.</p><p>One co-op complex that, brokers say, has proven popular with West Siders from Manhattan is Park Lane. Built in 1928, it was originally advertised as having "Country-Home Apartments." Its four buildings occupy a large part of the estate built at the turn of the century by James A. Bailey, a founder of the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. Each apartment has a fireplace, 9- to 12-foot ceilings, a sun porch, pantry and other old-time touches.</p><p>Apartments there -- and several are currently available -- range from $85,000 for a one-bedroom to $179,500 for three bedrooms. Arthur Murray once lived there. It is said that he knocked down a wall to enlarge a room to make it more suitable for ballroom dancing.</p><p>While there has not been much building in recent years, the area's first and only condominium complex, Fleetwood Glen, was built across from the train tracks in 1989. It is over 60 percent sold, according to Donna Galdstein, a broker with Fleetwood Realty. Prices range from $150,000 for a one-bedroom to $200,000 for two bedrooms. There is an indoor pool and a spa and health club. The Mayor of Mount Vernon, Ronald A. Blackwood, lives there.</p><p>One of most controversial issues facing him is the quality of the school system, which is considered very good or very bad, depending on who is asked. Mount Vernon had among the lowest S.A.T. scores in Westchester County in 1990. Only 59.1 percent of its students go on to college, compared with 100 percent in Bronxville.</p><p>Many people believe those numbers reflect not so much the quality of the education as the diverse student body. As in most cities, there are many disadvantaged students in Mount Vernon.</p><p>Fleetwood residents can send their children to one of four elementary schools: Pennington Grimes, Lincoln, Columbus or Trap Hagen. Pennington Grimes is considered the most desirable because it is the closest to Bronxville.</p><p>After grade 6, students attend one of two middle schools: Alfred M. Franko, a magnet school specializing in math and science, and the A. B. Davis, specializing in law, management, business awareness and global studies. All attend Mount Vernon High School.</p><p>"At first, I was concerned that the middle school would be too big and overwhelming for my daughter," said Alfred J. DiMaio, chairman of the political science department and director of social studies at Long Island University in Brooklyn. "But she wanted to stay, and last June she graduated from the high school." Nina DiMaio is now at the University of Chicago.</p><p>ONE of the district's offerings that most impressed Mr. DiMaio is its humanities program, an integrated curriculum, starting at the elementary level, where all courses focus on one theme. "If a child is studying dinosaurs in social studies, for example, then his science class would be about archeology," said William C. Pratella, superintendent of schools. "And in music class, students would sing about dinosaurs and paint them in art class, and so on." A student can elect to stay in this program throughout his or her school years.</p><p>In addition to the district schools there are the Roman Catholic St. Peter and Paul's Elementary and High Schools.</p><p>Fleetwood's main commercial strip is Gramatan Avenue, which has clothing boutiques, shops and restaurants. A supermarket is nearby, with more extensive shopping available at the Cross County Shopping Center and the Vernon Hills center on Route 22.</p><p>For a combination of dining and entertainment, residents can go to the Bayou on Gramatan, which serves Cajun cuisine and offers live music every Thursday night, featuring Delta Blues performers. Another popular restaurant is the newly opened Athena, a high-tech Greek diner.</p><p>There used to be a moviehouse on Gramatan Avenue, but it closed. Many residents now go to the movies at Bronxville's three-screen theater. "The one thing we could really use is a movie theater," said Carol Richards Mermey, a freelance writer who moved from Manhattan's West Side four years ago.</p><p>The Mount Vernon Department of Recreation offers men's and women's softball and touch football leagues, and youth and adult tennis programs. There are six tennis courts at the high school and 11 at the city's parks. The only open green field near Fleetwood is Hartley Park, in the center of the city. It has two basketball courts, a volleyball and bocce court and a gazebo for summer concerts.</p><p>Photo: House on Stuyvesant Plaza; First Presbyterian Church on Columbus Avenue.

Jazz Sundays: Every second Sunday of the month, from September to April, a room at the First Presbyterian Church of Mount Vernon is transformed into a jazz nightclub. Among recent performers have been Clark Terry and Freddie Cole (Nat King Cole's brother). The program is run by the Presbyterian Jazz Society, founded 11 years ago by the Rev. Clinton Glenn to provide a forum for jazz and encourage young talent. One hour is set aside before each concert for young musicians, and the society has given several scholarships to students at the Mount Vernon Music Academy, which is affiliated with the church. Performances are from 6 to 9 P.M. Admission is $12 at the door. Map of Fleetwood</p>                </div>
