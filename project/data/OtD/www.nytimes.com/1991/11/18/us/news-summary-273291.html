A8  KHMER ROUGE IS BACK     The Khmer Rouge returned to the Cambodian capital in the person of Son Sen, who served as head of a genocidal army in the 1970's. His arrival traumatized the city.  A1  RUSSIA STAKES ITS CLAIM    With a burst of decrees, Boris N. Yeltsin moved to assert the Russian republic's dominance over the Soviet economy. Russia proclaimed control over its dwindling oil and gold reserves and lifted most controls over imports, exports and foreign currency transactions.  A1  KURDISH CITY ON THE MEND     Halabja Journal: After a long and forced exile, Iraqi Kurds are returning to the scene of the worst chemical attack on civilians of the eight-year war with Iran.

Few expect an easing of social constraints in the Islamic kingdom.

News Analysis: David Duke gained a national forum and a national network of financial support, but his overwhelming defeat also shows that he is now &quot;damaged goods.&quot; B6  No hidden vote for Duke.

	data-description="  International A3-9  CHINA OFFERS BAKER LITTLE     Three days of talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Beijing's leaders yielded some limited Chinese gestures to curb missile sales, but little progress toward easing political repression.  Page A1  China detains two more dissidents over the weekend.  A8  KHMER ROUGE IS BACK     The Khmer Rouge returned to the Cambodian capital in the person of Son Sen, who served as head of a genocidal army in the 1970's. His arrival traumatized the city.  A1  RUSSIA STAKES ITS CLAIM    With a burst of decrees, Boris N. Yeltsin moved to assert the Russian republic's dominance over the Soviet economy. Russia proclaimed control over its dwindling oil and gold reserves and lifted most controls over imports, exports and foreign currency transactions.  A1  KURDISH CITY ON THE MEND     Halabja Journal: After a long and forced exile, Iraqi Kurds are returning to the scene of the worst chemical attack on civilians of the eight-year war with Iran.  A4  SAUDIS PLEDGE REFORMS     King Fahd promised a series of changes in his Government by January, including a new citizen's council to advise the monarchy. Few expect an easing of social constraints in the Islamic kingdom.  A3  CROATIAN STRONGHOLD FALLS     The Croatian republic conceded the loss of Vukovar, a cherished town on the Danube, to Yugoslav federal forces. Croats pleaded with the army to guarantee the safety of thousands of civilians huddled in cellars beneath the city's ruins.  A3  TURKEY SEEKS NEW IDENTITY     With an inflation rate of 70 percent and its borders threatened, Turkey is scrambling to redefine itself after the election defeat of the pro-Western governing party.  A6  WONDERING ABOUT MAXWELL     Almost two weeks after his mysterious death, detectives are still seeking a definitive explanation of how the British publisher's body ended up in the ocean.  A9  National A10-13, B6-7  WRITING AND REWRITING HISTORY     As shown in the dispute over the 1991 Civil Rights Bill, an arcane bit of Washington life, the legislative history of a bill, has taken on new importance.  A1  MISSILE SYSTEM ADVANCES     Though Congress is near approval of a new anti-missile system for the first time in 25 years, questions remain about it utility and cost.  A1  AFTER THE ELECTION     Edwin W. Edwards basks in his unexpectedly lopsided victory over David Duke to be the next Governor of Louisiana.  A1  Bitter election campaign ends, racial divisiveness remains.  B6  WHAT NEXT FOR DUKE?     News Analysis: David Duke gained a national forum and a national network of financial support, but his overwhelming defeat also shows that he is now "damaged goods." B6  No hidden vote for Duke.  B7  WORRIES FOR REPUBLICANS     News Analysis: President Bush's political fortunes have quickly deteriorated, and many Republicans worry whether Mr. Bush and his political team can adjust in time to salvage the '92 election.  A10  AFTER THE NUCLEAR CATACLYSM     In the early years of the Reagan Administration a secret Federal agency established a line of succession to the President outside the Constitution to assure continued government in the event of a devastating nuclear attack.  A12  TURNING POINT FOR WOMEN     Just when the times have become favorable to national discussion of their traditional issues, female lawmakers are learning that being on the inside politically also has a down side.  B7  PAYING FOR A POLITICAL RACE     A new study supports the charge that major political donors are bypassing Federal limits on direct contributions to candidates by pumping money into state parties that then help Federal candidates through voter registration drives and other efforts.  B7  WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE     For the people of Fir Island, Wash., destructive floods just part of making their personal peace with the elements in the wettest corner of the United States.  A10  Countdown for a shuttle launching begins.  A10  Metropolitan Digest, B1 BLACK CHURCHES FACE AIDS     Haltingly, black churches and mosques nationwide are beginning to turn to the fight against AIDS. Forced to recognize that blacks account for an alarming proportion of cases, the black clergy is speaking out in sermons and starting counseling and support groups.
