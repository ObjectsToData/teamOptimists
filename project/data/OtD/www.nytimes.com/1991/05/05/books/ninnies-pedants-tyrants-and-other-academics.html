Twenty years have passed, and many of us, through folly, hubris or mischance, have died or been left sleeping in the land of the lotus-eaters.

The idea of expertise in any one area of the humanities, with its subsequent phenomenon of faculty recruitment by time-framed slots, was always mistaken. It was inspired, in this masculine pioneer country that has never taken the arts seriously, by nervous emulation of the sciences, where one can indeed deeply and profitably specialize in moths, ferns or igneous rocks. But there is no true expertise in the humanities without knowing    all    of the humanities. Art is a vast, ancient interconnected web-work, a fabricated tradition. Overconcentration on any one point is a distortion.</p><p>This is one of the primary reasons for the dullness and ineptitude of so much 20th-century criticism, as compared to 19th-century belles-lettres. American professors have been institutionally impelled, by graduate education and then by the universities that employ them, to become narrower and narrower. The goal of comprehensive cultural vision predicated by German philology, which esteemed universal scholarship, has been dismissed as unrealistic in a modern alienated world of fragmentation and subjectivity. But the old German style -- sober, practical, precise, lucid and learned -- is exactly what is needed to remedy today's confusions and excesses. Only small minds fail to see patterns and wholes.</p><p>Both undergraduate education and commentary on the arts require teachers and scholars who understand the history of civilization in broad, general terms. Hollywood Bible movies of the 50's, like "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben-Hur," with their epic clash of pagan and Judeo-Christian cultures, tell more truth about art and society than the French-infatuated ideologues who have made a travesty of the best American higher education. For 15 years, fast-track American academics have neglected scholarship and learning to chase down the cul-de-sac of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913), whose flawed system of linguistics underlies the work of Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, as well as their Parisian disciples, Julia Kristeva and the overpraised feminist propagandists Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Lacan was a psychoanalyst, untrained in history, whose tediously obscurantist work is simply a malicious gloss on the far greater Freud. Derrida is a Heideggerian philosopher who has convinced gullible academics that there is no meaning or order in history and that every literary text collapses into self-devouring fragments. Foucault was a radical professor of modern intellectual history who was ignorant of anything before the Enlightenment and outside of France; yet he claimed to discover the secret authoritarian codes in civilization that brainwash us into sexual and social conformity. These minor French theorists have had a disastrous effect on American education. Lacan encourages pompous bombast and Foucault teaches cheap cynicism, while Derrida's aggressive method, called deconstruction, systematically trashes high culture by reducing everything to language and then making language destroy itself. The entire school of Saussure is in a state of faddish delusion about life, art and thought.</p><p>In "Tenured Radicals," which treats trendy showboating professors with the irreverence they deserve, Roger Kimball makes one statement I would correct -- he suggests that the radicals of the 60's are now in positions of control in the major universities. He is too generous. Most of this country's academic leftists are no more radical than my Aunt Hattie. Sixties radicals rarely went on to graduate school; if they did, they often dropped out. If they made it through, they had trouble getting a job and keeping it. They remain mavericks, isolated, off-center. Today's academic leftists are strutting wannabes, timorous nerds who missed the 60's while they were grade-grubbing in the library and brown-nosing the senior faculty. Their politics came to them late, secondhand and special delivery via the Parisian import craze of the 70's.</p><p>These people have risen to the top not by challenging the system but by smoothly adapting themselves to it. They are company men, Rosencrantzes and Guildensterns, privileged opportunists who rode the wave of fashion. Most true 60's people could not and largely did not survive in the stifling graduate schools of the late 60's and early 70's.</p><p>The followers of Lacan, Derrida and Foucault, far from being political and intellectual sophisticates, are the real fossilized reactionaries of our time. They seized on and dogged to death ideas that were totally passe in the United States well before 1970. Foucault spoke of Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" as the pivotal liberating experience of his generation of Parisians, who were emerging from existentialism. When I saw that play in 1966 in college, I recognized it as a repressive anxiety-formation of defunct modernism, which the 60's revolution, energized by rock music, had swept completely away. At that moment in America, popular culture -- rude, vital, brassy -- had triumphed. Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg, reanimating the commercial motifs of our daily life, had killed the European avant-garde forever.</p>                </div>
