                    <p>ONCE upon a time, women assumed that when they became a force in the workplace, they would be judged on their merits rather than their appearance.</p><p>But three decades after the dawn of liberation, things have not exactly worked out that way. Indeed, the more successful women have become in infiltrating the male-dominated sphere, the more their looks, clothing and grooming have inspired discussion, litigation and even obsession.</p><p>There is a stormy debate right now among American women writers and academics about the connection between looks and economic progress, about whether it is all right for feminists to enjoy wearing lipstick and shopping for sensual clothes, about whether women have victimized themselves by inculcating an artificial MTV-Madison Avenue-Vogue standard of youth and beauty that sabotages their ascension in the marketplace.</p><p>In her controversial new polemic, "The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women" (William Morrow &amp; Company), Naomi Wolf argues that women have taken on a third shift in their lives: Now they work, they take care of the home, and they try to live up to "the dream language of meritocracy" put forward in women's magazines. ("A gorgeous figure doesn't come without effort," "You can totally reshape your body," "Your facial lines are now within your control.")</p>                </div>

                    <p>Ms. Wolf, a Rhodes scholar and recent Yale graduate, writes about the exploitation and obsession fed by a $20 billion-a-year cosmetics industry, a $33 billion diet industry, a $300 million cosmetic-surgery industry and a $7 billion pornography industry.</p><p>Historically, a woman's worth in society has been defined by her youth and beauty. Now, Ms. Wolf and others argue, that standard has been applied to the work place, so that women must compete both romantically and professionally in terms of appearance.</p><p>Gloria Steinem, who took a job in the early 1960's as a Playboy Bunny to write an article, came to the conclusion that "All women are Bunnies." Ms. Wolf says that greater success in the office has done nothing to change that equation.</p><p>"The working woman was told she had to think about 'beauty' in a way that undermined, step for step, the way she had begun to think as a result of the successes of the women's movement," Ms. Wolf writes. "The closer women come to power, the more physical self-consciousness and sacrifice are asked of them." Darned If You Don't</p><p>Ms. Wolf's premise, considered naive and wrongheaded by some feminists and ground-breaking and brilliant by others, was underscored by a couple of events in the news recently.</p><p>In the first, Continental Airlines fired Teresa Fischette from her part-time job at the ticket counter at Boston's Logan International Airport after she refused to comply with the company directive on wearing makeup. After a furor ensued, Continental hired back Ms. Fischette and said that from now on, compliance with the 45-page appearance code would be suggested rather than mandatory.</p><p>And The Wall Street Journal reported last week that United States District Judge E. B. Haltom dismissed a suit by a woman who said she lost her job after spurning her boss. The judge sided with the defendant after considering the evidence, which included a picture of the boss's wife to contrast with the plaintiff. His opinion noted that the former employee "wore little or no makeup and her hair was not colored in any way" and therefore, she "was not attractive" to the boss.</p><p>In Judge Haltom's view, a woman does not merit sexual harassment if she has not devoted enough time and attention to adorning herself. Of course, if she has, she is vulnerable to the argument that she "asked for" indecent attention from the men in her office or men on the street.</p><p>If women are penalized for not looking feminine enough, they are also penalized for looking too feminine. In her book, Ms. Wolf cites several legal cases, including that of a San Francisco policewoman, Nancy Fahdl, who was dismissed because she looked "too much like a lady," and Diaz v. Coleman, in which a dress code of short skirts was set by an employer who allegedly sexually harassed his female employees.</p><p>It is, to say the least, a confusing time for professional women.</p><p>In the late 1970's, when women were beginning to be assimilated into corporations in large numbers, their bible was John T. Molloy's "Dress for Success." Mr. Molloy believed that women should adopt a masculine uniform, like navy blue suits, little bow ties and oxford shirts, as a way of suppressing distracting sexuality and gaining an equal footing with respect to image.</p><p>But as women grew more confident, they stopped emulating men in dress. A Double-Edged Sword</p><p>Many professional women say that dressing with a hint of flirtatiousness, in softly cut silks and satins and cashmeres, has made them feel more powerful, because they can express themselves as individuals rather than camouflaging themselves to look like men. But it is a double-edged sword since studies find that most women who are harassed feel guilty and blame themselves for provoking the comments by dressing "inappropriately."</p><p>Ms. Wolf asserts that the fashion industry helped scuttle Mr. Malloy's movement, to the detriment of women. "The consequence of men wearing uniforms where women do not has simply meant that women take on the full penalties as well as the pleasures of physical charm in the workplace, and can legally be punished or promoted, insulted or even raped accordingly," she writes.</p><p>Camille Paglia, a professor of humanities at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and the author of "Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson," calls Ms. Wolf's book "a shabby mess" that reinforces American puritanical tendencies.</p><p>"Women enjoy color and fabric and fashion and we should not have to apologize for that," Ms. Paglia said. "American feminism has gotten itself in a corner, because it is unable to explain the attraction of women to beauty and pleasure and sexuality."</p><p>Ms. Paglia said that it was an ironic surprise to feminists who felt that they were "going to make a perfect world where people would no longer be judged by beauty or talent" to find that "maybe the problems between the sexes can not be solved by passing more regulations."</p><p>In a recent issue of Allure magazine, Betty Friedan argues that it is not wrong for feminists to want to be beautiful. "Women could all stop wearing lipstick and blusher, eye shadow and moisturizing cream tomorrow, and I doubt it would help them break through the glass ceiling or get child care or parental leave within the structures of the workplace," she said, adding: "If feminism really meant a war against men -- a repudiation of love and beauty and home and children -- most women would not want it."</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Wolf said that her aim is not to tell women how to look; her aim is simply to get rid of the double standard and make sure that women are not demoted or harassed because of their appearance.</p><p>"Only women are told 'You've got a choice: you can either be sexual or serious,' " she said. "With men, their seriousness enhances their sexuality. When you tell a woman she must choose, you disempower her. Because it is human to be both sexual and serious."</p><p>Photo of two women putting on makeup.
