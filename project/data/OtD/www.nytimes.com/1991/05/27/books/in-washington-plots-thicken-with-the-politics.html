Cohen.</p><p>His latest thriller, "One-Eye Kings," which was published this month by Doubleday, includes all the major ingredients for a good read: an assassinated senator, a beautiful Mossad agent, sexual liaisons, intrigue in the White House and the Kremlin and dastardly deeds all around.</p><p>It is a world that Senator Cohen knows well, having served on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and Armed Services Committee. Senator Cohen's detailed descriptions of covert programs and security arcana lend his novel the ring of truth.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Aspects of the plot were triggered by the Iran-contra affair, Senator Cohen said, but the machinations were of his own creation. "It obviously springs from my own experience," he said. "But there is nothing in the book that deals with existing programs."  Fiction, or Not?</p><p>Senator Cohen has written two volumes of poetry and has co-written an espionage novel, "The Double Man," with former Senator Gary Hart along with a book on the Iran-contra hearings with his fellow Senator from Maine, George J. Mitchell. Although Senator Cohen said his latest venture was "fiction, pure fiction," he added with a smile, "I have three colleagues who think the book is about them."</p><p>Senator Cohen is just one of Washington's insiders whose power base helps to feed their muse. Although memoirs are Washington's stock in trade, some choose to tell their tales through fiction.</p><p>"The experiences I had working in politics have taken me literally from the Oval Office to Mrs. Thatcher's sitting room at No. 10 Downing Street, all settings a novelist would pay money to have access to," said John Buckley, who was President Ronald Reagan's press secretary in the 1984 re-election campaign and Jack F.  Kemp's press secretary in Congress.</p><p>His novel "Statute of Limitations" centers on a White House speech writer who is blackmailed into smuggling drugs on Air Force One. "If you work in politics and have a novelistic eye and, more importantly, a novelistic ear," Mr. Buckley said, "there is a wealth of material that begs you to write about it." A Novel Beckons</p><p>Marilyn Quayle has discovered this as well. She and Nancy Northcott, her sister, have been working on a novel to be published in early 1992 by Crown. The book is at the rewriting stage, said Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer and Mrs. Quayle's literary agent. At a recent luncheon at the Vice Presidential mansion, Mrs. Quayle told Mr. Barnett that her sister was "upstairs, hard at work."</p><p>Mrs. Quayle said she preferred not to discuss the book because to do so would be premature. But it is a tale about the last battle between the superpowers with the focus on Cuba, Mr. Barnett said. President Fidel Castro reportedly dies in the first chapter.</p><p>Marilyn Sharp, the author of three spy novels with Washington backdrops, in one book planned to knock off a secret ex-Nazi in the men's bathroom at the White House. So she dispatched her husband, Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, for a bit of legwork. "He came out and said, 'It's white,' and I told him I needed more than that and sent him back in," she said with a chuckle. "He was much better on his second assignment: he gave me a wonderfully detailed description about Air Force One after a trip back to Indiana with President Carter."</p><p>Mrs. Sharp is working on a fourth novel, which is set in Washington and the Soviet Union. Her first novel, "Sunflower," about the kidnapping of a President, sold for $500,000 for the American paperback rights. "I think people are intrigued by the power that resides here," she said of Washington. "What originally interested me about writing spy novels was the secrecy of the C.I.A., the K.G.B., the F.B.I. It is such an easy arena for abuse, and I like to conjure up things that can happen when people operating in secrecy get out of control." 'Reality Overtakes You'</p><p>Lynne V. Cheney, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has written two novels and a nonfiction book about Capitol Hill with her husband, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Of writing a political novel, she said, "Reality overtakes you, and the reality is so interesting that if you try to make fiction keep up with reality, then the novel starts to seem strained."</p><p>One way to handle this, she suggested, is through satire.</p><p>"The Body Politic," a novel that Mrs. Cheney wrote with Vic Gold, a former speech writer for President Bush, and that Orion Films has bought, satirizes the political scene with a tale of a Vice President who dies without anybody noticing.</p><p>William D. Pease, a former assistant United States Attorney in Washington, wrote "Playing the Dozens," a novel about political corruption in the District of Columbia, which was published by Viking in September. He has a contract for a second novel.  A number of Washington journalists have also turned to fiction. David Wise, a former reporter for The New York Herald Tribune who has written extensively about the Central Intelligence Agency, has produced three novels whose plots were inspired by events at the agency. The former Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn, who wrote "Regrets Only," a roman a clef about life in Washington, has written another novel, to be published in the fall.</p><p>Former C.I.A. employees must have all their published books cleared by the agency, even their novels, said William Hood, who was an official at the agency for 30 years. "I've never had any trouble," said Mr. Hood, whose latest novel, "Sunday Spy," is to be published by W. .W. Norton .</p><p>Patrick Anderson, who has written eight novels, a number of which are set in Washington, served in the Kennedy Justice Department and wrote speeches for President Jimmy Carter. Washington insiders, he said, "tend to write about process, which is what they know, rather than about people, which is what fiction is about." "That's why you have a lot of bad Washington novels," he said.</p><p>Catherine Mann, who was a television reporter on "Entertainment Tonight" before marrying Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa, has used both Washington and Hollywood for her three novels.  "Washington is a marvelous backdrop and in many ways similar to Hollywood, but with higher ceilings," she said. "They are both company towns and the characters are very similar, except that in Hollywood they wear open shirts and flashy jump suits."</p><p>Her new novel, 'Capitol Hill," is to be published in September by Dell. Its main characters are two women who live on the Hill. "There's enough skulduggery to go around," Ms. Mann said.</p><p>Photos: Senator William S. Cohen and Lynne V.
