                    <p>Hanna's, at 27-29 Nassau Street, has large windows and high ceilings that give the place an airy feeling. There is a sense that there is no rush getting to know the books, and that no eager clerk is going to intrude. On any day, Mr. Hanna said, the browsers among the 90,000 titles in stock include the poets Seamus Heaney or Brendan Kennelly, the novelists Edna O'Brien, Derwood Bolger or John McGahern. Competitors, he said, have perhaps 25,000 titles.</p><p>The literary taste of the Irish, Mr. Hanna said, falls into the usual three brows. A visitor can easily find the work of second-rate poets and hack novelists. But the emphasis the shop prefers is clear from the display window, where there is almost always some Joyce. Last summer, here lay an outsized $530 early edition of "Ulysses," one of the few of its kind in the world. He had sold more than 20 of them in the last five years, Mr. Hanna said. Some of the Joyce business is with tourists, and students at summer Joyce courses and celebrants of Bloom's Day on June 16, but the master still sells well with his own people.</p><p>"It never was officially banned here," Mr. Hanna said of "Ulysses." "We did our own censorship," he said of booksellers. "Publishers representatives would say 'you wouldn't want it' -- librarians would buy off our shelves and they would be very annoyed if we sold them something objectionable." But mores, still heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, have changed. Playboy is nowhere to be found in public, nor is pornography of any core. But Philip Roth is no longer banned, nor are Sean O'Faolain, Mary Lavin, Elizabeth Bowen. Sweeping his hand over the fiction section, Mr. Hanna said, "all these people had at least one story banned." But, he said, "minds have broadened through television. There is no point banning a bedroom scene in a book if you can get it on television."</p><p>One of the ways he keeps Hanna's reputation high, he said, is the proper training of clerks, whose number now includes Mr. Heaney's son, Michael. Essentially, the clerks are taught to "never say you don't know" when a customer asks about a book, and to learn fast where things are. Other stores, Mr. Hanna said, will cover ignorance by saying "we just sold the last copy, or it's out of print. Our motto is tell the truth, shame the devil."</p><p>Among the classic Irish writers, Yeats sells well, Mr. Hanna said, adding, "We used to sell Yeats as remainders." Then, looking over several thousand of his classic titles in one corner, he said, "Once these people die, they come into vogue. That's a sad thing."</p><p>The stock ranges from best sellers in hard and soft covers to rows and rows of travel books, maps and language (including Irish) manuals. And to those who joke that an Irish seven-course meal comprises a six pack and a boiled potato, there is a section of cookbooks. There are also splendid art books covering, among other subjects, the exquisite Book of Kells illustrations of biblical texts. (The originals are across the street, for public viewing, at Trinity College.) Also, there are books of tales and mythology covering leprechauns and the ancient kings and queens. People interested in tracing their roots to the royal O'Neills or Tyrones, or humbler ancestors, will find dozens of books and pamphlets. There is one hint of artistic mystery in the store: Going out of print fast, Mr. Hanna said, were line-drawing caricatures on postcards depicting Joyce, Yeats, Wilde and Beckett. Ten years ago, an American artist named Ingersoll said he was giving up residence in Ireland and he sold Mr. Hanna a large supply of the cards he had made. Now the Joyces are gone, and the others are dwindling down to the mere hundreds. Mr. Hanna is not sure whether Ingersoll is still alive, whether he should reproduce the cards, not known to exist elsewhere in Ireland.</p><p>Kenny's, across the country in High Street, a short, easy-to-find shopping lane in the middle of Galway -- a clean, prosperous, old-looking city of 40,000 where people angle for healthy fish in the Corrib River right in the middle of town -- was opened in 1940 by the parents of Desmond Kenny and his sister and four brothers. They still run the business, too busy keeping track of its 150,000 titles and growing art gallery to complain about much.</p><p>"Mother came to University College to study commerce. Father was studying humanities," said Mr. Kenny. "There was no work in Galway, and they didn't want to emigrate, so they started a book shop in a rented room." The present shop has three floors, low ceilings and narrow staircases that stagger up into rooms crammed with tens of thousands of out-of-print books. Mr. Kenny pointed to a top-shelf collection of the dusty-looking humorous novels and critical essays of George A. Birmingham, a politically controversial author of the first third of the century who became a friend of Graham Greene when Greene spent summers in western Ireland, then became a Kenny's customer, ordering by mail.</p>                </div>
