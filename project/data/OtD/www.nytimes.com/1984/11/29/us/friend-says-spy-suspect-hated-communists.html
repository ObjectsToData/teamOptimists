Koecher was a militant anti-Communist refugee from Czechoslovakia, a sharp-tempered debater who vigorously supported conservative causes.     His wife, Hana, was less outspoken, but at dinner and at cocktail parties, she was a staunch supporter of her husband's anti-Soviet stands.    Yesterday, in a courtroom at the United States Court House on Foley Square, Mr. Koecher was formally charged with infiltrating the Central Intelligence Agency as a spy for the Czechoslovak intelligence service and turning over classified C.I.A. information to the Czechoslovaks.   Mrs. Koecher, who was arrested with her husband on Tuesday, just hours before they were to fly to Europe, is being held as a material witness. According to an affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, she was an espionage courier for her husband.">

                    Yesterday, in a courtroom at the United States Court House on Foley Square, Mr. Koecher was formally charged with infiltrating the Central Intelligence Agency as a spy for the Czechoslovak intelligence service and turning over classified C.I.A. information to the Czechoslovaks.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mrs. Koecher, who was arrested with her husband on Tuesday, just hours before they were to fly to Europe, is being held as a material witness. According to an affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, she was an espionage courier for her husband.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Koecher's lawyer, Joseph Calluori, said his client planned to plead not guilty to the charges, which could carry a life sentence.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    According to the F.B.I., Mr. Koecher was sent to the United States in 1965 by the Czechoslovak intelligence service after two years of espionage training.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But friends and co-workers of the Koechers, some of whom have known them since they arrived in the country, said in interviews that neither had caused the slightest suspicion of being on a spy mission.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''It's hard to believe,'' said Irving Peck, a friend. ''He always talked about how he hated Communists and what they doing to his country.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Koecher, 50 years old, was described as an intellectual who, above all, wanted to succeed in the United States but had difficulty finding steady work after he lost his job seven years ago with the C.I.A.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Koechers told friends that in 1965 they escaped from Czechoslavkia, where Mr. Koecher had received university degrees in mathematics and philosophy.  But they gave few details of how they got out of the country.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Michael Reinitz, an executive for a printing company, said he met the couple in 1965 while on vacation in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''They said they wanted to escape Communism,'' Mr. Reinitz recalled.  ''Hana said her father was a Communist Party member, and I got the impression that she was rebelling.  I never heard Karl say anything good about Russia.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Both eventually became American citizens.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Koecher's first known job in the United States was at Wagner College on Staten Island, where he was appointed an instructor in the philosophy department in 1969. On his resume he said he had been a consultant for Radio Free Europe.  The next year, he was promoted to assistant professor.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Koecher resigned from the college in January 1973 and after obtaining security clearance, worked for the C.I.A. as a contract employee from February 1973 to August 1975, according to the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani. A contract employee is not a regular staff member of the agency.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Koecher was a translator for the C.I.A. in Washington for the first two years and from 1975 to 1977 worked in an unspecified job for the agency in New York.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Acquaintances in New York said Mr. Koecher had talked openly and proudly of being employed by the C.I.A.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr.Peck recalled that when he had visited the couple at the apartment at 50 East 89th Street, Mr. Koecher had shown him a bell on the living-room wall.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''He said it was a device to ring the C.I.A. if anyone was tampering with his papers,'' Mr. Peck said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''I got the general impression that he was against anything liberal,'' he added. ''He worked for the local Republican Party and said he was going to vote for Reagan.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    But according to Mr. Giuliani, in the years he worked for the C.I.A. Mr. Koecher turned over classified information, including the names of C.I.A. personnel, to Czechoslovak intelligence. Mr. Giuliani declined to describe the seriousness of the materials obtained by Mr. Koecher.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    And from 1973 to 1984, Mr. Giuliani added, Mrs. Koecher was a paid courier for the Czechoslovak intelligence service and attended espionage meetings in New York and Europe.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dismayed at Dismissal        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Koecher was dismayed at being let go by the C.I.A. in 1977, friends said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''He was disappointed that his ideas were not accepted and he was not made a permanent employee,'' Mr. Reinitz's wife, Joyce, said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    From September 1979 to August 1980, Mr. Koecher was a teacher of humanities at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury, L.I.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    While Mr. Koecher was seemingly having job difficulties, Mrs. Koecher, who is now 40, worked in Manhattan's diamond district. Joseph Savion, a diamond dealer, said he hired her as a saleswoman more than 10 years ago. Five years ago, he and Mrs. Koecher formed a diamond and jewelry company, the Novissa Corporation, in a tiny, cluttered office at 30 West 47th Street.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Everyone on the street loved her,'' said Mr. Savlon. ''When she said goodbye on Tuesday, I saw tears in her eyes.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Koechers, according to friends, bought the East 89th Street two-bedroom cooperative apartment nine years ago for $40,000, with an initial payment of $4,000. Friends said they lived modestly, almost frugally.  Their car was a blue 1974 BMW.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Last Friday, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Koecher gave a signed statement about his espionage activities. But the arrests were delayed, Mr. Giuliani said, ''to gather additional information and for security reasons.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    On Monday, Mr. Giuliani said, the Koechers closed a deal to sell their apartment for about $280,000. They were scheduled to fly to Zurich from Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday at 8 P.M. At about 4 P.M. they took a cab to the Barbizon Plaza Hotel at 59th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, where they were arrested on the sidewalk at 4:15 P.M.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Yesterday, at Mr. Calluori's request, a hearing on pleas and possible bail was postponed until today.  Barry Bohrer, an assistant United States attorney who is in charge of the case, said he would request that the Koechers be held without bail because of the risk they might flee the country.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Although as a material witness Mrs. Koecher has not been formally accused of any crime, she as well as her husband can be held without bail.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Koechers' friends said the couple had talked about moving to Austria, where Mr. Koecher said he planned to work in a construction company.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''We saw them about 10 days ago at a farewell dinner in our home,'' Mr. Peck said. ''There was no indication they were apprehensive.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Spies, absolutely not,'' said Mrs. Reinitz. ''That doesn't make sense. Even when they said they were going to Austria, it was because of economic problems. They sounded like their allegiance was very much to America.''        </p>

Yesterday, in a courtroom at the United States Court House on Foley Square, Mr. Koecher was formally charged with infiltrating the Central Intelligence Agency as a spy for the Czechoslovak intelligence service and turning over classified C.I.A. information to the Czechoslovaks.   Mrs. Koecher, who was arrested with her husband on Tuesday, just hours before they were to fly to Europe, is being held as a material witness. According to an affidavit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, she was an espionage courier for her husband."></div>
