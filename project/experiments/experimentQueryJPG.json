There's something odd about the subway car that Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospitals used to give a distinct New York flavor to this ad celebrating their partnership. The ad, which has been up for a month, was produced by an advertising agency whose staff looked through hundreds of stock photographs to find a representative example of a New York subway train. But Joseph P. Brennan, a rail buff who is a computer specialist at Columbia University, took a closer look after people began asking where that subway car was really from. His verdict: ''That's definitely not New York. It looks like the Chicago el.'' Sure enough, he found a Web site (http://members.aol.com/chictafan/p3200.jpg) where you can see a twin of this car. The billboard was scheduled to be up for six months, but now that word of Mr. Brennan's discovery is out, the ad will be replaced in a couple of weeks. ''It's a chance for us to include our new partnership with Long Island College Hospital,'' said Kathleen McGovern, vice president for public affairs and marketing at Beth Israel and St. Luke's Roosevelt. And the subway car pictured, she said, will be changed to one that is ''clearly a New York City train.''

The problem: How do you market the tallest skyscraper at the World Trade Center site to prospective tenants? When readers were reminded last week that the authority had -- largely for leasing reasons -- quietly been replacing the symbolic name \"Freedom Tower\" with the more prosaic (but also symbolic) \"1 World Trade Center,\" hundreds of comments followed. Many included alternative name suggestions; about which, more in a moment.This week, we'd like more than comments. Following the terrific response to our 2007 exercise in taxi logo redesign, we hope the designers among you -- amateur and pro -- will consider drawing up a hypothetical logo proposal for the new building. Image files in JPG or GIF formats are preferable, sent as e-mail attachments to cityroom@nytimes.com by 5 p.m. Friday. You're free to use whatever building name suits you, but please relate the appearance of the logo to the words. (We've prepared a few examples, to the left and below, of what we're talking about.) The best logos will be displayed on City Room next week. There is no reward other than the satisfaction of seeing your work on the site. To learn more about the building, visit the Port Authority's Web site.","abstract":"A City Room design contest: Won't you help burnish the image of 1 World Trade Center?
