Basic set up
- Start up a basic site, run with node 
- Make sure it includes the Jquery and Masonry 
- Create an Ajax call to a test data-set
- Append the images to the document with the url-s provided by the dataset 
- This is the basic set up. 

Connecting the basic set up to the NYtimes Data
- Load the correct data set, which is already in Json 
- Change the code to append the images for this dataset per country
- Do this for multiple countries, creating two columns on the website. The aim is to visualize the representations of Oriental countries within the NYtimes database.
	- First we create two static colums, with the US on the left, and Iran on the right. Iran is a long time enemy of the US as well as a typical 		'Other' or 'Oriental' county according to out theoretical framework. 
- Watch the show!
