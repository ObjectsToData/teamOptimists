What: Image J sample testing 

ImageJ sample testing, what type of patterns can we get using ImageJ?  

The sample files from ImageJ consist of 700 pictures. We plotted the pictures, paintings of van Gogh, on an x-as with Year and an y-as with brightness. 

(See the output in van gogh brightness 1 oktober.jpg)

We noticed that the pictures are nicely plotted, but the whole of picture is not very informative. It is unclear what the plot consists of. 
Since we focus especially on large image-files, this tool of ImageJ is not suitable for our type of research. Also, ImageJ does not allow us to 'stumble upon'  a pattern, because it needs a X or Y. 

Concluding, we discussed different tools that would be able to represent the whole file. 

Javascript could be suitable for this.
