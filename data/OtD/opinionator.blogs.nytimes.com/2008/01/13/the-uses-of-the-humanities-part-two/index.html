						<div class="entry-content"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a poem titled “Matins,&#8221; the 17th century Anglican poet George Herbert says to God, <em>If you will “teach me thy love to know . . . Then by a sunbeam I will climb to thee.”</em> But the dynamics of the proffered bargain – if you do X, I’ll do Y – are undercut by the line that proposes it, and especially by the double pun in “sunbeam.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Sun” is a standard pun on Son; it refers to Jesus Christ; “beam” means not only ray of light, but a piece of wood large enough to support a structure; it refers to the cross on which a crucified Christ by dying takes upon himself and redeems (pays the price for) the sins of those who believe in him.  So while “by a sunbeam” seems to specify the means by which the poem’s speaker will perform a certain act – “I will climb to thee” – the phrase undercut his claim to be able to do so by reminding us (not him) that Christ has already done the climbing and thereby  prevented (in the sense of anticipating) any positive act man mistakenly thinks to be his own. If the speaker climbs to God, he does so by means of God, and cannot take any personal credit for what he “does.” If he truly knows God&#8217;s love, he will know that as an unconditional and all-sufficing gift it has disabled him as an agent.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This brief analysis of a line of poetry that simultaneously reports a resolution and undermines it is an example of the kind of work and teaching I have done for almost five decades. It is the work of a humanist, that is, someone employed in a college to teach literary, philosophical and historical texts. The questions raised in <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/" target="new">my previous column</a> and in the responses to it are: what is the value of such work, why should anyone fund it, and why (for what reasons) does anyone do it?<br />
<span id="more-2515"></span><br />
Why do I do it? I don’t do it because Herbert and I are co-religionists. I don’t believe what he believes or value what he values. I don’t do it because it inspires me to do other things, like change my religion, or go out and work for the poor. If I had to say, I’d say that I do it because I get something like an athletic satisfaction from the experience of trying to figure out how a remarkable verbal feat has been achieved. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The satisfaction is partly self-satisfaction – it is like solving a puzzle – but the greater satisfaction is the opportunity to marvel at what a few people are able to do with the language we all use. “Isn’t that amazing?,” I often say to my students.  “Don’t you wish you could write a line like that?” (In the column I used the word “pleasure” to describe the reward of discussing and unpacking literary texts, but “pleasure” is at once too narrow and too broad; it is the very particular pleasure that attends cognitive awareness of an effect you not only experience but can now explain.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Note that what we’re talking about here is the study, not the production, of humanistic texts. The question I posed in the column was not do works of literature, philosophy and history have instrumental value, but does the academic analysis of works of literature, philosophy and history have instrumental value. When <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14130" target="new">Jeffrey Sachs says</a> that “in the real world” the distinction between the humanities and the sciences on the basis of utility does not hold because “philosophers have made important contributions to the sciences” and “the hard sciences have had a profound impact on the humanities,” he doesn’t come within 100 miles of refuting anything I say.  Whatever does or does not happen in the “real world” is not the issue; the issue is what happens in the academic world, where the distinctions Sachs dismisses do hold. It may be, as <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14284" target="new">George Mobus maintains</a>, that “only in academia where you are supposed to be a specialist . . . do we parse the world into silos,” but the academic world is by definition parsed into silos and when the utility of one of them is questioned, it is not to any point to say that in some other world everything exists in some great big mix.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In general those who disagree with my assertions do what Sachs and Mobus do &#8212; slide (without acknowledgment or awareness) back and forth between the precincts of academia (which, to make the point again, are the precincts where the dispute is located) to the precincts, often larger, of some other enterprise. When I  declare that the humanities are of no use whatsoever, I am talking about humanities departments (“the humanities” is an academic, not a cultural category), not about poets and philosophers and the effects they do or do not have in the world and on those who read them. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The funding of the humanities in colleges and universities cannot be justified by pointing to the fact that poems and philosophical arguments have changed lives and started movements. (I was surprised that no one mentioned &#8220;Uncle Tom’s Cabin,&#8221; a book Lincoln is said to have credited with the starting of the Civil War.) The pertinent question is, <em>Do humanities courses change lives and start movements?  Does one teach with that purpose, and if one did could it be realized?</em> </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If the answers to these questions are (as I contend) “no” – one teaches the subject matter and any delayed effect of what happens in a classroom is contingent and cannot be aimed at – then the route of external justification of the humanities, of a justification that depends on the calculation of measurable results, is closed down.  The fact that some commentators, including a few of my former students, report life-changing experiences as a result of their studies is heartening (although I am sure that the vast majority would report something quite different), but it hardly amounts to a reason for supporting  the entire apparatus of departments, degrees, colloquia etc. that has grown up around the academic study of humanistic texts.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some who posted put forward a negative reason for supporting the teaching the humanities.  They say things like, <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14401" target="new">if only “the cabal running or government . . . had known a bit of history, we might not be in Iraq”</a> and <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14511" target="new">“Would the neoconservatives really believe that the world is a battlefield of good versus evil</a> were they to expand their minds to include a more complete knowledge of history and human nature?” But the neoconservatives these respondents no doubt have in mind – Wolfowitz, Pearle, Kristol, Huntington – are as widely read in history, philosophy and  the arts as anyone, and they participate in deeply intellectual discussions of important texts in the Liberty Fund seminars and elsewhere. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Assuming that if they had been schooled in the right texts (Paul Krugman rather than Milton Friedman, Cornel West rather than William Buckley) they would have devised better policies is a fantasy, and indeed, it is the same fantasy the neoconservatives buy into when they argue that if we were to introduce radical Muslims to the writings of Jefferson, Madison and J.S. Mill, they would learn to love freedom and stop wanting to destroy us. The truth is that a mastery of literary and philosophical texts and the acquisition of wisdom (in whatever form) are independent variables.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All of this should not be taken to mean, as it was by some, that I am attacking the humanities or denigrating them or declaring them worthless. I am saying that the value of the humanities cannot be validated by some measure external to the obsessions that lead some (like me) to devote their working lives to them – measures like increased economic productivity, or the fashioning of an informed citizenry, or the sharpening of moral perceptions, or the lessening of prejudice and discrimination. If these or some other instrumental benchmarks – instrumental in the sense that they are tied to a secondary effect rather than to an internal economy – are what the humanities must meet, they will always fall short.  But the refusal of the humanities to acknowledge or bow to an end they do not contemplate is, I argue, their salvation and their value. As <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14525" target="new">Stacia says</a> in words more precise than mine, “The subject of these studies are not to be used as tools to achieve something else . . . they are the achievement.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of course, this does not mean that anyone will pay for them.  In fact, as several posters observed, my argument (and it isn’t only mine) that the humanities are their own good and aren’t much good for anything else can be used to justify turning humanities departments into service departments and cutting funding for humanities research.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I still remember serving on an all-university committee at Johns Hopkins University and hearing one of my fellow committee members say that he would happily support the English department because his wife very much enjoyed seeing plays. When I told him that the department never put on plays, and at that moment did not even have a faculty member who was interested in plays, he was amazed and asked the obvious question: What then do you do? When I replied that we research things like medieval astrology, Renaisssance iconography, 18th century political satire and romantic theories of the imagination, and then share our findings and interpretations with students, his puzzlement grew. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Had he asked the next question – but what can you do with that? – I would have had to say, not much of anything except, perhaps, entice a few people to join the same esoteric enterprise. He was more polite than another colleague, a friend, who announced one day that members of English departments were “parasites on the carcass of literature.” A medical doctor, he was also a lover of literature and just didn’t see why a world that already had poets and novelists and playwrights needed an army of people feeding off them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">His sentiments were echoed by those respondents who complained that humanities departments are narrowly professional and concerned largely with reproducing themselves. <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14301" target="new">“A father” reports</a> the “repugnant truth” that “the humanities is study of a discipline. Mastery of the discipline qualifies you to profess it.” <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14821" target="new">Qjiang observes</a> that “there are Shakespeares and Shakespeare’s interpreters&#8221; and “Humanities nowadays&#8230; largely and unfortunately refer to the latter.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That’s right. What is in need of defense is not the existence of Shakespeare, but the existence of the Shakespeare industry (and of the Herbert industry and of the Hemingway industry), with its seminars, journals, symposia, dissertations, libraries. The challenge of utility is not put (except by avowed Philistines ) to literary artists, but to the scholarly machinery that seems to take those operating it further and further away from the primary texts into the reaches of incomprehensible and often corrosive theory. More than one poster decried the impenetrable jargon of literary studies. Why, one wonders, is the same complaint not made against physics or economics or biology or psychology, all disciplines with vocabularies entirely closed to the uninitiated? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The answer is that those disciplines are understood to be up to something and to be promising a payoff that will someday benefit even those who couldn’t read a page of their journals. What benefit do literary studies hold out to those asked to support them?  Not much of anything except the (parochial) excitement experienced by those caught up in arcane discussions of the mirror stage, the trace, the subaltern and the performative. (Don’t ask.)  The general public, which includes legislators, trustees, and parents, is on the side of my colleague at Johns Hopkins. Let them put on plays.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of the justifications for humanistic study offered in the comments, two seemed to me to have some force. The first is that taking courses in literature, philosophy and history provides training in critical thinking. I confess that I have always thought that “critical thinking” is an empty phrase, a slogan that a humanist has recourse to when someone asks what good is what you do and he or she has nothing to say.  What’s the distinction, I have more than occasionally asked, between critical thinking and just thinking? Isn’t the adjective superfluous?  And what exactly would “uncritical thinking” be? But now that I have read the often impassioned responses to my column, I have a better understanding of what critical thinking is. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Taking as an example the concept of IQ, <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14807" target="new">William Haboush says</a> that while a scientist will use it, a humanist “will ask what does it mean? Is it one thing or many? Who made up the questions used in measuring it.” This, then, is critical thinking – the analytic probing of formulas, precepts and pieces of received wisdom that too often go unexamined and unchallenged. This skill, <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14192" target="new">Warren Call claims</a>, is taught in humanities courses where students “analyze ideas, differing viewpoints, justifications, opinions and accounts” and, in the process, learn how to “construct a logical assessment . . . and defend their conclusions with facts and lucid argument.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That certainly sounds like a skill worth having, and I agree that it can be acquired in courses where literary texts, philosophical arguments and historical evens are being scrutinized with an eye to seeing what lies beneath (or to the side of) their surfaces. But it also can be, and is, acquired elsewhere. Right now millions of TV viewers are acquiring it when they watch Chris Matthews or George Will or Cokie Roberts analyze the current political moment and say things like, “It would be wrong to draw any long run conclusion from Hilary Clinton’s victory in New Hampshire because in other states the voting population is unlikely to be 57 percent female and 97 percent white,” or “If we are to understand the immigration debate, we must go back the great waves of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,” or “Homelessness is not a single problem, but a nest of problems that cannot be solved piecemeal.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">You can hear the same kind of thinking on sports radio, where host and callers-in debate the ingredients that go to make up a successful team. And critical thinking is what tens of thousands of preachers encourage every week in their sermons when they ask parishioners to slow down and reflect on the impulses, perhaps obscure to them, driving their everyday behavior. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So two cheers for critical thinking, but the fact that you can learn how to do it in any number of contexts means that it cannot be claimed for the humanities as a special benefit only they can supply. Justification requires more than evidence that a consumer can get a desirable commodity in your shop, too; it requires a demonstration that you have the exclusive franchise.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The second justification for studying the humanities that in my view has some force speaks to those of us who have been trapped in conversations with people who, after “How about those Bears?” (the equivalent of “hello” in Chicago), can think of nothing to say.  <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14633" target="new">EM observes</a> that “being exposed to great ideas from variety of fields . . . and learning how to think critically all make for a more interesting and informed person” and that “lots of people want interesting and informed people as their friends, lovers and employees.” Amen.  Count me as one of those who would welcome an increase in the number of those who can be relied on to enliven a dinner party rather than kill it (although I have seen dinner parties killed by the most erudite and sophisticated person at the table). But it won’t do as a defense society will take seriously to say, <em>Let’s support the humanities so that Stanley Fish and his friends have more people to talk to</em>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One final point. <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/will-the-humanities-save-us/#comment-14435" target="new">Nguyen Chau Giao asks</a>, “Dr. Fish, when was the last time you read a poem . . . that so moved you to take certain actions to improve your lot or others?”  To tell the truth, I can’t remember a single time. But I can remember countless times when I’ve read a poem (like Herbert’s “Matins”) and said “Wow!” or “Isn’t that just great?” That’s more than enough in my view to justify the enterprise of humanistic study, but I cannot believe, as much as I would like to, that the world can be persuaded to subsidize my moments of aesthetic wonderment.</p>

			<p>Professor Fish seems to equate &#8220;studying the humanities&#8221; with &#8220;teaching the humanities&#8221; and &#8220;researching the humanities.&#8221; They are not the same. It may certainly be a waste of educational funding to support the production of one more, increasingly obscure but tenure producing, treatise or journal article &#8211; but spending money to provide guidance and an incentive (i.e., grades) for college students to explore a variety of sources of literary and historic thought does seem worthwhile. Otherwise, would the journalist that the professor cites have ever found the way to the assertion that “If we are to understand the immigration debate, we must go back the great waves of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries”? Or did that come from a love of learning and an interest in history that began in a class taught by a humanities professor.</p>
<p>The critique that humanities departments lack value from a cost/benefit perspective says more about the way our particular educational institutions are structured than it does about the inherent worth of the subject matter.</p>

			<p>Three thoughts:  </p>
<p>(1) &#8220;the job of [literary analysis] is to send the reader back to the work with greater understanding and appreciation.&#8221;  So said one of my professors. Made sense to me, whether it pays well, or is worth paying for at all.</p>
<p>(2) I once heard that the actual definition of &#8220;liberal arts&#8221; is &#8220;learning to be free.&#8221;  We could sure use more of that. If the humanities helps us know better how to do that, how can it not be worth it in a democracy?</p>
<p>(3) Short comments are easier to read than long ones.  I hope this was short enough.</p>

			<p>Stanley Fish writes: &#8220;More than one poster decried the impenetrable jargon of literary studies. Why, one wonders, is the same complaint not made against physics or economics or biology or psychology, all disciplines with vocabularies entirely closed to the uninitiated?&#8221; </p>
<p>Oh, please. You come across as barely concealed sour grapes here. You seem to be clammoring to be included in with the &#8220;big guns&#8221; of truly &#8220;serious&#8221; disciplines like Physics. However, Physics has complicated jargon that is due to it being a hard science. The same cannot be said for the humanities. Nor should it to be claimed. It&#8217;s really a very poor excuse that attempts to justify ugly, needlessly obtuse language. Oh, it&#8217;s much too esoteric for the unwashed masses! If people like yourself want to keep things complicated, fine. In my opinion, it has more to do with ego than wisdom, however.</p>

			<p>Surely Dean Fish has this backwards.  It is the humanities that are self justifying.  Humanity departments serve the purpose of teaching their students, primarily, but also their readers how better to appreciate the humanities.  No small thing that and nicely demonstrated by Dean Fish&#8217;s opening paragraph.  (Anyone who would ask for or expect more is, as Wittgenstein might say, just acting strangely.)  There are many out there, obviously, who don&#8217;t mind chucking in a dime or two for this including some, like me, who learn to see, and then can&#8217;t help seeing, in the work of someone like, oh, say Milton, with the help of someone like, oh say, Fish, glimpses of a transcendence.  And no small thing that either.  So Stan, the check is in the mail and thanks for, however unwilling it might or might not be in your case, doing God&#8217;s work.</p>

			<p>Dr. Fish, I largely agree with your reasoning, although I am sad that it will comfort those who wish to defund the public sector. I hasten to add, however, that you speak from a position of great security. For those who are marginalized, becoming conversant in Western thought and US history, with formal written English, and methods of argumentation &#8212; at least to the level of their white colleagues &#8212; are absolute necessities. The need results primarily from their coming from denigrated peoples, but the need is there nonetheless. This is not to say that Shakespeare and Mozart will save the inner city (and I hate all movies and documentaries based on such rot). It is to say that marginalized people have to prove more than do their mainstream counterparts and so, while humanities training may be lessening in importance for the privileged who enter the professions, their class and race subordinates will be required to demonstrate familiarity to compensate for their coming from a culture presumed to be devoid of any intellectual content. </p>
<p>You cited exclusive franchise as criteria. As conversations about class, race, and gender become more obscured and off-limits in larger public conversation, academe remains one of the last places to discuss them. Further, as the notion of expertise erodes, academe is one of the last places that requires research to support one&#8217;s claims.</p>

			<p>Since Dr. Fish mentioned my comment explicitly, the part about parsing academia into silos, I suppose I should remind readers that the comment referred to a call to make those silos more permeable across subject areas. He says that &#8220;by definition&#8221; academia is parsed into silos. I claim it is not by definition but by practice and habit. And by a belief that individuals have to choose a discipline early because they cannot be expected to know a great deal about many different subjects. It is also reinforced, today, by the societal prejudice for profit/making money/jobs, etc.</p>
<p>Disciplines are necessary to allow talented and interested individuals to work to extend our understanding on that front. So some form of organization that acknowledges &#8216;silos&#8217; is probably necessary (as I pointed out before, this has as much to do with the tenure question as it does with the subject legitimacy issue). But it doesn&#8217;t mean that universities need be constructed of insular domains.</p>
<p>In my comment I advanced the notion that a grounding in systems science could help ameliorate the current schism between humanities and the other disciplines, esp. I think between social sciences and the so-called natural sciences. It can provide a common language as a basis for what E.O. Wilson proposed &#8211; consilience.</p>
<p>My point WRT Dr. Fish&#8217;s thesis here is that such a question of whether or not the humanities departments are a good investment might be made moot by understanding how the work of the humanities (including researchers) is truly integrated into that of the sciences, engineering, etc. in viewing the world through the lens of systems science.</p>
<p>I again invite readers to visit our white paper site at: <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gmobus/Admin/SystemsScience/explainingSystemsScience.html" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.washington.edu/gmobus/Admin/SystemsScience/explainingSystemsScience.html</a></p>
<p>PS. To Jon (#3). Debugging a program does require a certain level of critical thinking skill, but if you are putting 65 hours into it the real critical thought might be better placed in original design! As I tell my students, effort =/= results. Sorry, I just couldn&#8217;t help the professorial urge in my own supposed silo.</p>

			<p>The humanities department is actually detrimental to my life&#8230;for instance, the other day I was looking for Hemingway&#8217;s ‘The Sun Also Rises’ at my university library and I found that it took far too long to locate. It was hidden amongst 40-50 other titles not written by Hemingway but were critiques on his work. </p>
<p>As I stood there in disbelief that so many &#8220;professors&#8221; were making careers off of one writer –while I struggle daily with advanced molecular biology desperately trying to fight my way into medical school- I realized that I would never get those embarrassing 10 minutes back -embarrassing because I did this in front of an ignorant posse of tri delt&#8217;s laughing at what they thought was my confusion with the library sorting system. </p>
<p>Thank you Humanities!!</p>

			<p>Dr. Fish argues any reasonable valuation of the humanities today ought to be based primarily on a kind of analytical pleasure, or pleasure not limited to an &#8220;obsession&#8221;, but in the doubling of pleasure over the reader&#8217;s understanding of  pleasure, or as he puts it: pleasure in &#8220;an effect you not only experience but can now explain.&#8221;  And it is this pleasurable excess that Dr. Fish “cannot believe, as much as I would like to, that the world can be persuaded to subsidize,&#8221; preferring instead a more naive &#8220;aesthetic wonderment&#8221;.  But isn’t this precisely where private and public subsidization takes place today, compensating any neutralizing inscription of guilty private pleasure within the register of proclaimed understanding?  Recall, for example, the crisis within US agriculture in the early 1980’s.  The Farm Aid concert in 1985, organized to address public awareness, portrayed the struggle of the US family farm in heart-wrenching imagery and testimony, frequently noting its importance to American tradition and character, and yet it was far more successful at consolidating the media’s portrayal of family farming as an “obsessive” pursuit, a guilty pleasure, and a refusal to come to grips with reality (“flight from reality”), already crystallized in 1984 with The River (Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek).  With Farm Aid, however, farmer’s themselves began to explain their labor in terms of obsessive pleasure, in a kind of spectacular public confession, and by 1987 real subsidization could be secured with the passage of the Agricultural Credit Act only by accepting the full implications of family farming as a guilty pleasure revealed in Reagan’s remark on signing this legislation, “Buster, they&#8217;re in a business that makes a Las Vegas crap table look like a guaranteed annual income.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Why should the world subsidize your moments of aesthetic wonderment?  So you can share them with the world.  I would never have noticed the pun in that line from &#8220;Matins,&#8221; but your analysis of it gave me some pleasure.  For the same reason, I often read reviews of movies I have already seen, so I can see what a better trained eye saw that I missed.</p>

			<p>Jonathan (16) said of the humanities professor that &#8216;She and many others in the university have the great privilege of pursuing their “hobbies.”&#8217;  That rang offensive to me.  In terms of privilege, isn&#8217;t she just like someone who loves, say, designing sophisticated car engines, and does that for a living?  Perhaps the implication is that people doing productive work are making greater sacrifices and doing work they don&#8217;t enjoy as much&#8212;taking the hit for the rest of us, so a lucky few can be the humanities professors they would rather have been.</p>

			<p>In 1978 I was an undergraduate studying philosophy at Yale University.  One evening I went to chat with one of my professors, Louis Dupre &#8212; at that time the T. L. Riggs Professor of Philosophy of Religion.  I said to him &#8220;Professor Dupre, I&#8217;ve been studying philosophy for several years now hoping to learn how to live, but I haven&#8217;t learned anything at all about how to live.&#8221; He said to me, &#8220;of course you haven&#8217;t.  Philosophy is academic.  I teach it because it&#8217;s my job.&#8221; We walked together from his office and he said to me, &#8220;This is where I really live,&#8221; and he crossed the street and went into a church.  The next year I left Yale and went to a yeshiva.</p>

			<p>Dr Fish has earned the right after almost fifty years of teaching to postulate and posit whatever he  wishes.                                            I am stuck on two posts in particular, one quite early on in this enless blog of opinions, in which a Computer Science student expresses his feelings about the Humanites as almost an amusement to his more serious science major.  That student actually takes pride in using the Humanity classes as a rest period from the rigors of his chosen field. What he fails to realize is that the classics are timeless whereas his field is as emphermal as fog.  There might not be such a thing as a computer as a computer is now known in less than a decade, and in less than fifty years the science will have so evolved that the texts and methods labored over now will have become as irrelevant as swordsmanship in today&#8217;s military.  </p>
<p>The other is the post that expresses that one school in India did away with their Humanities and replaced them with computer programming.<br />
Again, someday soon, computer programming will be comparable to barrel and hoop making, interesting sidelines in history and still useful but ones that are almost irrelevant occupations in an advanced society.  The poster theorizes that Shakespeare learned his craft from life, but fails to realize that this does not translate to all of humanity to do likewise. Only one Shakespeare has comes along in recorded history, so you had best study him and rely on what you learn to boost your life experience. The blameless color-blind know not what they miss but we who have that sight can empathize with their loss, and so with those who become totally ignorant of the Humanities in favor of the money-making possibilites in yet another passing technology. The color and texture of their lives are lost because they have lost one facet of the society into which they have thrust themselves. Only those in primitive societies without books or technology have the peace of which only others can dream.</p>

			<p>Portland, Oregon 16 January 2008</p>
<p>That such a massive spectrum of perceptions and opinions has been generated by Dr. Fish (434 as I write tonight)and NYT&#8217;s sponsorship of his essays encourages me. Why? Because,like many, I step away from media coverage of state primaries, shrinking glaciers,etc. wishing that more of us would reach for a good novel, a Bach fugue, a Wallace Stevens poem and feed upon what has transcended political hoopla, corporate indifference toward global environmental equilibrium, etc.  For 40+ years, having devoured the writings of France&#8217;s Paul Valery, I recommend this paraphrase of one of his astute ways of inviting us to the humanities: The difference between prose and poetry is the difference between walking to the door when hearing a knock and dancing toward that door, never reaching it! Both movements activate the same feet. Our minds and hearts thrive better with an interval of dancing to counter the daily march toward answering the &#8220;knock&#8221; of power, wages and all that is embodied in so-called &#8220;affluenza.&#8221;  Valery did not sermonize; he just danced elegantly&#8211;and sang as the French do so well.<br />

			<p>As a historian specialising in Modern British &amp; European History and one who has had the incredible good fortune of doing so in universities around the world for twenty-eight years, I could not suppress a broad grin when reading Dr. Stanley Fish&#8217;s blog. Even if I don&#8217;t agree with him, I loved what he had to say and the way he went about saying it! Dr. Fish, like me, clearly doesn&#8217;t live for just the weekends. What a bonus that is!</p>

			<p>&#8220;What is in need of defense is not the existence of Shakespeare, but the existence of the Shakespeare industry&#8221; succinctly makes the writer&#8217;s point.  I would offer that the &#8220;Shakespeare industry&#8221; is needed (to some degree) so that we can better understand Shakespeare.  And why do we wish to better understand him?  As Dr. Fish said, “Wow!”.  Many of us are simply excited by the humanities just as many of us are excited by sports (so we asked what justifies spectator sports?) as many of us are excited by many subjects that don&#8217;t have justification (such as &#8220;the news&#8221;: is my life really altered or improved when I learn from CNN about some killing 1000 miles from my home?).</p>

			<p>I suppose that if we&#8217;re looking at the humanities as some sort of cottage industry to turn out critics who, like Fish, make/made a living by saying &#8220;Wow! Look at how this poem works!&#8221; then there is no justification for funding the humanities departments at our universities. There is no (or little) intrinsic value in such &#8220;unpacking&#8221; of literary artifacts that would benefit the wider society. </p>
<p>But if we&#8217;re to look at the humanities as a place where educators can help students <i>come</i> to living by saying, &#8220;Wow! Look at what <i>I</i> do!&#8221; then we&#8217;re talking about a vital and unparalleled area of study: the study of the individual and her role as a creative member of a dynamic society. By studying the thoughts and creations of thinkers and artists past and present, we&#8217;re not trying to figure out what <i>they</i> do or did, but what <i>we</i><i> do, here and now. </p>
<p>Poems, novels, plays, paintings, philosophical tracts, cultures, (etc., etc.) are not some little bits of luggage that, once &#8220;unpacked&#8221;, are empty vessels. They are, like the Horn of Plenty, inexhaustible sources of nourishment, and it takes a well-trained, well-loving, and </i><i>creative</i> teacher to bring a student to an awareness of how these texts come to be meaningful (which is a much different proposal than explaining &#8220;what they mean&#8221;). </p>
<p>The humanities should be seen not simply as the precinct of &#8220;critical thinking,&#8221; but of &#8220;creative thinking&#8221; as well. Only by creatively thinking about texts, history, politics, our contemporary circumstance, and our individual lives can we consider ourselves human; the humanities is the first and greatest source for producing humans. In a humane society, there should be no further justification needed for why the humanities deserve equal funding.</p>

			<p>Many impassioned pleas and judiciously rationed arguments on behalf of the continuance of maintaining funding for humanities studies. Terrific.<br />
But after the noise dies down, and some of it was glorious, thank you, you gave me quite a headache, I think we&#8217;ll find at least for the immediate future that the status quo will prevail and Dr. Fish will return to his teaching like Cezanne to his apples.<br />
Maybe, then, our passion finds a new focus with even broader implications &#8211; an unrelenting vigilance against the slow and systemtatic, or sudden, errosion of the principles on which our constitutional democracy was founded, without which, the very institutions that foster critical and free thought are no longer needed.</p>

			<p>Stanley Fish&#8217;s article is an example of theory as practice. He has created a wow-wasn&#8217;t-that-effectively-crafted! piece of writing that has elicited lots of response. Any type-A personality might read it and say, &#8220;hey! I wish I could do that!&#8221; This is the kind of response that leads us to study literature &amp; art in the first place (according to Mr Fish). I guess this means that Mr. Fish wrote his article in the capacity of an artist rather than a critic.</p>
<p>So what is a critic? Well, decades ago they did just what Mr. Fish (he claims) has done throughout his career: point out the formal complexity of art. I teach literature at a university, and while I may point out neat puns here and there, this hardly characterizes my work as a whole. For me, the lines between literature, philosophy, theology, history, politics, and so forth are rather fluid. I study and teach literature in such a way that I am really studying and teaching the human story as I understand it. Unless we are mindless cogs in the economic machines of our time, or merely self-serving pleasure seekers annoyed with anything that doesn&#8217;t immediately gratify our pride or our senses, the human story will be intrinsically interesting and relevant.</p>
<p>Intrinsically interesting and relevant: now I am speaking like Mr. Fish. I apply these terms, however, to something much bigger and more appealing than a clever pun.</p>

			<p>Your examples of &#8220;learning critical thinking&#8221;, are not active &#8211; they are passive (as in TV, radio, the minister&#8217;s sermon, etc.). To learn critical thinking one must perform it actively until the skill becomes innate. A humanities department is ideal in this regard.</p>
<p>Moreover, critical thinking often requires more than simply the tools of analysis and deduction, but also an intimate understanding of many pieces of knowledge in order to compare, contrast, and explain the results of that analystic process. This knowledge in the sciences is composed of agreed upon laws, past experimentation, and even a history of the development of the scientific method itself. One proves one&#8217;s analysis not simply by showing the results of a process, but by contextualizing it in a world of knowledge hitherto learned and shared. </p>
<p>Similarly, this knowledge within the world of human interactions (i.e. interpersonal relationships, workplace ethics, politics, economics, cross-cultural interactions on every level from love to business) is composed of an aggregation of stories, philosophies, histories, ethnographies, fictions, religions, etc. that provide us with a context to understand human interactions and explain our beliefs, choices, and actions to each other. </p>
<p>To me, the instrumental value of the humanities is that it provides us with a better knowledge and context to critically think about the people around us, the ideas upon which people make choices, and the themes that permeate daily life. This knowledge and critical thinking has not a single instrumental output (i.e. making us good people), but gives us the opportunity to perform better at all functions in life since almost all functions include human interaction. We are typically better businessmen, better politicians, better scientists, better mechanics, when we can better understand and communicate with our customers, our coworkers, our partners, and our community in general.</p>
<p>The humanities can be the grease for the wheels in every aspect of daily life. Teaching them does not guarantee it &#8211; just like teaching history to the Neocons doesn&#8217;t guarantee better foreign policy, or teaching accounting to an entreprenuer doesn&#8217;t guarantee a better business. But if we choose to utilize the humanities by learning its process of critical thinking and its vast repetoire of knowledge about thousands of years of the human experience, we may indeed become better at everything we do.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s that for a justification for a little extra funding?</p>

			<p>There is a distinction between the justification for funding a humanities department and the justification for the study of humanities.  Dr. Fish seems to focus his argument on the latter while most of the writing is focused on the former.  </p>
<p>A humanities department trains students in the humanities (critical thought expressed through written and oral arguments).  This training is useful for society.  As a result, the training of students in the humanities is justified.  This, however, does not justify the academic study of the humanities.  To argue otherwise is to suggest that humanist are useful, but not the training of humanist.  </p>
<p>I am always surprised that an analogous argument is not made for mathematics.  A math department is funded to train students in math &#8211; that is its justification.  However, that training is largely unrelated to the academic study of math.  Consider Wiles&#8217; effort to solve Fermat&#8217;s last theorem. Solving that riddle did little to educate students and, therefore, was largely unrelated to the justification for a math department.  The effort and the achievement seem to be their own reward. Creating an environment in which faculty are free to study mathematics is simply what it costs a university to have great minds train students.  Likewise, training students is the cost to the professor who wishes an environment in which to study mathematics.  </p>
<p>Thus, there is no larger justification to the study of mathematics than to attract the best minds to teach math.  The justification for teaching math is clear as is the need for a department of mathematics to train students.  Similarly, although there is no justification for the study of humanities, the justification is clear for the department of humanities to train students.  Fifty books on Hemingway is merely the cost to attract great minds to teach Hemingway.</p>
