                    <p>Out of a mountain of files stored in Federal Government buildings for the last century, a thorny but seldom discussed period in American immigration history has slowly come to light in the last two years.</p><p>The period was 1882 to 1943, when the Chinese Exclusion Acts barred all but four categories of Chinese immigrants from entering the United States. The policy, which grew out of fear and protectionism, normally gets only the briefest mention in American history courses. Teachers, students, merchants and short-term visitors were welcome; laborers, in particular, were not.</p><p>But within the 12,000 files, now stored at the National Archives' Northeast Region division on Varick Street in lower Manhattan, there are thousands of details -- in telegrams, certificates, postcards, photographs and transcripts -- of the ordeals Chinese people faced and the cat-and-mouse game that evolved as they tried to enter the United States, mostly through New York. 'High-Stakes Game'</p><p>"It was a very high-stakes game, because it was very costly to come in from China," said Betty Lee Sung, a professor of history at City College and the author of several books about the Chinese experience in the United States.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Ms. Sung has led the project that brought new attention to the immigrant files decades after they were closed. Financed in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, researchers are transferring much of the information from the files to a computer database known as Chinese Immigration Records. When completed this year, the database will be the first to focus on this immigrant group and will be available to scholars for statistical analysis and other projects and to families seeking to document their own histories.</p><p>The files offer a glimpse into "paper families," created when a man legally in the United States agreed to sell his family documents and testimony so that an unrelated child could be sponsored for entry. To show that some applicants were merchants, ornate books were prepared, declaring the bearer to be a shareholder in a Chinatown company. So intense was the fear of being found out that many "paper sons" kept their false names all their lives; sometimes their survivors engraved their original names on their tombstones after they died. Interrogating Immigrants</p><p>In one file there is a sepia-tinted photograph of a 13-year-old boy, dressed in a peasant's blouse fastened at the shoulder. Behind the photo is the typed transcript of the interrogation he had to sit through, with questions from American immigration officials like "Did your mother have bound feet?" Two people identified as his father and sister sat through similar interviews; discrepancies in their answers could have meant a return to China for the boy. Every possible identifying mark is listed: a scar from a boil on his temple, more on his hands, a tiny mole near one ear.</p><p>In another file, a man is asked: "Who occupied the house on the fifth lot of your row in your native village?" A deposition gives his height and age and states that he "can be further identified by having no queue." Questions about water buffalo -- how many a village had, and their sex breakdown -- were common, and discrepancies received an inspector's crisp pencil checkmark beside the question.</p><p>"I'm not sure many people could survive this kind of interrogation," said Robert Morris, director of the National Archives for the Northeast Region.</p><p>Two retired sons of Chinatown, Kaimon Chin and Robert Lee, have been working as researchers on the project for the last year. They have come across people they knew in childhood and have come to regard the people who managed to make it into the country with a respectful awe.</p><p>"We sort of understood the whole thing, but we never realized what type of hardships and discrimination there was," Mr. Chin said.</p><p>Simply enduring the interrogations, which included testimony from witnesses (white witnesses were required for merchants) was a real test. "They were guilty until they proved otherwise," Mr. Lee said.  'Paper' Families</p><p>To make sure they proved otherwise, immigrants and their families -- "paper" and otherwise -- prepared crib sheets months ahead of their arrivals. "They would have to study," Mr. Chin said, "and know things like: My house is the third house in the fourth row, the ancestral hall is in the third row facing left, and there are this many water buffalo in the village: this many males, this many females."</p><p>Mr. Lee, a former banker whose father was a restaurant worker, discovered his uncle's records in the file; the uncle was interrogated on his way out of the country as he took Mr. Lee's grandfather's bones to China for burial. Mr. Chin had a cousin who came in as the "paper son" of a man whose surname was Tom. Until he served in the Navy during World War II, after which he was eligible for naturalization, Mr. Chin's cousin kept the name. Then he formally became a Chin again.</p><p>"It's really important for the general public to know and also to understand the full story of what happened to Chinese immigrants coming to America," said Sue Lee, a spokeswoman for the Chinatown History Museum, which is not involved in the project. "It's not something you can really find out about from your history books in school or in college." Calling 32 Mott Street Home</p><p>Mr. Lee and Mr. Chin were responsible for determining the names, places of origin and other fundamental details about each file for entry into the database.</p><p>But they are also getting a rare overview of the process and the people who went through it. They laugh when they see someone who gave 32 Mott Street as an address to the immigration officials. "There must be 5,000 people who were living in that building," Mr. Chin said. But such "coincidences" often went undetected by inspectors, who had no central information source that would reveal such patterns.</p><p>Because only Chinese applicants went through such extensive interrogation, the files provide rich historical detail about the places they said they came from. The files, when analyzed, are also expected to give detailed information about Chinese immigration patterns during that period.</p><p>"We just had a group of archivists here from mainland China," Mr. Morris said. "They were fascinated. They weren't aware that these existed." Similar projects have been proposed in Seattle and San Francisco, he said.</p><p>Ms. Sung, who said her own family entered the country through Seattle, got the project going in 1990 after she heard about the files, then stored in Bayonne, N.J. She began with a grant from the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation in Taiwan and finished the work with another grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>'It was a very sad chapter in Chinese-American history," she says, "because it shows the type of persecution that went on. Some people were kept in detention for a year or two, and grilled and grilled and grilled." Some became depressed and committed suicide. Most of them persisted, and became part of the nation's history.</p><p>Photo: Robert Lee, left, and Kaimon Chin at the National Archives' Northeast Region division on Varick Street in lower Manhattan, where they are helping to create a Chinese Immigration Records computer database from the 12,000 files stored there.
