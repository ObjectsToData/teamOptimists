    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  THE eight plays and four musical works that comprise Genesis 1994 at the Crossroads Theater Company are in no shape for scrutiny by critics nor are they ready for the niceties of production. But anyone who cares about the process of theatrical creation wouldn't mind taking up residence at Crossroads for 11 days starting Thursday.    The aptly titled festival of works in progress to be performed as a series of staged readings marks the theater's fifth foray into the untried. This year though, Genesis is concluding the season for the first time. &quot;That puts our whole concentration on the event, instead of splitting the theater's focus, as when it happens between shows,&quot; said Sydne Mahone, the director of Crossroads play development, who is in charge of Genesis. &quot;More than in past years, this festival is a fusion of tradition -- new spins on tradition -- and innovation,&quot; Ms. Mahone added.">

                    <p>THE eight plays and four musical works that comprise Genesis 1994 at the Crossroads Theater Company are in no shape for scrutiny by critics nor are they ready for the niceties of production. But anyone who cares about the process of theatrical creation wouldn't mind taking up residence at Crossroads for 11 days starting Thursday.</p><p>The aptly titled festival of works in progress to be performed as a series of staged readings marks the theater's fifth foray into the untried. This year though, Genesis is concluding the season for the first time. "That puts our whole concentration on the event, instead of splitting the theater's focus, as when it happens between shows," said Sydne Mahone, the director of Crossroads play development, who is in charge of Genesis. "More than in past years, this festival is a fusion of tradition -- new spins on tradition -- and innovation," Ms. Mahone added.</p><p>If one were to select a singular event on anticipatory grounds, it might well be "What Use Are Flowers" by Lorraine Hansberry -- certainly the festival's exemplar of tradition and its one posthumously produced work.</p><p>Ms. Hansberry, who died in 1965, six years after the Broadway premiere of her breakthrough play, "A Raisin in the Sun," conceived "Flowers" as a fable for television. After the death of Robert Nemiroff, Ms. Hansberry's husband, Harold Scott, the director, was entrusted by the Hansberry estate "to finish all the commas and periods, to complete thoughts, so her work would not sit in unfinished form," Mr. Scott said.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"After a piece Lorraine wrote about the Civil War for 'Omnibus' was considered too hot to produce, too dicey for 50's television," Mr. Scott said, "she became disenchanted with a new medium she thought would bring truth into the home -- so she put 'Flowers' aside."</p><p>Ms. Hanberry's fable concerns the survivors of a global holocaust, a colony of wild children who are discovered by an elderly hermit, a cave dweller for 20 years. "Lorraine feared the civilized world would blow itself up," Mr. Scott said. "When the hermit awakens, he finds the mutant children devoid of art, of beauty, of language -- of social conventions."</p><p>Ms. Mahone added: "And the hermit takes it upon himself to instill values, to do instruction, from the vocational to the humanities, to teach skills, from using utensils to understanding emotions."</p><p>In August, a fully mounted production of "Flowers," directed by Mr. Scott, is to play at the National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta. "It needs to be nurtured in several theaters -- to see what works and what doesn't" said Mr. Scott in his discussion of "filling in and flushing out" the unfinished or unproduced works of a playwright who, he said, "left cabinets full of writing; some may still be unfound."</p><p>And Crossroads is committed to producing "Flowers," as well as two more Genesis plays -- "My One Good Nerve" by Ruby Dee and "Fear Itself" by Eugene Lee -- next season or the season after that, said Ricardo Khan, the theater's artistic director.</p><p>At the other extreme of renown is the work of a fledgling playwright, Duane Chandler, a 21-year-old student of Africana studies at Rutgers University, in Genesis's new rites of passage series for playwrights 21 and under. Praising Ms. Hansberry as his inspiration, Mr. Chandler spoke of his first play, "Skingame," which is about two 19-year-old friends, Stiles, a black college student who comes home between semesters, and Clay, who goes to vocational school, never having left the neighborhood, "an unspecified one in New Jersey," Mr. Chandler said.</p><p>Clay's brother, a police officer, is witnessed in an act of brutality against a black youngster. As a consequence, issues of loyalty and integrity come up for the two teen-agers. Mr. Chandler, who is also an actor, said: "There are not a lot of parts for young performers that deal with those themes so I wanted to write them. The parts I've come across are stereotypical and shallow, and I'm looking for communication, sincerity and truth -- to bring an understanding of myself and of others to others."</p><p>Ms. Dee last season initiated a Crossroads project "Books With Legs" with "The Disappearance" by Rosa Guy. The project refers to the staging of literary works with attention to "the music of the words, the rhythm and the ideas -- in order to present a spoken portrait of the author," as Ms. Dee put it. Now she is performing in her own work "My Own Good Nerve" as a solo play. Published in 1987 and currently being reworked, it is a series of vignettes in tribute to momentous people in the actress-writer's life; among them, Lena Horne, Marvin Gaye, Diana Sands -- and "teachers I've had," Ms. Dee said.</p><p>"During Genesis, we'll see what we've got and what we should leave out, and what our next step might be," Ms. Dee said. "It's a luxury to have an opportunity to take that kind of look at the material and get feedback from the audience."</p><p>Ms. Mahone emphasized a festival first: four musical works. These are: *"A Dash of Diva," a musical memoir bySarah Dash, a member of the 50's type girl group, Blue Belles, later to become the radicalized La Belle, with Patti La Belle as the reigning diva.</p>                </div>
