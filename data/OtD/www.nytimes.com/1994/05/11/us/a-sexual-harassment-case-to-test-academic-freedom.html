The Talmud says he is innocent of sin, since the act was unintentional.</p><p>A woman in the class was offended, not by the sexual theme but because she believed the story justified brutality toward women. She filed a complaint against Professor Snyder, an ordained minister who has used the Talmudic lesson in the classroom for more than 30 years. Spreading the Word</p>                </div>

                    <p>The university issued a formal reprimand and put notices in the mailboxes of every student and teacher at the school, telling them that Dr. Snyder had "engaged in verbal conduct of a sexual nature" that had the effect of "creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive" environment.</p><p>The professor, contending that his reputation has been unjustly tarnished, has filed suit in Cook County court against the seminary for defamation of character. "It's humiliating," he said. "People hear about sexual harassment and they suppose I went around pinching students."</p><p>Some scholars say the specter of sexual harassment charges, which can ruin a career, is having a chilling effect on intellectual discourse in America's colleges and universities as professors and instructors avoid legitimate but touchy subjects.</p><p>Experts on sexual harassment say the overwhelming number of cases involve serious abuse.</p><p>"Men have this perception today that almost anything at all can be considered sexual harassment, and that's just not accurate," said Eric Satre, a lawyer in Minneapolis who represents people filing claims for harassment. "Sexual harassment is not just some 'mistake.' It's when you're out to demean and degrade."</p><p>Universities have seen a sharp increase in the number of sexual harassment charges that focus on the content of classroom lectures or reading material, said Ann Franke, a spokeswoman for the American Association of University Professors.</p><p>Legal experts say the Snyder case could force the Supreme Court to decide whether sexual harassment codes violate the First Amendment rights of free speech. Federal courts in Michigan and Wisconsin have struck down codes at colleges in those states that forbade "hate speech." 'New Victorian Era' Feared</p><p>"Sexual issues are becoming more difficult to discuss in the classroom," Ms. Franke said. "I hope we're not entering a new Victorian era where certain topics cannot be discussed."</p><p>"This is not to say that concerns about the problems of sexual harassment on campus are not legitimate," she continued. "But the serious, sober classroom discussion of sex does not, in and of itself, create a hostile environment."</p><p>Professor Snyder said the woman in his class told him that the story from the Talmud, and his selection of it, conveyed the message that it was permissible to harm women as long as it was unwitting. "She said, 'Men have abused me all my all my life, and then claimed that they just weren't aware of it.' " (The seminary has not identified the woman.)</p><p>The Chicago Theological Seminary trains ministers for the United Church of Christ, one of the most liberal denominations in the country. It has a Sexual Harassment Task Force, composed of students and faculty members, to investigate and judge such complaints. Other Complaints Recalled</p><p>Richard Lewis, a professor who is a member of the panel, said that he could not talk about the specifics of the case against Dr. Snyder but added that the charges involved "more than just this one case."</p><p>Dr. Snyder said the panel informed him of the other complaints, which were never formal charges and which occurred several years ago. In one, a woman had complained that the professor inappropriately bumped into her near a copy machine. And he said the panel told him that three other women had complained that he touched them or "undressed them with his eyes."</p><p>Since filing the suit, Professor Snyder said he had received dozens of calls and letters from teachers who have rallied to his support. "They tell me, 'If you lose this case, it's all over for academic freedom.' "</p><p>Long before sexual harassment became part of the lexicon, teachers were getting into trouble for frank discussions in the classroom. In the 1940's Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher and social reformer, was denied appointment to the City University of New York because of his discussion of "trial marriages." Leo Koch, a University of Illinois professor, was dismissed in 1960 for writing a letter to the student newspaper about premarital sex. And Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., denied reappointment to a lecturer in 1967 for talking about homosexuality.</p><p>Teachers typically say they have no objection to strict enforcement of direct, or quid pro quo, sexual harassment: making sexual favors a condition of employment or a good grade. But they are uncomfortable with the issue of "hostile environment," as stated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's guidelines. Uncertain Dividing Line</p><p>"The dividing line between what is sexual harassment and legitimate academic discourse is not well-established right now," Ms. Franke said.  "And the concern is that a kind of self-censorship takes place and gets in the way of legitimate subjects of academic inquiry."</p><p>In 1940, the American Association of University Professors drafted a statement that is still its guiding principle on the issue: "Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject, but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject."</p><p>While discussion of sex has no place in a mathematics class, Ms. Franke said, any serious study of the humanities would be inadequate without it. It would be nearly impossible to study "Madame Bovary," for example, or, for that matter, the Bible, without talking about sex.</p><p>Photo: In the library of the Chicago Theological Seminary, Prof. Graydon Snyder holds a volume of the Talmud. It was a Talmudic story that led one of his students to file a complaint of sexual harassment against him.
