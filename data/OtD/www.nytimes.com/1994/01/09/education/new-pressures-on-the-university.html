And the students -- overwhelmingly white, middle-class and young -- were well suited to apprentice themselves to the masters, who were generally white, middle-class and middle-aged.</p><p>Today, an after-dinner line like Mr. Kerr's would inspire only a rueful smile. The perception is widespread now that the American university, and perhaps higher education as a whole, has not just grown but that it is overgrown, indeed become so bloated and muddled that it has all but lost its way.</p><p>The question is no longer whether to retract, consolidate, restructure and adapt in order to bear down on the basic mission of higher education -- preparing students to take part in their civilization -- but is whether these reforms can be accomplished from within or must be imposed from without. The answer to the question will be determined in large part by the outcome of a struggle -- some call it a shootout -- now in progress around the country between administrations and faculties.

                    <p>The pressures for change begin with tight money. Last year Yale University, with its traditional revenue streams choked by the poor economy, ran a deficit of $15.5 million and still needs about $1 billion in additional money for vital repairs to its crumbling physical plant. Since 1991 the California State Legislature has cut the budget of the University of California at Berkeley by $70 million, or 18.8 percent. Over the last four years the City University of New York, known as CUNY, the nation's largest urban university, has been slashed $200 million, or 20 percent.</p><p>On top of these strictures comes the rise of the New Student who is much more often nonwhite, relatively old, frequently part time, possibly a parent and determinedly job-oriented. These students cost more to educate than their predecessors because they frequently require remedial work, special language courses and financial aid to help with soaring tuition bills.</p><p>Forty percent of the current entering students at CUNY are black or Hispanic and trace their ancestry to the Caribbean. Nationwide, 43 percent of today's students are over 25, and 300,000 of them are over 50. At Portland State University, a state-assisted urban school in Oregon, the average age is 28 and only 1 percent of the student body lives in dorms. In addition, enrollment is expected to swell enormously with no prospect of increased revenue in the years ahead. CUNY, for example, anticipates a rise in its student population from 208,000 at present to a quarter-million by the end of the century.</p><p>Finally, critics of today's institutions of higher learning charge that their tuitions have risen out of sight, that new technologies are not being utilized and that colleges and universities are often engaged in research that is of marginal importance and is being done at the expense of teaching.</p><p>College and university administrators are generally much more focused than are faculty members on these institutional problems and pressures, not only because that is their field of specialization but because, unlike tenured professors, they can lose their jobs if they don't fix what's broken.</p><p>Last fall George E. Rupp, the new president of Columbia University, spoke with alarm of his discovery that Columbia had 123 separate centers and laboratories. "There simply must be a great deal of overlap," he said, promising to consolidate certain functions of the Business School with the Economics Department, and of the School of Public Health with Arts and Sciences. Like many leaders of major research universities, President Rupp also believes that educational emphasis must be shifted away from postgraduate to undergraduate education -- a hot issue around the country.</p><p>The new president of Yale University, Richard C. Levin, takes another approach to consolidating. "You can't be good at everything," he said in an interview. "We don't have to deal with every subspecialty in every field. Instead, we can create centers of excellence." And Harvard's president, Neil Rudenstine, directly contradicting Clark Kerr's memorable remark, said recently: "We need more emphasis on the university and less on the multiversity."</p><p>While today's college and university leaders have a clear understanding of their problems and needs, they actually lack the power to effect much change. Unlike the chiefs of General Motors and I.B.M., they cannot pare down and consolidate by handing out pink slips. About 70 percent of most college and university faculties are protected by tenure. And it is this entrenched professoriate, and not the administrators, that holds the power.</p>                </div>
