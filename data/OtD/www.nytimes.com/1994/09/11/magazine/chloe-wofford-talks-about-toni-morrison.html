                    <p>THE WOMAN BREEZING INTO A Princeton, N.J., restaurant in a brilliant silk caftan and with salt-and-pepper dreadlocks is Toni Morrison, 63, the Robert F. Goheen Professor in the Council of the Humanities at Princeton University and the 1993 Nobel Prize winner for literature. Heads turn as she moves to a table. Princetonians in khaki stare.</p><p>Since her Grand View-on-Hudson, N.Y., home burned to the ground last Christmas, Morrison has been living in this very Anglo-Saxon American town. "Princeton's fine for me right now," she explains as we sit down to lunch. "I have wonderful students and good friends here. Besides, I'm in the middle of a new novel and I don't want to think about where I'm living."</p><p>The new novel is tentatively called "Paradise." In writing it, Morrison says she has been trying to imagine language to describe a place where "race exists but doesn't matter." Race has always mattered a lot in Morrison's fiction. In six previous novels, including "Beloved," "Song of Solomon" and "Jazz," she has focused on the particular joys and sorrows of black American women's lives. As both a writer and editor -- Morrison was at Random House for 18 years -- she has made it her mission to get African-American voices into American literature.</p><p>As a luncheon companion, she is great fun -- a woman of subversive jokes, gossip and surprising bits of self-revelation (the laureate unwinds to Court TV and soap operas). The stories Morrison likes to tell have this deadpan/astonished quality to them. Like fellow Nobel winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez, she can recount the most atrocious tale and give horror a charming veneer. One suspects that Morrison long ago figured out how to battle the cruelties of race with her wit.</p>                </div>

                    <p>She grew up Chloe Anthony Wofford, in the rust-belt town of Lorain, Ohio. Her father, George, was a ship welder; her mother, Ramah, a homemaker. At Howard University, where she did undergraduate work in English, Chloe Anthony became known as Toni. After earning a master's in English literature at Cornell, she married Harold Morrison, a Washington architecture student, in 1959. But the union -- from all reports -- was difficult. (As open as Morrison is about most subjects, she refuses to discuss her former husband.) When the marriage ended in 1964, Morrison moved to Syracuse and then to New York with her two sons, Harold Ford, 3, and Slade, 3 months old. She supported the family as a book editor.</p><p>Evenings, after putting her children to bed, she worked on a novel about a sad black adolescent who dreams of changing the color of her eyes. "The Bluest Eye" was published in 1970, inspiring a whole generation of African-American women to tell their own stories -- women like Alice Walker, Gloria Naylor and Toni Cade Bambara.</p><p>"I'm not pleased with all the events and accidents of my life," she says over coffee and a cigarette. "You know, life is pretty terrible and some of it has hurt me a lot. I'd say I'm proud of a third of my life, comfortable with another third and would like to redo, reconfigure, the last third."</p><p>Q: When you went to Stockholm in December to collect the Nobel Prize, did you feel a sense of triumph?</p><p>A: I felt a lot of "we" excitement. It was as if the whole category of "female writer" and "black writer" had been redeemed. I felt I represented a whole world of women who either were silenced or who had never received the imprimatur of the established literary world. I felt the way I used to feel at commencements where I'd get an honorary degree: that it was very important for young black people to see a black person do that, that there were probably young people in South-Central Los Angeles or Selma who weren't quite sure that they could do it.  But seeing me up there might encourage them to write one of those books I'm desperate to read. And that made me happy. It gave me license to strut.</p><p>Q: You've said that even after publishing three novels, you didn't dare call yourself "a writer." How was that possible?</p><p>A: I think, at bottom, I simply was not prepared to do the adult thing, which in those days would be associated with the male thing, which was to say, "I'm a writer." I said, "I am a mother who writes" or "I am an editor who writes." The word "writer" was hard for me to say because that's what you put on your income-tax form. I do now say, "I'm a writer." But it's the difference between identifying one's work and being the person who does the work. I've always been the latter. I've always thought best when I wrote. Writing is what centered me. In the act of writing, I felt most alive, most coherent, most stable and most vulnerable.</p><p>Interestingly, I've always felt deserving. Growing up in Lorain, my parents made all of us feel as though there were these rather extraordinary deserving people within us. I felt like an aristocrat -- or what I think an aristocrat is. I always knew we were very poor. But that was never degrading. I remember a very important lesson that my father gave me when I was 12 or 13. He said, "You know, today I welded a perfect seam and I signed my name to it." And I said, "But, Daddy, no one's going to see it!" And he said, "Yeah, but I know it's there." So when I was working in kitchens, I did good work.</p><p>Q: When did you do that kind of work?</p>                </div>
