EXHIBITIONS</p><p>September   "HOUSE RULES" Everything you always wanted to know about the impact of race, class and other social factors on residential design -- and more -- will be revealed in 10 collaborative projects by architects and writers. "H'ome-lette," a project by Henry Smith Miller, Laurie Hawkinson and Silvia Kolbowski, cooks up a new kind of dwelling from the leftover spaces in and around the single-family house. To Dec. 11, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio. (614-292-0330)  "GOOD OFFICES AND BEYOND: THE EVOLUTION OF THE WORK PLACE" A show for your virtual lunch hour: how information technology has transformed office design. With more people "telecommuting" from home, should employers start chipping in on the rent? Tues. to Feb. 19, Cooper-Hewitt Museum.   "ART FOR LEARNING" Art projects for new public school buildings in New York City. The question is, How do these new works measure up to the legendary murals of the W.P.A.? Sept. 23-Nov. 10, sponsored by the Municipal Art Society at the Urban Center.   "SUBURBS OF UTOPIA" A retrospective of work by the New York architect and critic Michael Sorkin, featuring theoretical urban projects. Mr. Sorkin is one of the sharpest critics of our diminished public realm. The show will offer an opportunity to see how well he has retained a critical edge in design. Sept. 24-Nov. 5, Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare St. (431-5795)  "INVISIBLE CITIES" Stanley Greenberg has been photographing New York's hidden infrastructure for the past two years. The result is a haunting film noir of the corroded, undermaintained machinery -- bridge supports, turbines, water valves -- that still does its best to make the city tick. Sept. 26-Oct. 29, Avery Hall, Columbia University. (854-3510)   "THE MACHINE NEXT DOOR" Loud discos aren't the only noisy neighbors. This show looks at the integration of residential and industrial architecture and its effect on urban life. Sept. 30-Dec. 9, sponsorec by the Municipal Art Society at the Urban Center. October   "FROM SOCIETY TO SOLITUDE: PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SPACE IN THE 17TH CENTURY" It is sometimes thought that modern architects were the first to redefine traditional relationships between public and private space, but this show will demonstrate that the "inside-outside" question arose long before the advent of the open floor plan and the glass-curtain wall. Oct. 12-Jan. 15, Canadian Center for Architecture, Montreal. (514-939-7000)  "KARL FRIEDRICH SCHINKEL, 1781-1841: THE DRAMA OF ARCHITECTURE" A hundred drawings, presented in an installation designed by the exuberant Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman, highlight the theme of theatricality in the work of the influential German classicist. The drama here is, which architect will steal the show? Oct. 29-Jan. 2, Art Institute of Chicago. (312-443-3600)  "ARCHITECTURE IN A WELL-ORDERED UNIVERSE: LORD BURLINGTON'S VILLA AT CHISWICK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON'S GROUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA" Finely manicured hands-across-the-sea in this tribute to two masterpieces of Palladian Revival architecture, which brings together shows first seen in London and Charlottesville, Va. Oct. 29-Jan. 8, Heinz Architectural Center at the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh. (412-622-3131) November   THRESHOLDS/O.M.A. AT MOMA: "REM KOOLHAAS AND THE PLACE OF PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE" Designs for a new office complex in Lille, France, will be featured in this much anticipated show of recent work by the Dutch architect. Mr. Koolhaas, born in 1944, is one of the most widely admired architects of his generation. This show could persuade people that the rumors of modern architecture's death are vastly exaggerated. Nov. 3-Jan. 15, Museum of Modern Art. (Traveling to Columbus, Ohio, and Montreal)  "WORLD WAR II AND THE AMERICAN DREAM: HOW WARTIME BUILDING CHANGED A NATION" A bomber nose cone and a jukebox modeled after its design are two of the exhibits in a show devoted to the impact of military production on architecture and design. Nov. 11-Dec. 31, 1995, Building Museum, Washington. (202-272-2448) December   "CONTEMPORARY BRITISH ARCHITECTURE: RECENT PROJECTS FROM THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS SUMMER EXHIBITION" Sleek high-tech designs should dispel fears that the Prince of Wales has killed off modern architecture in England. Featuring projects by Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, the show also includes neo-Classical designs in the preferred Windsor style. Dec. 10-Feb. 26, National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Ave. (369-4880)  "ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE: BRUNELLESCHI TO MICHELANGELO" Frank Lloyd Wright once caustically dismissed it as "the Pantheon on top of the Parthenon," but for millions of others St. Peter's Basilica remains the symbol of the Eternal City. Antonio da Sangallo's massive wooden model (nearly 15 feet tall) of St. Peter's is the centerpiece of a show that stunned visitors over the summer at the Palazzi Grassi in Venice. Also on view will be Michelangelo's model for the dome. Dec. 18-April 16, National Gallery of Art, Washington. (202-737-4215) BUILDINGS  September   TIMES SQUARE HOTEL COMPETITION The New York State Urban Development Corporation will choose a design for a new hotel on Eighth Avenue and 42d Street; Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, and Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates are three of the architects competing. With only a few new shows scheduled to open on Broadway this fall, the designs by these architecture stars should provide one of the liveliest spectacles in town. October   CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR THE ARTS, ESCONDIDO, CALIF. A concert hall, museum and conference center are among the features of a 12-acre complex designed by Charles Moore. Quietly classical pavilions, rising from a serene garden setting -- a sublimely simple legacy from the influential post-modern architect and teacher.  "THE CONCILIATOR" John Hejduk, dean of the architecture school at Cooper Union, has not completed a building in New York since his remodeling of Cooper Union in 1975. This full-scale realization of his design for a tower, from his 1982 suite of drawings, "Berlin Masque," will stand for six months at the intersection of Fifth Ave. and 23d St.  EAST ACADEMIC BUILDING, HOSTOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE, CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, THE BRONX An international Hispanic arts festival will inaugurate Gwathmey Siegel's multipurpose building, which features galleries, theaters and a gymnasium, arranged around a central atrium.  SWISSAIR NORTH AMERICAN HEADQUARTERS, MELVILLE, L.I. Headed for the Alps? Test your Ray-Bans on this white-on-white office complex -- Richard Meier's first American building in five years.  November   DISNEY FEATURE ANIMATION BUILDING, BURBANK, CALIF. With Disney in turmoil, isn't it time for those indestructable icons Mickey, Snow White, Tinkerbell and the Fairy Godmother to come to the entertainment giant's rescue? Robert A. M. Stern's cartoon collage of a building enshrines executive offices inside a peaked sorcerer's hat. January   SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART Though the trees were trimmed from the top of Mario Botta's classical-modern design, the building's Cyclopean rotunda still has its eye on the skyline. Across the street from the Yerba Buena arts complex, the new museum will reinforce the civilized status of the city's south-of-Market district.  SEPULVEDA RECREATION CENTER, LOS ANGELES Architects seeking to defuse tensions in poor neighborhoods face a conflict between the need for security and the ideal of access. Hank Koning and Julie Eizenberg's design for an inner-city gymnasium seeks a taut, athletic balance between these needs. February   THE NEUROSCIENCES INSTITUTE, LA JOLLA, CALIF. Like Jonas Salk, founder of the nearby institute that bears his name, the Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman hopes to bridge the gap between the sciences and the humanities in a complex designed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. It features a recital hall and gardens for contemplation along with research labs.  March   TOWN CENTER COMPLEX, SEASIDE, FLA. While Seaside is known as the godmother of "neo-traditional" town planning -- a resort community famed as a testing ground for old ideas for housing and urban design -- the town's commercial center is graced with a distinguished modern building, by Steven Holl. A second will open this spring, with the completion of a new complex of shops, offices and apartments, designed by the Boston architects Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti.</p><p>Photo: "Insight," circa 1830, from a Karl Friedrich Schinkel exhibition in Chicago, opening Oct. 29.
