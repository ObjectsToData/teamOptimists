But the more discerning can catch a glimpse of the city's soul by looking up -- at the walls. Murals have added character to Washington's landscape for years.   &quot;Murals rank highly as a form of public artwork in the city,&quot; said Alec Simpson, the assistant director of the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities, which finances murals and other art projects. &quot;Murals provide a public service and add to the community. You find that the people raise a hue and cry if you try to take them away.&quot;">

On one section of Connecticut Avenue, a Warholesque rendition of Marilyn Monroe gazes toward downtown from the south wall of the Salon Roi, a posh hair salon.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Roi Barnard, a former fashion model and the owner of the salon, said the blank, muddy gray wall used to stare bleakly at him as he drove to work. Something had to be done, and for Mr. Barnard, Marilyn Monroe was the logical choice.</p><p>"Marilyn was like my alter ego," Mr. Barnard said, seated in a salon chair and surrounded by portraits of Monroe, including one by Andy Warhol. "I never thought she was funny. When I would go to the movies, my friends would sit and laugh at Marilyn, and I would sit and cry."</p><p>For almost five years, Mr. Barnard talked about putting Monroe on the salon wall. Finally, in 1980, Charles Stinson, Mr. Barnard's business partner, commissioned a portrait artist, John Bailey, to paint Monroe's face on the wall for Mr. Barnard's 40th birthday.</p><p>The mural has become something of a Washington landmark, reproduced in paintings and on T-shirts, calendars and postcards. It is even a stop on the route of the Olde Towne Trolley, a rolling tour bus.</p><p>After nearly 14 years, Monroe is still captivating, but Mr. Barnard says she has begun to suffer from the ravages of time. Over the years, he has adjusted the floodlights from a bright white to a gentler soft pink glow. In a few more years, when she begins to peel, Mr. Barnard said it will be time for something new.</p><p>Less than a mile across Rock Creek Park from Salon Roi is Adams-Morgan, the city's funkiest neighborhood, with a Latin flair and a lively night life. A wall on Champlain Street there that is shared by City Bikes and Ben &amp; Jerry's portrays two cows eating ice cream while riding a bike tandem, with a calf in a baby seat.</p><p>Robin Stallings, the founder of City Bikes, had plans for a mural when he bought an abandoned gas station and transformed it into a thriving bike store. He also bought the building next door and rented it to Ben &amp; Jerry's, with a requirement that the ice-cream shop pay for a mural. Ben &amp; Jerry's commissioned an employee, Sara Lee Terrat, a young artist, to develop a design that had to incorporate elements from both businesses.</p><p>"I told her if there was a bicycle in there prominently, I would look more favorably on it," Mr. Stallings said. "Her first impulse was exactly the right one."</p><p>But in 1991, a District of Columbia inspector maintained that the mural was not art but a sign and therefore violated a city sign law. After months of hearings, publicity and petitions in support of the mural from local residents, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly waived the permit requirement and apologized to City Bikes and Ben &amp; Jerry's. So, the mural stays.</p><p>A couple of blocks east of City Bikes, G. Byron Peck, an artist who has done 40 murals in Washington, has just completed one inspired by a two-day wave of looting and rock-throwing in 1991 after a black police officer shot a Hispanic man.</p><p>Mr. Peck was approached by the owners of Heller's Bakery with the idea for a mural on its building. In time, the owners of the Ontario Theater Building offered a more visible spot, a high wall that can be seen by eastbound traffic on the heavily traveled blocks of Columbia Road, a commercial street in the center of Adams-Morgan.</p><p>"The Latin American community felt shoved in a corner and put upon, so I wanted to do something that would recognize that segment of the community," Mr. Peck said. He began to design a mural with an Aztec relief and two colorful macaws. Once he started, though, African-American and Korean residents clamored for representation.</p><p>Because the mural was paid for by taxpayers' money in the form of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Mr. Peck felt he had to comply to some degree. "It's such a melting pot here that everyone wants a little piece of the action," he said. "I was comfortable with that because it really did make sense."</p><p>After months of discussion and compromise, the finished mural incorporates several elements: a realistic black and white rendering of a Polaroid photograph of a group of children from the neighborhood and, around the photograph, paintings of relics from the children's diverse cultures -- the Aztec relief, the macaws, a 16th-century Nigerian bronze sculpture and an Oriental dragon.</p><p>Although he also shows his paintings in galleries, Mr. Peck prefers murals.</p><p>"With a gallery opening, you're there and you have this flashpoint for one night for a one-month duration," he said. "But this gives you almost daily exposure to a lot of people who don't have the chance or the desire to go to a gallery."</p><p>Photos: Two macaws are in a multicultural mural in Washington.; Cows eat ice cream and ride a tandem bike in this mural.
