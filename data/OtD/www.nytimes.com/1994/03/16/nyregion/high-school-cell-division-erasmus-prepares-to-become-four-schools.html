                    <p>The Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, has decided that for the good of the school and its community, it is time to break with the past. He is moving to reorganize the school, which has about 2,700 students, into four autonomous theme schools, with separate administrators, directors and teaching staffs, school officials said yesterday.</p><p>Students and staff were told last month that Erasmus Hall as it has been structured for nearly a century would cease to exist in June and would reopen in September as four schools.</p><p>Interior construction work was suspended on Monday, so architects could incorporate the new plans into the long-delayed physical renovation of the school at 911 Flatbush Avenue, said Amy Linden, the Board of Education's chief executive of school facilities.</p><p>Erasmus will become the fourth large, troubled high school to be broken into smaller, more manageable schools. The first was Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, and last fall Mr. Cortines announced he was closing James Monroe High School in the Bronx and Andrew Jackson in Queens.</p><p>The reorganization is aimed at gaining control of an institution that has seemed to be spinning out of control. On Monday, a student with a boxcutter badly gashed five classmates during a hallway battle that raged through several hallways and into a gymnasium. Police announced yesterday that three students had been arrested in the melee, and charged with robbery and assault.</p><p>The Brooklyn High School Superintendent, Joyce Coppin, said that such violent incidents will be easier to prevent once the school is overhauled; smaller schools create closer relations between teachers and students.</p><p>"It should break down the school's anonymity," Ms. Coppin said.</p><p>As the new plans were laid out last month in a letter to a committee of parents and teachers, Erasmus Hall would become four autonomous schools, each under the supervision of a new project director, to be hired this spring.</p><p>The names of the four schools were listed as the Campus High School for Performing Arts at Erasmus Hall, the Campus High School for Humanities at Erasmus Hall, the Campus High School for Business and Technology at Erasmus Hall, and the Campus High School for Science at Erasmus Hall.</p><p>Although Mr. Cortines and top aides have moved rapidly in recent weeks to get the changes at Erasmus under way in time for the fall term, Ms. Coppin said yesterday that the timing of the project was still under discussion.</p><p>"This is a work in progress," Ms. Coppin said. "I am trying hard to get as many people involved in the development of this project as possible."</p><p>Teachers and parents expressed qualified support for the plans, as well as some concerns. "We have to do something to bring Erasmus back," said John Soldini, the teachers union's vice president for high schools. "But I think they should take some more time to plan this, and do it a year from now."</p><p>Fay Douglas-Lane, president of Erasmus Hall's P.T.A., blamed the school's current problems on a lack of parent involvement, the inability of many teachers to keep order, and Board of Education policies that she said have channeled too many violent students expelled from other schools into Erasmus.</p><p>She worried that simply dividing the school might not resolve those problems. 'Total Change'</p><p>"I feel that there has to be a total change in that school," Mrs. Douglas-Lane said.</p><p>She also criticized the imbalance in ethnic composition between students and staff. The student body is 92 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic, and less than 1 percent white, but the principal, Norman Green, is white, and during the 1992-93 school year, eight of his nine assistant principals were white, as were 59 percent of the teachers.</p><p>"We want a staff that is racially more balanced with the students, because we need some role models," Mrs. Douglas-Lane said.</p><p>City Councilwoman Una Clark, whose 40th District surrounds Erasmus Hall, offered qualified support for the plans.</p><p>Photo: Erasmus Hall is to become four schools.
