But in the polarized climate of academic discourse, it was perhaps inevitable that any effort to codify what students ought to know would become a battle.</p><p>To be sure, the National Standards volumes betray certain tics identifiable as academic chic: a disdain for "the passive absorption of facts, dates, names and places"; a preoccupation with "narratives," as if history were a branch of folklore; a determination to avoid "value-laden issues" for fear of being found "elitist" or "hierarchical." And the language often mimics current lit-crit jargon: "The Tempest," for instance, is an opportunity to explore "the prevailing attitude toward cross-cultural contacts with new people -- encountering the 'other.'

                    <p>The guides will no doubt be hotly debated for months. Does Mercy Otis Warren deserve pride of place beside Samuel Adams and Tom Paine? Why six references to Harriet Tubman and not one to Robert E. Lee? When the authors of "World History" ask students to study "changing gender roles during the Renaissance and Reformation," to "role-play a discussion between an upper-class Hindu and a Muslim about their reaction to British presence in India in the late 19th century," it's not hard to imagine the responses they invite. But the method is true to the spirit of the enterprise: namely, that our understanding of history is subject to change.</p><p>Revision is the essence of history-writing. As Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia who participated in a focus group for the National Standards project, points out, many scholars now believe that ending World War II didn't require dropping atomic bombs on Japan; the 1950's were characterized as much by racism and McCarthyist repression as by suburban bliss. "There's never a moment when a historical question is settled, about which over time there is not some debate," Mr. Brinkley said. "The process of revising and reinterpreting history is what historical scholarship is all about."</p><p>To look back at history is, in a sense, to look back at the writing of history. An entire generation of historians, from Avery Craven to J. G. Randall, interpreted the Civil War as an "avoidable conflict." In the 1960's, diplomatic historians like Gar Alperowitz, Gabriel Kolko and Walter Lefeber maintained that the cold war was more than a response to Soviet aggression; the United States had its own global designs. "You can name virtually any field of history and find revisionists," Mr. Brinkley said. "There were New Deal revisionists, Lincoln revisionists, Eisenhower revisionists."</p><p>In emphasizing formerly "disenfranchised" peoples and cultures, the authors echo the revisionist progressive historiography abroad in the land, which casts America in a grim, even malevolent light. When Columbus's discovery was marked a century ago, as Richard Bernstein wrote in his new book, "Dictatorship of Virtue," the nation was celebrating its own founding, "the starting point for a prolonged epic of freedom, progress, and, not incidentally, the subjugation of 'savage tribes.' " The quincentennial, he noted, was "close to the inverse of the quatercentenary," an occasion for soul-searching about collective national crimes.  Slaves and Peasants</p><p>Even the vantage of the historian has been revised. The old history, "history from above," scrutinized kings, presidents, political leaders and thinkers. The New History, as it's known in the trade, looks at the anonymous masses: slaves, peasants, ordinary citizens. Popular culture, the plight of women and the oppressed have become a legitimate subject of inquiry.</p><p>There's nothing new in this. Radical interpretations of history -- especially others' history -- are themselves a natural development in historiography. "It is all too easy to idealize a social upheaval which takes place in some other country than one's own," wrote Edmund Wilson in the introduction to a new edition of his classic, "To the Finland Station," seeking to justify his sympathetic portraits of revolutionary figures who had since been discredited. "So Englishmen like Wordsworth and Charles James Fox may have idealized the French Revolution, and so men like Lafayette may have idealized our American one."</p><p>As any student of psychoanalysis knows, idealization leads to desecration. What goes up must come down. The current fashion for questioning the old historical "narratives" may well come to be seen as symptomatic of an era when history was in the grip of a fanatical reformist zeal. Why, future historians might wonder, was historical scholarship in the '90's so out of step with its times? Why was it so militantly progressive when the mood of the country was so conservative? (Witness last week's election results.) Was it because liberal ideology had become so "marginalized" that the only place it could find was in the academy?</p><p>Just asking. The point is that revision itself is no bad thing. As Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. argued in "The Cycles of American History," it's "an essential part of the process by which history, through the posing of new problems and the investigation of new possibilities, enlarges its perspectives and enriches its insights." All history is revisionist.</p><p>Or, as Oscar Wilde put it, "The one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it."</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
