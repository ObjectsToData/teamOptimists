As Alexis de Tocqueville once predicted: "Democratic nations will habitually prefer the useful to the beautiful, and they will require that the beautiful be useful."</p><p>The current pressure on the arts to be useful increasingly causes those who support them to measure their value by outreach programs, children's projects, access for the handicapped and artists in schools.</p><p>Given the limited resources available for both social and cultural programs, the humanitarian agencies that disburse grant money no doubt believe that a single dollar can fulfill a double purpose, just as many contemporary artists would prefer their works to function not only as a form of self-expression but also for the public good.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This is surely true not only of Federal, state and civic cultural agencies, where the arts are vulnerable to populist political pressures, but also of most private funding organizations. In a recent issue of the newsletter Corporate Philanthropy Report, an unidentified contributions manager is bluntly quoted as follows: "We no longer 'support' the arts. We use the arts in innovative ways to support the social causes chosen by our company."</p><p>With a few significant exceptions (most notably the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Shubert Foundation), large and small private foundations now give their money not to general support as in the past but overwhelmingly to special programs conceived by the officers of the foundations. Active rather than receptive toward the choices of artists and the programming of artistic institutions, the foundation world is now engaged in what can only called coercive philanthropy.</p><p>For example, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, which handed out $45 million to the arts in 1993, describes its three-year program for resident theaters thus: "To expand their marketing efforts, mount new plays, broaden the ethnic makeup of their management, experiment with colorblind casting, increase community outreach activity and sponsor a variety of other programs designed to integrate the theaters into their communities." What the foundation fails to "expand" or "broaden" or "sponsor" is an artistic goal.</p><p>Similarly, the Rockefeller Foundation, once among the most enlightened supporters of artists and artistic institutions, now disburses about $15 million annually in the arts and humanities division, mostly to scholars and occasionally to artists if their work "can advance international and intercultural understanding in the United States." To judge by recent annual reports, the phrase alludes almost exclusively to African, Asian, American Indian and especially Hispanic countries and cultures. Only 8 out of 87 grants for 1993 could be construed as escaping these categories, while the largest award, almost $2 million, went to the International Film/Video Program, which enables video artists to "create work that explores cultural diversity."</p><p>As for the Ford Foundation -- its dynamic arts division under W. McNeil Lowry in the 60's and 70's was largely responsible for the enormous explosion of nonprofit dance, theater, symphony and opera companies (including many racially diverse institutions) -- the diminishing arts budget ($5.5 million in 1993, out of $54 million for education and culture) is intended to "enlarge opportunities for minority artists and to strengthen minority arts institutions."</p><p>There is no doubt that a lock-step mentality rules philanthropic fashions: today's flavors of the week (or decade) are cultural diversity and multiculturalism. Even the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, originally devoted to rewarding "genius" regardless of race or ethnic background, now has a largely multicultural agenda.</p><p>Of the four grants awarded to performing artists this year (three to gifted people of color), the only white male recipient is a "theater arts educator," whose main qualification for genius was to have founded "a theater company for inner-city children of Manhattan's Clinton Neighborhood and the Times Square welfare hotels."</p><p>It is difficult to criticize this kind of philanthropy without being accused of insensitivity to minorities. But it may be a serious error to assume that all the foundation dollars being poured into developing diverse audiences are successfully democratizing American culture. What we need is rigorous documentation regarding the impact of these grants.</p><p>My own experience suggests that what typically attracts minority audiences to the arts is not mass infusions of audience development money, or even special racial or ethnic projects. Rather, it is the quality of the art itself, though quality is now considered a code word for racism or elitism in most philanthropic circles.</p><p>The best way to stimulate appreciation for quality is through arts education in the schools, an area that has been unconscionably neglected. Effective projects like the Teachers and Writers Collaborative, of New York City, in which poor kids are introduced to language and poetry by practicing poets, are rare and privately subsidized. No wonder the infrequent visit of a dance company on a grant often leaves children baffled and sullen when the system employs so few full-time arts teachers to stimulate their imaginations.</p><p>Whatever its impact on education or its success in minority communities, the new coercive philanthropy is demoralizing many artists and artistic institutions. The entire cultural world is bending itself into contortions in order to find the right shape for grants under the new criteria. Like other institutions that poorly perform the new calisthenics, my own theater has received no money for its customary activities from Ford, Rockefeller and Wallace for more than four years.</p><p>In a typical stab at conformity, a "diversity initiative consultant" was recently hired by a major symphony orchestra in my community to induce "cultural awareness" and to sensitize perceptions of the "diversity of cultures in your work environment."</p><p>Given such pressing needs at home, it is understandable why philanthropy should rush to the aid of minority groups clamoring for recognition through creative expression. But to ask the impoverished agencies of culture to compensate for the failures of society is to divert attention from the systemic inertia and mismanaged social programs of our legislators.</p><p>By forcing artistic expression to become a conduit for social justice and equal opportunity instead of achieving these goals through basic humane legislation, we are distracting our artists and absolving our politicians.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
