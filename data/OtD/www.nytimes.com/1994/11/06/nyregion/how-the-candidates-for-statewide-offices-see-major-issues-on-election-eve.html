                    <p>The political races of '94 are almost run, and along the way, the candidates have spoken hundreds of thousands of words -- in speeches, debates, mailings and advertisements. Often, though, dialogue on the issues of governing has been overshadowed by discussion of other matters, some substantive, others less so.</p><p>Here is a look at the key issues in the four statewide races -- for Governor, Comptroller, Attorney General and United States Senator -- and what the major candidates have said about them. ISSUES: RACE FOR SENATE IN NEW YORK Daniel Patrick Moynihan Personal: Democrat. Senator, elected 1976. Served in the administrations of four Presidents -- Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. Views On Qualifications For Office: A self-described "Al Smith Democrat," he offers nearly four decades in public life, three terms in the Senate, and the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, wielding power over taxes, Social Security and trade -- half the Federal budget. On Abortion: Supports a woman's right to abortion. Of Ms. Castro's financing proposal, he asked, "Does anybody really think that makes a difference?" and noted that the states pay the cost of Medicaid-financed abortions. On GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): He is a staunch advocate of the international agreement, which is one of President Clinton's highest legislative priorities and would lower tariffs by an average of 40 percent to promote exports around the world. He calls it "the largest tax cut in history and the culmination of 60 years of American trade policy." Bernadette Castro Personal: Republican. Former chief executive of Castro Convertibles Views On Qualifications For Office: Calls herself a "Christine Todd Whitman Republican," and says she would offer an alternative to Mr. Moynihan's approach to government, including holding the line on taxation. On Abortion: Says she supports a woman's right to abortion and Medicaid financing for poor women; however, she says those who oppose abortion should be allowed a check-off on their Federal tax returns stipulating that none of their payments go to finance it. On GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): Says she is favorably inclined toward GATT, although she fears that the agreement might lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs, especially for unskilled workers. ISSUES: RACE FOR GOVERNOR Mario M. Cuomo Personal: Democrat. Governor, elected 1982. Lieutenant Governor, 1979-82. Views On Economy And Taxes: Has called for a package of tax cuts that would be worth up to $1.7 billion, but has not disclosed details about how long he would take to cut taxes by that amount, how he would structure the reductions and how he would pay for them. Favors reducing the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 7 percent for single people earning more than $13,000 but less than $50,000 a year and for married couples earning more than $26,000 but less than $100,000. In addition, would increase the state's credit on the income tax for those who pay a large proportion of their income in property taxes, and would cut the state's tax on utility revenues, known as the gross receipts tax, from 4.25 percent to 2 percent. Would insist that the savings be passed along to ratepayers and not kept by the utilities. On Crime: Opposes the death penalty on moral and practical grounds, but supports a referendum that would give voters a choice between the death penalty and his preferred maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Supports life without the possibility of parole for third-time violent felons. Favors banning assault weapons, with provisions to allow collectors and target shooters to own them under certain circumstances. Favors eliminating the state law requiring prison time for second felony offenders, saying that more drug treatment is needed for many such criminals. On Welfare: Would gradually expand his program to force many welfare applicants to search for work before they are placed on the rolls. Would expand the Child Assistance Program, which gives some welfare mothers financial incentives to pursue child support orders from fathers and to find work. Would expand the state's workfare program. Would require children of welfare recipients to go to school and to live at home. Would expand fingerprinting of welfare recipients to the entire state. On Abortion: Supports abortion rights and Medicaid financing of abortions without restrictions. On Education: Would revamp the state's education aid formula to drive more money to New York City, which has 37 percent of the state's students and receives less than 35 percent of state aid. Favors special schools for the state's brightest students. Supports reducing state regulations over schools and offering them more local control. Would abolish the Board of Regents and give the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children. George E. Pataki Personal: Republican. State Senator, elected 1992. State Assemblyman, 1984-92. Mayor of Peekskill, 1981-84. Views On Economy And Taxes: Has proposed a tax-cut package that would be worth $5.6 billion by the fourth year. Says it could be financed by cutting waste in state government agencies, keeping growth in the state budget to the rate of inflation, and revenue growth of 6 percent a year. Has not provided detailed plans for spending cuts. Would reduce the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 5.9 percent, while raising the annual income for the top tax bracket from $26,000 to $50,000 for married couples. Would keep the bottom rate at 4 percent. Would replace the current $1,000 exemption for dependents with a tax credit of $200 for each dependent. Would raise the earned income tax credit for lower-income working people to 20 percent of the Federal earned income tax credit immediately rather than waiting until 1997, as is required under a law passed this year. Has called for a variety of cuts in business taxes, but has not actually proposed any specific measures. On Crime: Favors the death penalty for murderers. Would end parole and work release programs for violent felons. Would require mandatory prison terms for those who use a weapon in the commission of a felony. Favors an absolute ban on assault weapons. Supports more prison construction if it is needed to house felons. Opposes rescinding the state law that requires prison time for second-time felons, even if their crimes were nonviolent. On Welfare: Would require more welfare recipients to work in public sector or community service jobs like cleaning highways and government buildings. Would threaten welfare families with the loss of their benefits if their children do not attend school. Would increase use of managed care in the Medicaid program. Would eliminate certain services provided by the state's Medicaid program, but has only identified a few. Supports statewide fingerprinting of welfare recipients and other measures to combat fraud. On Abortion: Says he unequivocally supports abortion rights, but acknowledges that he has changed positions on the issue twice. Favors a state law requiring notification of the parents of girls under 16 who seek abortions. Opposes Medicaid financing of abortions unless it includes mandatory counseling on birth control. On Education: Would cut the Education Department bureaucracy, but has not said how or by how much. Supports abolishing the Board of Regents and giving the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children. Favors increasing state aid to schools, but refuses to say if he believes the state's education aid formula is fair to New York City. B. Thomas Golisano Personal: Independent-Fusion. Founder, in 1971, of Paychex Inc., a Rochester company that prepares payrolls for small businesses. Views On Economy And Taxes: Says the state's business climate is ruinous principally because of a state and local tax combination that he says is 45 percent higher than the national average. Over the next 10 years, he says, the tax burden must be reduced to no more than 5 to 10 percent above the national average, which would produce a tax cut even more dramatic than Mr. Pataki's. Wants to cut spending by about 50 percent over a decade, but beyond targeting welfare and Medicaid, has not been specific about where the cuts would come from. On Crime: Proposes what he calls a "holistic approach" to crime, primarily by improving the state economy. Beyond that, proposes tougher sentencing for violent criminals and more emphasis on rehabilitation in prison, and would sign the death penalty into law. Has talked about decriminalizing certain drugs, but now says he wants to study the issue. On Welfare: Says the state attracts welfare recipients because its welfare benefits are too generous compared to those of other states. Proposes cutting benefits substantially to match other states', as well as slashing administrative costs. Wants to reduce benefits for welfare recipients who have more than one baby, and to structure benefits to encourage teen-age mothers to live at home, rather than in subsidized apartments. On Abortion: Supports abortion rights On Education: Supports a sliding tuition at state colleges and universities, based on the applicant's ability to pay, as well as greater local control of schools. ISSUES: RACE FOR COMPTROLLER H. Carl McCall Personal: Democrat-Liberal. Minster, United Church of Christ. State Senator from Manhattan, 1975-79. Deputy delegate to the United Nations, 1979-81. Citibank vice president, 1985-93. New York City Board of Education president, 1991-93. Appointed Comptroller, 1993. Views On The Office: Sees audits as "management tools" to save money in state and local government. Would like to expand the Comptroller's role in the budget process by giving him the authority to approve revenue projections. Wants to use the pension fund to help finance job creation while still insuring a good return on investment. Debt Reform: Prime sponsor of a debt-reform package that would limit the state's total debt and restructure the way money is borrowed. It would allow the Governor and Legislature to approve billions in debt without voter approval - the amount would be tied to the total personal income in the state - but would also end fiscal gimmicks like "back-door borrowing,' in which public assets are sold to a governmental authority that can issue bonds on its own. Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes, especially on businesses, state takeover of local Medicaid costs and consolidation of governmental service. Also wants to expand audits of school districts. Wants new rules that would prohibit state spending untile a budget is passed. Herbert London Personal: Republican Conservative-Right to Life. John M. Olin professor of humanities at New York University, where he was dean of the Gallatin Division for 20 years. Conservative Party candidate for New York City Mayor, 1989. Conservative Party candidate for Governor, 1990. Views On The Office: Has called the Comptroller's job a "think tank" for changing government and advocating for tax cuts. Wants to use the office to re-examine governmental structure and efficiency, including overlapping local jurisdications. Believes that the Comptroller should have a larger role in forcing the Legislature and Governor to deliver more responsible budgets. Debt Reform: Opposes Mr. McCall's proposal. Says its debt ceiling is too high and believes that voters should approve all debt related to capital projects for the state and its authorities. Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes and creating a better enviroment for business. Has spoken in favor of greater privatization of governmental services, a Medicaid takeover, increased competitive bidding and the introduction of school vouchers, starting with special education. ISSUES: RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL Karen S. Burstein Personal: Democrat. State Senator, 1973-78; member, State Public Service Commission, 1978-80; executive director, State Consumer Protection Board, 1980-83; president, State Civil Service Commission, 1983-87; New York City auditor general, 1987-90; Family Court judge in Brooklyn, 1990-April 1994. Views On Role Of Attorney General: Maintains that the Attorney General is not a "super prosecutor" whose mission is to fight street crime. But has promised to be a "crusader" on domestic violence by helping to coordinate prevention efforts in the state. Has also said that she will focus on civil rights cases, environmental crimes and fraud against consumers and the elderly. On Abortion: She is a longtime supporter of women's rights, including the right to abortion, and says that she would vigorously enforce abortion laws, including a new Federal law giving state attorneys general broader authority in guaranteeing access to abortion clinics. On Death Penalty: Opposes the death penalty, arguing that it does not deter crime, but says she would enforce it if it were to become law in New York State. Dennis C. Vacco Personal: Republican. United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, 1988-93; chief of the grand jury bureau, Eric County District Attorney's office, Erie County, 1978-82. Views On Role Of Attorney General: Believes that the Attorney General ought to be given a greater role in combating crime. He has promised to lobby the Governor and the State Legislature for tougher anti-crime laws. On Abortion: Is personally opposed to abortion, but says that he, too, would work to enforce abortion laws. On Death Penalty: Favors it and says he will work to persuade the Governor and the Legislature to adopt a death-penalty law.</p>                </div>
