                    <p>At best, these profit-making universities help students advance in their careers, offering courses in education, business and computers as well as subjects not taught at regular universities, like herbal medicine and hypnotism. At worst, education experts say, they are merely postal addresses, where students send their credit card numbers and get a receipt and a diploma in return.</p><p>Some of the institutions are not inspected by any accrediting agency, and the result is that students are awarded meaningless degrees, said Henry A. Spille, co-author with David W. Stewart of "Diploma Mills: Degrees of Fraud," published in 1988.</p><p>Mr. Spille, who is vice president and director of the American Council on Education's Center for Adult Learning and Educational Credentials in Washington, said his book devoted a chapter to California because of its large number of fraudulent degree-granting institutions. 'Innocent Public Can Get Hurt'</p><p>"You have to ask, To what use are people going to put such degrees?" Mr. Spille said. "The innocent public can get hurt. People just see the degree. They don't ask many questions about whether the school is accredited or who recognizes the accrediting body."</p><p>Around the country, such private proprietary colleges and religious universities are the subject of increasing scrutiny. Some proprietary institutions take in students, help them get federally backed loans and graduate them without any particular skills for the workplace, Federal education officials say.</p><p>The students cannot find work and default on their loans, the officials say, and the institutions have borne little responsibility until now. Administrators have been found to fraudulently use Federal student aid for everything from buying themselves Mercedes-Benzes to supporting drug habits.</p><p>In response, Congress passed legislation mandating that each state set up an agency to look into colleges and other institutions that receive Federal money through Pell grants for students or guaranteed student loans. Going an Extra Step</p><p>California had already taken the additional step of starting an agency to regulate the nonaccredited colleges that receive no Federal aid. Worried that the state's many degree-granting nonaccredited institutions were diluting the worth of diplomas from the state's accredited universities, the California Legislature created the Council of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education in 1990.</p><p>The council's job is to review each of the 3,000 vocational schools and 270 private degree-granting institutions in the state in which more than 50,000 students are enrolled. A team of educators conducts the reviews.</p><p>"From my standpoint, a degree should be a degree," said Dr. Kenneth A. Miller, director of the council. "I expect someone who has a degree to have certain skills. Before the changes in the regulation, someone could be given a degree based on work experience or minimum work."  7 Closings Are OrderedSchools Told to Close</p><p>The reviewers use 16 criteria, including fiscal stability, admission standards, curriculum and faculty and scholastic regulations. Seven of the 47 institutions reviewed so far have been told to shut down. Most have appealed the decisions to the council, which is essentially seeking a second review; some have filed lawsuits challenging the council's authority.</p><p>Pacific Western University in Los Angeles was told to shut its operations on Aug. 3 after 18 years of operating a correspondence school, awarding bachelor's, master's and doctorates in a variety of fields, including business and psychology. The university, which says it has 1,000 students in this country and abroad, has appealed the decision, said Dr. David Burke, the academic dean. Meantime, it has moved its headquarters to Hawaii.</p><p>"It's not about academic integrity," Dr. Burke said of the review system. "It's about the big traditional universities wanting to hoard all the students."</p><p>Kensington University, based in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, also had its right to do business in California taken away by the council. The university won a court stay of the order to shut down, however, and is operating pending a hearing before an administrative law judge, said Alfred A. Calabro, the university president. The hearing is to determine the validity of the council's finding.</p><p>Serving about 500 students locally as well as in Japan, Kensington calls itself a "distance-learning school," saying its students receive instructions in law, business, education, psychology and engineering by videotapes and telephone calls. The university has been criticized for its generosity in awarding college credit for work experience because it gives at least 25 credits for work out of the 120 needed for a bachelor's degree.</p><p>But Mr. Calabro defended the practice, saying the university's students were 30 to 50 years old and should have credits for their experience.</p><p>While "there are some phony schools around," Mr. Calabro said, Kensington is not one of them.</p><p>"We have an accelerated-learning program," he said. "Students get the same courses they would get at a college, but we cut out the fat. You don't need to read a whole book -- just what's relevant. And you don't need to sit in a classroom with a 19-year-old who has other things than learning on his mind." One-of-a-Kind University</p><p>In the fall, the state council's review team will visit More University, which has a mailing address in Lafayette, east of San Francisco.</p><p>Lilyan Binder, the university's chief administrator, said her institution's curriculum of communication, sexuality and group living could not be found anywhere else in the United States.</p><p>The university awards only a few degrees, Ms. Binder said, but wants to keep its university status as recognition for the academic research it does on group living. While such research has not been published, she said, the university has been instrumental through its group classes in changing attitudes about sex and making it more acceptable to talk about things like orgasms.</p><p>"The climate has changed in California," Ms. Binder said. "Once there was an openness to emerging fields of study, but they want to cut down on that now. The council has a job in protecting chicanery or diploma mills, but they don't know what to do with us."</p><p>Photo: A California institution with a different vision of higher education, More University offers classes like Basic Sensuality. It has houses around the country in which staff members and students live while teaching, learning and conducting research on communication, human sexuality and group living. The house at center is in the San Francisco Bay Area. (John Koopman/Contra Costa Times)</p>                </div>
