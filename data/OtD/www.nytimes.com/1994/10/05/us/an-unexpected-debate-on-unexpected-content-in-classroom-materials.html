The policy was put together earlier this year by Hunter Rawlings 3d, the university president, who thought he was disposing of a divisive issue by rewriting a proposed policy by the State Board of Regents that would have permitted students to receive alternative assignments instead of reading about or seeing &quot;explicit representations of human sexual acts&quot; in classroom material.">

The policy has arisen from debate over sexually explicit films shown in the classroom.   The policy was put together earlier this year by Hunter Rawlings 3d, the university president, who thought he was disposing of a divisive issue by rewriting a proposed policy by the State Board of Regents that would have permitted students to receive alternative assignments instead of reading about or seeing "explicit representations of human sexual acts" in classroom material."></div>

And the university is divided into the academic equivalent of armed camps, with the humanities cluster the most militant. Students and professors have established a Campaign for Academic Freedom and declared several campus buildings a "free zone" in which the policy will not be followed.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"What we are about is leaving what happens in class up to the instructor," said Thomas Lewis, an associate professor of Spanish and Portuguese who serves as co-chairman of the group opposing President Rawlings's policy.</p><p>Several professors interviewed here this week said there was almost no end to the number of literary works that students would have to be warned about under the current policy. They mentioned that they would need to give warnings for Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Rabelais, Proust, Beckett and virtually any modern novelist.</p><p>President Rawlings, a tall, angular Virginian and professor of classics, said in an interview Monday that he would prefer to have no policy statement governing a professor's use of classroom materials. But he said it was an accomplishment to have substituted vague language for the more specific Regents policy.</p><p>"I, for one, am relieved we don't have a policy on sexually explicit materials, or any other policy which is content-based," he said. "It doesn't say a faculty member can't teach what he or she wishes to teach."</p><p>The issue dates back to the fall of 1991 when three German language classes were shown a critically respected German film called "Taxi Zum Klo" ("Taxi to the John"), which depicts the life of a gay teacher in Berlin and includes an incident of child molesting. One or two students complained to the campus correspondent for The Des Moines Register, who wrote a story about the screening that was published on the newspaper's front page.</p><p>After an investigation, Gerhard Lowenberg, then the dean of the college of liberal arts, concluded that students had not been adequately alerted to the potentially disturbing nature of the film. He asked the department to provide students with printed materials which might avoid such clashes in the future.</p><p>The matter simmered for two years as the local county attorney conducted an inquiry to see if an obscenity law had been broken (he determined it had not). The Iowa Civil Liberties Union raised the issue of censorship, and students and faculty members filled pages of the campus newspaper with their debate.</p><p>In February 1993, a teaching assistant showed a class in art history a short art film that includes 20 seconds depicting oral sex. A student's mother complained to news organizations and to the university's Board of Regents.</p><p>In this case, Judith Aiken, who was then the dean of liberal arts, required the head of the department of Art and Art History to apologize to the class and warned faculty members to keep student sensitivities in mind when planning courses.</p><p>By September of 1993, after the university's Faculty Senate tried and failed to devise a universitywide policy for such material, the Regents decided to take action.</p><p>President Rawlings was among those who had argued vehemently against the Regents policy and wrote the compromise, which the Board of Regents almost immediately accepted.</p><p>But the matter would not die. The student newspaper, The Daily Iowan, filled its columns with angry protests. An editorial in a current issue of the Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies likened the faculty's predicament to Kafka's pathetic land surveyor, K, who lives "an unofficial, totally unrecognized, troubled and alien existence."</p><p>On Monday night, about 75 students and faculty members assembled in the student union to voice their anger at the president's policy, and plan a protest rally on Oct. 19 outside the hall where the university's governing Board of Regents will hold its next monthly meeting.</p><p>The university provost, Peter Nathan, also acknowledged that he was unhappy with the present policy. "Somewhere down the line," he said, "I hope the Faculty Senate will develop a less onerous policy and that the Regents will accept it."</p><p>Marvin S. Berenstein, a Sioux City lawyer who is president of the Board of Regents, said that he did not consider the current policy "overly burdensome" and that while the Regents had no plans to change it they would "certainly consider any ideas for revision" that the Faculty Senate may have.</p><p>Mr. Berenstein said accusations that he was a homophobe were particularly unfair since he "campaigned very diligently for the university's same-sex health insurance policy as far back as April 1992."</p><p>At least one faculty member said he felt that the Rawlings policy gave him even greater academic freedom than before.</p><p>Richard Fumerton, chairman of the Department of Philosophy, said: "Once I've warned my students I've built a wall around academic freedom and students have no basis for any complaint."</p><p>Professor Lewis, who is a former chairman of his department and a former executive director of the Midwest Modern Language Association, dismissed Professor Fumerton's comment as "a cute rationale for not confronting the real underlying issues here."</p><p>"The Rawlings policy," Professor Lewis said, "is subtle and sinister. It forces you to stigmatize what you teach."</p><p>While many students interviewed between classes earlier this week seemed chiefly interested about the football game against Indiana University at Kinnick Stadium on Saturday, all were aware of the debate.</p><p>"The current policy is a form of censorship," said Emily Gersema, a freshman from Radcliffe, Iowa.</p><p>Laroi Dean, a world studies major from Cedar Rapids, said, "I can see two sides to the issue."</p><p>Michael Pollack, a sophomore from Iowa City who signed the petition opposing the policy, said: "They should state in the application form that if you go to this university you may have to sit next to someone who is unusual or unexpected."</p>                </div>
