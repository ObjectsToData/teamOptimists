                    <p>First Lady's Garden Updates</p><p>It's doubtful that Jacqueline Kennedy, when she conceived of a First Lady's Garden at the White House, envisioned it filled with 20th-century sculpture. Formal 19th-century garden statuary, perhaps, but nothing so bold as a black and red Calder mobile or a voluptuous woman by Gaston Lachaise or even a skinny, abstract white-painted bronze figure by Louise Bourgeois.</p><p>But time and tastes change. For Hillary Rodham Clinton, sculpture is not simply a favorite art form, it also has romantic connotations. Her first date with Bill Clinton was at the sculpture garden of the Yale Art Gallery.</p><p>As a gesture of support for contemporary art, Mrs. Clinton decided that a series like "20th-Century American Sculpture at the White House" was just what the First Lady's Garden needed. It is to include four sculpture exhibitions organized by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House and the Association of Art Museum Directors. The first show, "Statues Into Sculpture," was installed last week in time for Arts and Humanities Month, and will be up until March 1. It was financed by the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Foundation, and represents only the second time that 20th-century art has been shown at the White House; the first was a show of Andrew Wyeth paintings during the Nixon Administration.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The 12 sculptures on view were chosen from art museums in the Midwest. "It occurred to me the best way to organize this was to divide the shows geographically," said J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and head of a sculpture subcommittee that is part of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. "We decided to start with the Midwest since that's where Hillary is from." The other shows will exhibit sculpture from the West, South and Northeast.</p><p>George W. Neubert, director of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, is the curator of the show, under the auspices of the Association of Art Museum Directors. Works by such artists as Ms. Bourgeois, Bryan Hunt, Ellsworth Kelly, George Segal and Louise Nevelson provide an overview of American sculpture's development in this century. "I selected almost equally between figuration and abstraction," Mr. Neubert said, and added that half the works are from living artists. "All evoke references to nature and the human figure."</p><p>At the show's opening reception, Mrs. Clinton said: "Now some of the finest American artists and their art will be available to an entirely new audience. The thousands of visitors who pass through the White House each day will be able to look out the Colonnade windows and will be able to share in the esthetic beauty and the emotional power of these sculptures."  Expansion at the Whitney</p><p>For the Whitney Museum of American Art, expansion 90's-style means never having to tamper with the exterior of its 1966 Marcel Breuer building.</p><p>This summer, the Whitney bought a six-story brownstone at 33 East 74th Street in Manhattan, around the corner from the museum, for $3.4 million and announced it would move its library, archives and offices there from the museum's fifth floor.</p><p>The plan, which is being presented to the museum's board for final approval on Nov. 9, involves increasing the exhibition space 30 percent by turning most of the museum's fifth floor into 7,500 square feet of galleries. Since the walls of the two buildings touch, the museum will break through and create an interior connection to the brownstone.</p><p>The plan is quite modest compared with the 1985 design by Michael Graves, the Princeton-based architect, which called for a 134,000-square-foot addition at a cost of $37.5 million. It would have provided space for galleries, retail space and offices, but also would have radically altered the Breuer exterior.</p><p>The new plan is both smaller and much cheaper. David A. Ross, the museum's director, estimated the cost of acquiring the new building and renovating it at $8 million to $10 million. The money is to come from a capital campaign drive, he said, which will begin officially in about three years.</p><p>A substantial portion of the money has already been raised, said Gilbert C. Maurer, president of the Whitney. "This is a doable project," he said.  "The idea is to put back on display much of our permanent collection, like our Hoppers and O'Keeffes, so that people can see them again and again."</p><p>Richard Gluckman, a Manhattan-based architect who has designed SoHo galleries and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, will design the new galleries and the brownstone renovation.</p><p>Mr. Ross said he hoped that work on the brownstone would begin this winter. "We don't want to interrupt any of our activities," he said. "It will be a clean, two-step procedure." Entry Fee for Giacometti Show</p><p>Charity, these days, begins in the gallery. At least it does at Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street in Manhattan. When a retrospective of work by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti opens next Thursday, take your wallet. There will be an admission charge: $5 for adults and $2 for students and the elderly. The proceeds will go toward the cost of mounting the exhibition. (The admission charge does not include the color catalogue, which costs $35.)</p><p>The announcment is raising a few eyebrows in the art world, since most gallery shows are free to the public.</p><p>"It's to defray the large costs of the show," said William Acquavella. "Charging admission also controls who comes." Mr. Acquavella said that in the past he had charged admission to benefit a charity; this is the first time he has done it to cover his costs.</p><p>"What great exhibitions are out there that you can see free?" he said. "Trying to bring an exhibition like this to the public is a service. It costs less than going to the movies."</p><p>While few galleries have mounted as extensive a show of the artist's work, there have been a couple of fine Giacometti exhibitions in New York recently, one at the Yoshii Gallery on West 57th Street in June and another at the Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue in April. Both were free. Pace Executive Leaving</p><p>Other Manhattan gallery news: After 14 years at Pace Gallery, now Pace-Wildenstein, Renato Danese, its executive director and vice president, is leaving. He is becoming a partner in C&amp;M Arts, the gallery founded last year by Robert Mnuchin, a retired partner of the investment firm Goldman Sachs. Jennifer Vorbach, the gallery's director, will also become a partner, Mr. Mnuchin announced.</p><p>Photo: "Observer" (1947-49), by Louise Bourgeois, is among the 12 sculptures currently on view in the First Lady's Garden at the White House.
