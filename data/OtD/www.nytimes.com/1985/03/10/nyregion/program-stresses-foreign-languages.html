Herbert Allen, a senior, is a star lacrosse and football player. He is also in his second year of Greek and has studied Latin since the sixth grade.   A classmate, Arabella Livba, takes Italian, French and Latin and plans to add German and Spanish in college. Madeline Fan, a senior, studies French and Chinese. For her senior project, a program in which students can take time off for individual work, she will study Chinese at the University of Shanghai.   For these students, studying a second and sometimes a third language during high school (Hackley also has elementary and middle schools) is not particularly unusual. They are among the 43 students at Hackely - about 11 percent of the upper-school student body - who are enrolled in two or more languages. Faculty and students credit Donald Barr, the school's headmaster, for offering the the variety of languages and giving his support to the program.">

                    AT the Hackley School, an independent school in Tarrytown, foreign-language study is flourishing. Herbert Allen, a senior, is a star lacrosse and football player. He is also in his second year of Greek and has studied Latin since the sixth grade.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A classmate, Arabella Livba, takes Italian, French and Latin and plans to add German and Spanish in college. Madeline Fan, a senior, studies French and Chinese. For her senior project, a program in which students can take time off for individual work, she will study Chinese at the University of Shanghai.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For these students, studying a second and sometimes a third language during high school (Hackley also has elementary and middle schools) is not particularly unusual. They are among the 43 students at Hackely - about 11 percent of the upper-school student body - who are enrolled in two or more languages. Faculty and students credit Donald Barr, the school's headmaster, for offering the the variety of languages and giving his support to the program.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''When I came here 10 years ago, the languages in the upper school were Latin, French, German and Spanish and occasionally a little Greek,'' Mr. Barr said. ''I thought it was high time for some variation and extension, so I formally added Greek and Mandarin Chinese to the Classics Department and Italian and Russian to the Modern Language department''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Noting that ''there has been and continues to be a certain prejudice in favor of French,'' Mr. Barr said that he had to overcome the initial reluctance of parents to encourage their children to take what they think of as difficult ''high risk courses,'' such as Russian and Chinese. While many more have enrolled in these languages, French still attracts the greatest numbers, he said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Chinese and Russian have reputations of being exceedingly difficult, and it took a while for families to realize that even in the terrible terms of college placement, the exotic languages are more profitable for kids to study. Everybody can offer French, but how many kids can say, 'I'd like to major in Chinese.' ''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    According to Peter Gibbon, director of the upper school, ''the extensive language program has dramatically increased student enrollment in two languages, some in three. That means many of these students take six courses, because you frequently cannot do two languages with just five courses.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Having a strong language program is a matter of philosophy for Mr. Barr. ''We're a Western-civilization school; we're not a marketing school. We don't teach what is currently fashionable or popular or economical. We think there is a central core of things kids should be acquainted with and it involves stretching to some other cultures and modes of expression.'' All students in the school must complete a three-year language requirement in one language in order to graduate.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This year, Stephen Lindberg, who teaches Chinese, has 11 upper-school students in his classes. ''This is an elective for them, so you get kids who are interested in language and not afraid of the so-called myth about its difficulty,'' Mr. Lindberg said, speaking of the Chinese language.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    One important aspect of the language program is that students can continue as far as they want. ''If a student is doing well in a language or in any subject,'' Mr. Barr said, ''he can't run out of courses; that is, if there is only one student who wants to take sixth-year Chinese and the student has a reasonably good record in Chinese, we will offer it. There is no cut-off in any subject.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    According to Mr. Gibbon, this approach ''takes a certain amount of courage for the headmaster.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''It's expensive for the school,'' he explained, ''and he has to hold down three salary lines for very small enrollments.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Mr. Barr, who recalls that he had ''quite an unsuccessful time with foreign languages in his own education,'' said he believes that learning a foreign language helps students educationally in many ways. ''It not only affects your cultural range but also enables you to think more deeply and analytically about language itself, because you have a comparison point, a point of reference.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Zarmik Moqtaderi, a senior who is taking French 6, Latin 6 tutorial and Greek 3, said her language study had made her increasingly aware of the relationships between languages. ''Originally, French helped me with Latin and now I see how everything seems to be linked to everything else, especially in Latin and French, where there are a lot of comparisons,'' Miss Moqtaderi said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For Arabella Livba, studying languages has sparked an interest in their roots and origins. ''The further you study language, the better base you get in the grammatical structures,'' said Miss Livba, who would like to study Old English in addition to modern languages at college.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Hackley students can start language in either the sixth or seventh grades. According to Thomas Tuthill, who teaches sixth-grade Latin, a select group of students is permitted to enroll in Latin at this point. He emphasized that the element of fun in the beginning stages of learning a language was a help in encouraging students' interest. ''They start doing a lot of grammar and I throw a lot of mystery words at them. There is a lot of give and take in the classroom. For them, it's a game.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This year, 54 upper-school students are enrolled in Latin and 11 in Greek. John McAuliffe, who heads the classics department and teaches five courses in Latin and Greek, observed that his good students in those languages were ''pretty good straight across the board: youngsters who have trouble in Latin are usually going to have a problem in math. The problem is the same - it's a problem of logic,'' Mr. McAuliffe said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Sixth graders also receive exposure to foreign language through ''Introduction to Language,'' a course that presents six weeks each of several different languages, such as French, Spanish, Latin, Russian and German. Regular language study starts in the seventh grade.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The culture of the countries whose language is studied receives particular attention in the program. ''At Hackley,'' said Maag Mitton, who teaches Spanish and French, ''the cultural aspect is not separated from the grammar.'' Students often back up their language study with a related literature course. For example, Jordan Frankl, a senior in Russian 4, is also taking ''Russian Literature in English,'' where he is reading, ''Crime and Punishment.'' In his Russian class he reads parts of the book in the original.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Nicolai Tchertkoff, who teaches Russian and French, also underscored the importance of learning the language and understanding the culture and the people. He noted recent reports that discuss the decline in the study of Russian (27,000 Russian scholars in 1965 compared to 5,000 currently). He hopes to encourage future Russian scholars at Hackley and start by getting rid of false assumptions about the Russian language and people.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    To further reinforce the language program, Hackley recently formed an association with Marymount College and Sleepy Hollow High School, both in Tarrytown, and the Lakeland School District in Shrub Oak. Through ''Academic Alliances,'' a program sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, these schools will share resources, ideas and leadership with the goal of improving the teaching of foreign language and the strengthening of the humanities.        </p>
