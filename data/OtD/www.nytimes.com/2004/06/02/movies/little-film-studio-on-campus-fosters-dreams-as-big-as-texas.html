But if the University of Texas has its way, that whole graduate-and-get-a-job part might become incidental.</p><p>The university's film program, with the help of what it describes as an army of lawyers, has recently joined forces with investors to form its own tiny independent movie studio in this central Texas city.</p><p>No American film school has ever tried such an ambitious foray into commercial filmmaking, and the project is being watched with great interest, and great skepticism, in academia and Hollywood. Previous ventures by film schools, even in a small way, have not worked out well. In the mid-1990's the University of Southern California began a program to help its graduates make low-budget movies. But the program produced only one, which never found a theatrical distributor.</p><p>In part the University of Texas's movie idea is a bid to join the top ranks of film schools. The program here has always been well regarded -- and has turned out some famous graduates like the director Robert Rodriguez and the actor Matthew McConaughey -- but it has never been as successful as programs at New York University and the University of Southern California, for example, at placing graduates in the industry.</p>                </div>

                    <p>So over the next three years the university says it plans to make at least eight movies, some with budgets of more than $3 million, that it hopes will attract distributors and moviegoers around the country. To underscore its seriousness, it has attracted several well-known movie names to serve on the film program's advisory board, including Mr. McConaughey, Richard Linklater and Mike Simpson, an executive vice president of the William Morris Agency, which has agreed to help find distributors and backers for the movies.</p><p>The university also says that, in a kind of coup, Terrence Malick, the reclusive director of ''Badlands'' and ''Days of Heaven,'' will be one of the producers on its first movie. The intention is to give the 1,000 film students here -- both undergraduates and graduate students -- a better education by letting them work alongside professionals on the sets and in the production of the movies. But the plan will not work unless the university succeeds in doing something that countless ambitious and smart moviemakers try and fail to do every year: make money.</p><p>''We're making this up as we go,'' said Thomas Schatz, a film historian and professor who came up with the idea. ''But we wouldn't have done it if we weren't sure we could make movies that will make some money.'' He and others in the project say they hope to make good art-house-type films, but they would not be disappointed at all if they happened to stumble across the next ''Blair Witch Project.''</p><p>Along the way there have been countless practical hurdles in figuring how a publicly supported university can make potentially profitable movies. In a recent interview Dr. Schatz said with a smile that ''as far we know it's all legal.'' But the plan has raised questions, some of which have still not been answered.</p><p>For instance, can a student profit if a movie he helped write becomes a hit? The university has said no; it is an educational experience, and it will own the rights to the work, in much the same way that computer-science departments often own technology created by their students.</p><p>''These students are not going to get points,'' said Ellen Wartella, dean of the College of Communications, referring to a percentage of the profits. But what about sequel rights? ''We're still working on that issue,'' she said.</p><p>And what happens if movie unions, which have become stronger in Austin as the city has become more popular among filmmakers, object because students are taking jobs from their members?</p><p>''I think they're going to have to understand the concept of cultivating new members through this, and cut us some slack,'' said Carolyn Pfeiffer, a veteran producer who was hired from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles to run the film program's movie company, called Burnt Orange Productions. ''I think they want to do that.'' (The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents set designers, sound technicians and other set workers, said it was in talks with the university.)</p><p>The idea is also to capitalize on Austin's increasing visibility as a moviemaking city, now called the Third Coast'' (though sometimes with condescension). Over the last several years many movies -- including ''The Alamo,'' ''The Rookie'' and Mr. Rodriguez's hugely successful ''Spy Kids'' series -- have been made in or around Austin.</p><p>Dr. Schatz, the former chairman of the university's department of radio, television and film, said that because of this growing movie scene, he had long felt the program should follow the lead of medical and architecture schools in forming commercial partnerships, not only to better educate students but also to make money for the university.</p><p>''It's been going on with technology for a long time,'' he said. ''But we just don't think about the arts and humanities that way.''</p>                </div>
