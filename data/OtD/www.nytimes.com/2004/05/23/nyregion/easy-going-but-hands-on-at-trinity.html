Jones, the new president of Trinity College, was telling one of his newest stories: an employee of Trinity College attended a reception in early April for scholarship recipients and their donors.

''Never enough.''</p><p>The stranger was Dr. Jones.</p><p>He laughed as he told the story, partly because the woman was horrified when she discovered whom her aside was directed to, partly because the brief discourse was as telling of Dr. Jones's past as it may be of his future. Building endowments is one of Dr. Jones's strengths, a skill he has mastered. He has an intellect and savvy at enticing alumni, parents, friends and employees given to musing aloud at receptions to part with their dollars for the good of the school.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Jones will be stepping into an academic leadership arena that has had its share of controversy in the last few years, from the recent retirement of Richard Judd from Central Connecticut State University after he was accused of plagiarism, to the resignation in 2003 of John Shumaker, a former president of Central Connecticut State, from the University of Tennessee after questions arose about his spending. University of Massachusetts President William M. Bulger also gave in to pressure to resign last year after news reports surfaced about his brother, a fugitive who was indicted for racketeering and 21 murders. Presidential hopscotch has been played often lately at private schools, too, particularly at Trinity, where four presidents, including the popular Evan Dobelle, have left office within the last five years. That beats the national average (5.3 years) for the length of time a private school president typically serves.</p><p>One student leader said the constant changes had not helped the campus.</p><p>''Needless to say, it's been an erratic three-year stay at Trinity with a changeover between four different presidents and acting presidents,'' said Patricia Allen, a junior at Trinity. ''Students could have established a strong rapport and contributed enormously to improve existing programs. Instead, the administration was too wrapped up in resolving its own internal instability problems.''</p><p>While at Trinity, the charismatic Mr. Dobelle pushed the State Legislature for $175 million and the state's power brokers for several million to create Hartford's Learning Corridor, grand new buildings that include an elementary, middle and high school, a job-training center, a Boys and Girls club and a social service agency. On campus, he rehabilitated dormitories and expanded and renovated the library and the performing arts center. He also pushed for increased student involvement; by the time he left Trinity, more than half its students were performing volunteer work in the community.</p><p>Dr. Jones is known for taking a gentle approach, unlike his predecessor, Richard Hersh, an outspoken reformer who Trinity hired to fix its perceived reputation as a party school and who was pressured to leave after one year.</p><p>The new president is a connoisseur of 18th-century culture who speaks French, Italian and Latin and who holds degrees from Columbia, the Sorbonne, Emory and the University of Virginia. He is an affable professor of humanities who said he would as much spend his days dissecting Rousseau as he would leading an academic institution. Dr. Jones has, in fact, spent many days dissecting Rousseau, writing numerous published articles and papers bearing such ominous titles as ''On Names as Masks: Rousseau as Renou,'' and ''Rousseau and the Failure of Autobiography.'' But he is not without his fun, as evidenced by a lecture he gave at a teachers' conference, ''Bending Ears and Changing Horses: Clich&eacute;s We Do Not Need in Class.''</p><p>Even though Connecticut has been straggling behind some states in its economic recovery, Dr. Jones said he is optimistic about increasing Trinity's $340 million endowment. By comparison, Yale University's endowment is $11 billion.</p><p>''We need to raise a lot of endowment money,'' Dr. Jones said. ''I would never have thought it possible to double the endowment at Kalamazoo, but we did. It occurred within three years of the country being in a deep recession. People were not very fortunate in their campaigns. We were.''</p><p>At Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo in Michigan, where Dr. Jones was president from 1996 until his official departure this summer, he used the money to champion building initiatives and support faculty causes.</p><p>''He tends to go above and beyond the minimum necessary and he does it with great style and ease,'' said Barry Ross, a professor of music at Kalamazoo who is familiar with Trinity from time spent in Connecticut earning degrees from Yale University and the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford. ''I'm very proud of him for moving to a larger school where his career will take leaps above what it was here.''</p><p>Talk to Dr. Jones, though, and leaps and bounds are far from his mind. If Trinity is happy with him, he said, he will stay put.</p><p>''I don't play the hopscotch game,'' he said. ''They've had a rough go of it here. I'm trying to learn the poetry of Trinity and I'll just keep doing it until I succeed.''</p><p>For Trinity, Dr. Jones is an unknown quantity. For one longtime mentor, though, he is anything but. Dr. John Wesley Chandler, a former president of Williams College, discovered Dr. Jones when he was chairman of the department of Romance Languages at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Chandler recommended that Dr. Jones take a vice provost position at Southern Methodist University, then the president's job at Kalamazoo College.</p><p>''The people at Trinity knew me,'' Dr. Chandler said. ''Jimmy's record at Kalamazoo was crucial. The fund-raising that he did there, the way he related to students; he knows a huge number of them, and the respect accorded him by students and by other constituencies as well.''</p><p>Dr. Chandler paused a moment, then chuckled.</p><p>''After people hear his name, they have often asked me if he's a football coach or a southern evangelist,'' he said. ''Yes, I call him Jimmy. And I think he has the qualities one looks for in chief academic officers and presidents.''</p><p>Trinity is anticipating his arrival, Ms. Allen said.</p><p>''I'm hoping that Jones will continue a more Dobell-ian reign.''</p><p>Kalamazoo is lamenting his departure.</p><p>''He's a real hands-on person,'' Professor Ross said. ''He really took charge of everything, from the food service to the fund-raising. He will be very missed here.''</p><p>Photo: Dr. James F.
