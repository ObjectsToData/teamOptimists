                    <p>Behind the move is Bill Stanley, a former state senator and now the president of the Norwich Historical Society, and his wife, Peggy.</p><p>''Twenty five years ago, the janitor took us to see the crypt,'' said Mr. Stanley, who is 74. ''There was debris in front of it, and only a painted message on the wall. I think we both shed a tear. We thought of the good he did. How he saved America before he betrayed it.''</p><p>The couple, after an effort spanning more than two decades, finally got permission to install a proper headstone over the vault where Arnold lays buried with his wife, Margaret Shippen, and their daughter, Sophia Matilda Phipps.</p><p>The granite stone, which is two and a half inches thick and stands 30 inches high, was made by Rock of Ages in Graniteville, Vt. -- which was partly chosen to pay homage to the Green Mountain Boys who helped Arnold and Ethan Allen take Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. The Stanleys, who paid more than $15,000 for the stone, have included their names on the bottom as the benefactors. The stone, weighing about 160 pounds, will be installed May 22 at St. Mary's Battersea in London amid ''pomp and circumstance as only the British can do it,'' Mr. Stanley said.</p><p>A scallop shell graces the top of the stone, traditionally the symbol of rebirth. Below is a laurel wreath, meant to convey honor. On the stone Arnold is referred to as the ''Sometime General in the Army of George Washington.'' After the names and dates, the headstone reads: ''The two nations whom he served in turn in the years of the enmity have united in enduring friendship.'' The writing is surrounded by reliefs of olive leaves, a symbol of peace.</p><p>More than a gravestone, the marker stands as a symbol of Mr. Stanley's life work. In 1948, when he was in school, Mr. Stanley wrote an essay claiming that Arnold was the most valuable American who ever lived. Mr. Stanley's teacher promptly had him suspended. But the paper was the impetus of a lifelong commitment for Mr. Stanley, and he has been working ever since to offer a balanced perspective of the infamous traitor from his hometown.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that Arnold should be viewed in such favorable light.</p><p>''I think he deserves the bad reputation which, generally, American historians have assigned to him,'' said Richard D. Brown, a board of trustees distinguished professor of history at the University of Connecticut in Storrs and director of the Humanities Institute.</p><p>While Mr. Stanley has admitted in the past that Arnold's reputation could be used as a tourist magnet, it also seems to him that the stone will convey the appropriate honor Arnold is due.</p><p>''He was a good man,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''A brilliant general. Yes, he was a traitor, after our cause was won. But there ought to be room in our hearts to tell the truth about Benedict Arnold.''</p><p>Yet the subject still tends to be a bit touchy, especially in and around Arnold's hometown. After he turned coat in 1781 and was given a command in the British army, Arnold ordered an attack on Fort Griswold in Groton and watched as New London's waterfront burned.</p><p>''New London would never honor him,'' said Sally Ryan, the municipal historian for the city of New London. ''There's no excuse for a traitor, someone who turns on his own people.''</p><p>That sentiment was echoed recently when the stone was unveiled to the public at Otis Library in Norwich. A man calling himself Sir Anthony Lonardelli picketed outside with a sign reading in part: ''Who cares about the traitor's headstone?''</p><p>''Can we forget about Groton and New London? When he came up the Thames?'' said Mr. Lonardelli, a Korean War veteran.</p><p>But Patrick Gaylord, also of Norwich, expressed a different view as he stood staring at the stone on display in the library's window.</p><p>''Every life deserves a gravestone,'' Mr. Gaylord said.</p><p>Insisting Arnold is a ''tragic figure'' of Shakespearean proportions, Mr. Stanley said his traitorous actions should be viewed in the context of the times he lived. Stanley said he hopes that some day history will take a softer stance against Arnold in light of his many accomplishments. Mr. Stanley -- and most historians -- rank the Battle of Saratoga as Arnold's greatest feat.</p><p>He stopped the British from cutting American forces in two at Albany and secured a great victory at Saratoga in 1777, effectively turning the tide of the war. Astride a white horse, Arnold fought with his men, even though he had been confined to his quarters and was without a command. He was shot in the leg during the battle and walked with a limp for the rest of his life.</p><p>Mr. Brown said that up until the time he committed treason, Arnold had served with distinction even though his ''mercurial and egotistical temperament made him somewhat of a problem.'' But, Mr. Brown said, his betrayal was ''unforgivable.''</p><p>''The second part of his career, when he turned traitor, seems to me to overwhelm his positive contributions of 1776 and 1777,'' he said.</p><p>Arnold then betrayed the American cause when he conspired with the British to capture West Point and hand over General George Washington. After his plan was discovered, he served under the British against the Americans. His reasons for betraying the cause for independence were many, including the fact that he had recently married a young loyalist, was in debt and had been overlooked by Congress for a promotion.</p><p>Mr. Stanley readily admits that Arnold was a traitor, but he also thinks he should be commemorated for the good he did.</p><p>''The war is over,'' he said. ''We won. The man's been dead for 200 years. If we can forgive the Japanese for Pearl Harbor, can't we forgive him?''</p><p>Photos: Bill Stanley, right, with the new headstone that will be shipped to England for Benedict Arnold's gravesite.
