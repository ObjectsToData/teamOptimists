''Harvard,'' it said in large crimson letters at the top, above her picture. And in smaller black letters: ''Summer School Student.''      The name tag conveys to the world that she is more than just Chynah Tyler, the basketball player, from Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. Now, she is also the girl who is smart and motivated about getting an education. Smart and motivated enough to have gotten up at 6 a.m. every weekday for four and a half weeks to catch the bus across the Charles River to a long day of classes at Harvard.  ">

                    <p>Chynah Tyler, 15, ran her fingers across the laminated name tag that has been her most valuable accessory this summer. ''Harvard,'' it said in large crimson letters at the top, above her picture. And in smaller black letters: ''Summer School Student.''</p><p>The name tag conveys to the world that she is more than just Chynah Tyler, the basketball player, from Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. Now, she is also the girl who is smart and motivated about getting an education. Smart and motivated enough to have gotten up at 6 a.m. every weekday for four and a half weeks to catch the bus across the Charles River to a long day of classes at Harvard.</p><p>''When I put my name tag on, I feel like a different person,'' said Chynah, who is 5 feet 7 inches of lean muscle and energy. ''It's like a magic wand. I feel more confident about my education. Most people don't expect me to be smart because I'm a basketball player and they think basketball players just play sports.''</p><p>Chynah is one of 30 high school sophomores from public and parochial schools in Boston and Cambridge who make up the first class at Harvard's Crimson Summer Academy, an academically rigorous program to prepare students from low-income families in the Boston area for top colleges. The students will continue to receive academic tutoring and guidance from their Harvard mentors and teachers over the coming year and will return to campus for the next two summers.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Each summer, meanwhile, a new group of up to 30 sophomores will join the academy.</p><p>''We want these students to have what upper-middle-class kids have,'' said Maxine Rodburg, the director of the Crimson Academy and of the Writing Center at Harvard.</p><p>So the academy will provide SAT coaching; advice on which high school classes to pursue; help with college applications; and intensive instruction in writing, public speaking, math, science and the humanities. At a time when only 3 percent of students at the most selective colleges and universities come from the bottom-income quartile, and only 10 percent from the bottom half, the summer academy is part of a campaign by Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, to make higher education more accessible to low-income students. (Mr. Summers himself gave the academy students a session on public speaking).</p><p>Since many of the students customarily work in the summer, Harvard gives them a $200-a-week stipend. Each student also receives a laptop computer. Upon completion of the three years, each will be awarded a $3,000 college scholarship.</p><p>There are plenty of stereotypes about urban teenagers who worship at the altar of, say, Adidas sneakers and Rocawear clothes. But to the Crimson summer school students, intent on getting their educations, the ultimate brand name is Harvard University.</p><p>''For my family, the dream is to go to Harvard,'' said Laura Ospina, whose family immigrated here from Colombia.</p><p>When she was small, Chynah Tyler said, her mother, who is a school bus monitor, would drive her and her four older brothers along Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, past the university's red brick buildings, and the throngs of students in Harvard Square. ''She'd tell us, 'That's a great school, an Ivy League school,''' Chynah said.</p><p>Last spring, when her school principal suggested that she and several classmates apply to the Crimson Academy, Chynah recalled being surprised. ''I thought they'd just go to the suburbs,'' she said. ''I didn't think people look for kids in the inner city.''</p><p>The Crimson students, who were selected from a pool of 107 applicants recommended by their schools, had their own stereotypes about Harvard. ''I thought everyone was going to have glasses, and khaki pants,'' said 14-year-old John Lewis. ''I thought they'd all be nerds and chauvinistic know-it-alls.''</p><p>Instead, they encountered Ms. Rodburg, a writer, who put the students at ease by telling them that she had dropped out of Northwestern University as a freshman, in 1968, because she couldn't afford the tuition. Working as a waitress and a Kelly Girl, it took her seven years to graduate, with an degree in English from California State University, Los Angeles, and a nursing degree from Los Angeles City College.</p><p>While other colleges have special programs for low-income students -- the first to complete Princeton's three-year program are heading to 16 colleges and universities this fall -- educators say Harvard's initiative underscores the need to prepare low-income students for college.</p><p>All the students were assigned Harvard undergraduates as mentors, and Mohammed Rezallah, or Mo, a sophomore, was Chynah's mentor. Whenever she saw him when he wasn't teaching, Chynah said, Mo had his head in a book. ''I decided I like reading,'' she said. ''Mo made me want to read.''</p><p>Steven Quinchia talked about how Jerold Kayden, a Harvard professor of urban planning and design, inspired him to see Boston differently.</p><p>As part of Professor Kayden's class, the students drew their own plans for improving the sterile City Hall Plaza. ''It showed me that things can be changed,'' Steven said.</p><p>On the last evening, Chynah, who had been voted class speaker, stood before her fellow students and their families. ''Remember at Thompson Island when we were climbing the ropes?'' she said, recalling the summer's first big test. ''Didn't you feel there was a point where you couldn't keep going? This was what this summer was about -- pushing yourself, going beyond your boundaries.''</p><p>Photo: Crimson Summer Academy students participated in a salsa and hip-hop dance class taught by one of their Harvard mentors.
