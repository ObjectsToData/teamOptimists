Not just any peach but a Frog Hollow Farm peach, coaxed into its fullness by the rich loam of the Sacramento River Delta. A golden peach suffused with a lover's blush, a hint of erotic give at the cleft, its juice sliding down the chin at the gentlest pressure -- it was a peach that tastes the way peaches once did, the way they should. It was the peach with which Alice Waters, the founder of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, the chef who revolutionized American fine dining, imagined she would transform children's lives.    It was Frog Hollow peaches, which can sell for about $5 a pound, that Waters took seven years ago to the first day of summer session at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Berkeley. She was carving an organic garden out of a parking lot next to the playground, planting the seeds for a schoolwide program to promote ecological and gastronomic literacy. One bite of these peaches, she thought, and the scales placed on students' eyes by the false prophets of the junk-food industry would fall away. They would see the folly of their Devil Dog ways and convert to the gospel of lush produce. Like Genesis inverted, the fruit of knowledge would lead them back to the garden of innocence. It didn't quite work out that way. ''They wouldn't touch the peaches,'' Waters recalled. ''They said they were furry.''  ">

It didn't quite work out that way. ''They wouldn't touch the peaches,'' Waters recalled. ''They said they were furry.''</p><p>That was in 1997, and although Waters, a former Montessori teacher who advocates experiential learning, has been subject to a few lessons herself, her near religious sense of mission is undiminished. These days the student-tended garden is a stunning acre. She has also built a cooking classroom at the school, whose students are largely middle- and low-income children of color, with storage cabinets of handmade, recycled materials and compost bins nestling on indigo linoleum. Waters is raising the $400,000 annual budget for these two projects, collectively known as the Edible Schoolyard, through nonprofit organizations, including the Chez Panisse Foundation.</p><p>Last month she upped the ante, presenting a districtwide proposal to the school board that, she says, will ''transform education through the school-lunch curriculum.'' The first step will be a multimillion-dollar 15,000 square-foot dining commons at King. Furnished using renewable materials and serving breakfast, lunch and a snack made from local organic ingredients, it will serve as a model for how she believes the nation, and not just its elite, should eat. (Last year she also started a garden-to-table project at the coincidentally named Berkeley College at Yale, involving the kinds of students who would be more likely than the middle schoolers -- who actually reside in Berkeley -- to become patrons of Chez Panisse.) Her dream is to spread her ideas across the country, as she did with her new American cooking in the 1980's, but this time transcending class and age. By re-engineering schoolchildren's taste buds, Waters says, she can reform America's relationship to food -- to what we eat, how we eat, where it comes from and how it ought to taste.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Waters has always been as much activist as restaurateur. Her passion for simply prepared food using the freshest ingredients first blossomed in the French markets she wandered as a student in Paris, then marinated in the counterculture of 1960's Berkeley. A result was a melding of politics and pleasure. She considers food a vehicle -- the vehicle -- for social change. Rather than parlaying her celebrity into a TV show, a chain of restaurants or a frozen-food line, she has used it to preach conscious consumption, her ultimate recipe for overcoming postmodern alienation and overstuffed lives. She says that if Americans would choose seasonal, organic food grown through sustainable techniques by local farmers, if we would serve caring meals at the family table rather than scarfing Happy Meals in the minivan, we would restore family values, transform our communities and stabilize the environment. We would also enjoy ourselves more. ''There's so much pressure to continue the way we're going,'' she says, ''and no enlightened direction to go the other way. You have to begin someplace.'' She gestures around the middle-school kitchen. ''And I think it's with children. It's right here.''</p><p>One afternoon while waiting to meet Waters, I sized up her competition: the Snack Shack, a dilapidated outdoor stand, is the only place King's 900 students can currently buy lunch. The fare is pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs and nachos -- though calling these greasy items prepared elsewhere, wrapped like airline food, frozen and reheated by those names is an insult to junk food.</p><p>As students from King whirled around, flirting, playing basketball, lolling on the grass, I asked a few of them what they had eaten the previous day. A sixth-grade girl could recall only that she had two doughnuts for breakfast and half a sandwich and candy for lunch. An eighth-grade girl skipped breakfast and lunch altogether and had a Coke after school, followed by a sandwich for dinner. The boys ate more consistently, but the nutritional content was not much better: breakfast was Frosted Flakes or hash browns from McDonald's. Burgers or pizza for lunch. Lots of chicken for dinner. Vegetables beyond carrots or corn were scarce, unless ketchup counts. The closest thing to fruit for many was a bag of Skittles candy. Only two children had eaten balanced meals within 24 hours. This in a town renowned as a foodie's mecca. Nationally, a third of children eat fast food for at least one meal a day.</p>                </div>
