    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="When the Library of Congress first talked to the 76-year-old Polish philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, it was to ask him to nominate candidates for a new $1 million humanities prize. So he was taken aback when the Library later called to tell him he had won the award himself.    If Dr. Kolakowski was surprised, most Americans were probably puzzled; his name is not well known in the United States. But for those who wonder why this philosopher was selected for the first John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Dr. James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, explained it in his announcement three months ago: ''Very rarely can one identify a deep, reflective thinker who has had such a wide range of inquiry and demonstrable importance to major political events in his own time.''

So he was taken aback when the Library later called to tell him he had won the award himself.</p><p>If Dr. Kolakowski was surprised, most Americans were probably puzzled; his name is not well known in the United States. But for those who wonder why this philosopher was selected for the first John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Dr. James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, explained it in his announcement three months ago: ''Very rarely can one identify a deep, reflective thinker who has had such a wide range of inquiry and demonstrable importance to major political events in his own time.''</p><p>Born in Poland and ejected from his university position and from the Communist Party in the 1960's because of his increasingly anti-orthodox beliefs, Dr. Kolakowski in exile became a major figure in the Polish Solidarity movement in the 1980's. His three-volume dissection of Marxism, ''Main Currents of Marxism'' (1978), is considered a definitive work on the subject. But he is also a lucid and engaging essayist whose books and other writings touch on subjects like Spinoza, Kant, modernism, authority and free will, and the relevance of philosophy in everyday life.</p><p>Despite such impressive credentials, Dr. Kolakowski remains a modest man, deflecting personal questions. ''You don't need to know about my life,'' he said in an interview as he sipped coffee in the living room of his house in northern Oxford, where until several years ago he was a research fellow at All Souls College.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Likewise, he declined to reveal just how he reacted to the news of his recent award. Yes, but how about the cash? He looked down at his cup and gave a sly smile. ''I never had great problems with spending money,'' he said.</p><p>The life of Dr. Kolakowski, whose name is pronounced LESH-ehk ko-wah-KUHV-skee, was torn apart twice, first by Nazism, then by Communism. The son of intellectuals, he was moved with his family after the German invasion to a succession of small towns and villages in central Poland and was forbidden to attend school. ''The Germans closed the schools for the Poles,'' he said. ''The great idea was that Poles be swineherds for the Germans and be left illiterate.''</p><p>He nonetheless read widely and surreptitiously and after the war got a doctorate in philosophy from Warsaw University. At first he embraced doctrinaire Marxism as an antidote to Nazism and as a compelling utopian ideal. ''I disliked intensely a certain tradition in Polish culture -- right-wing, clericalist, anti-Semitic -- and belonged to the left milieu during the war,'' he explained. ''After five years of horrors under the Germans, we greeted the Red Army as a liberation.''</p><p>Early on, he says, he could see that what he was signing on to was not what it made itself out to be. But it was not until he went to Moscow for three months in 1950, as part of a program for promising young Marxist intellectuals, that he had his ideological awakening, discovering that Marxism's rich ideological rhetoric jarred with its thin cynical reality.</p><p>''One could see the cultural degradation -- the poor level of intellectual life of the leading luminaries of Soviet science and ideology, the poor level of art and so on,'' he said.</p><p>Back in Poland he rose through the ranks at Warsaw University, where he eventually became chairman of the history of philosophy section, while attacking Marxism in pungent, often satirical writings that put him increasingly at odds with the establishment. He began to argue for a humanist socialism or a socialist humanism, and became the leading thinker behind the ''Polish October'' movement, made up of intellectuals agitating for reform.</p><p>Dr. Kolakowski's influential critique of Stalinism, ''What Is Socialism?,'' was banned by the government, among other writings, but circulated widely among other disillusioned intellectuals. He was ejected from the party in 1966 and fired from his university job two years later. He then left the country, along with his wife, a psychiatrist, and their daughter, taking a visiting professorship at McGill University in Toronto. ''I expected that my absence from Poland would be two years, but it extended to 20,'' he said.</p><p>When the opposition movement began gathering strength in Poland in the 1970's and 80's, Mr. Kolakowski's writings had a pivotal ideological effect on those in Poland and a galvanizing effect on those outside the country, particularly after martial law was imposed in 1981. He plays down his role, though, saying that he was just one of many intellectuals whose writings and political work were influential and that he performed ''small services.''</p><p>At one point he asserted in English that ''I only have one language -- Polish -- although I pretend to speak in various languages.'' (Those are French, German and Russian besides English).</p>                </div>
