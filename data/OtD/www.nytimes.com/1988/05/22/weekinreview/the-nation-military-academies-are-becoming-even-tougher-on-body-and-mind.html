                    <p>Almost 3,000 graduates of the Military, Naval and Air Force Academies will toss their hats into the air in the next couple of weeks at West Point, Annapolis and Colorado Springs, after having finished educations that are among the most rigorous in the United States.</p><p>The three armed forces academies can afford to be highly selective because they are deluged with far more applications than they used to receive. They have strengthened traditional courses in engineering and expanded into the social sciences and humanities, and their ranks have become more diverse with the admission of women and increasing numbers of nonwhite students.</p><p>Officials say standards of physical fitness, discipline and leadership have been raised. Altogether, said West Point's superintendent, Lieut. Gen. Dave R. Palmer, ''the kids who make it here could make it anywhere else.'' Among the 2,000 colleges and universities in the standard guides, the three military academies are now listed as being among the most competitive.</p><p>That coincides with the opinion of Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, who recently visited the Air Force and Naval Academies and plans to visit West Point in September. ''They're back,'' Mr. Bennett said of the academies in an interview. ''Educationally, they have solid programs - tough, demanding, serious, in contrast to what's going on in some other institutions.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Engineering is still the core of the academic curriculum for the young men and women who are potentially the nation's military leaders 25 years hence, but required courses, electives and majors in social science and the humanities have been added. At West Point, for instance, academic majors were started in 1982. Cadets and midshipmen carry six or seven courses a semester, compared with four or five in colleges, packing five years of study into four.</p><p>West Point cadets can major in history, and at Annapolis, an English major can delve into Forms of Poetry or Literature of the American Dream. Col. Stewart S. Duncan, a spokesman for the Air Force Academy, said the curriculum there was now divided about ''50-50 between engineering and the humanities and social sciences.''</p><p>The tradition of academy graduates winning Rhodes Scholarships - there were six in the West Point class of 1959 - continues this year with two cadets from West Point and one from the Air Force. One of the West Point winners, Douglas E. Fraley, plans to round out his education with a summer in Ranger school, perhaps the toughest physical training in the armed forces, before going to Oxford to study philosophy and politics.</p><p>Applications for the academy classes of 1992, now being formed, are at record highs. At Colorado Springs, 16,670 men and women have applied, a 30 percent increase over last year, for about 1,400 places. The Naval Academy has received 15,700 applications, a record for the fourth consecutive year, for about 1,300 places.</p><p>At West Point, 14,700 have applied for a class that will be smaller by 20 or 30 because fewer cadets in the upper classes are flunking out. After an applicant is judged to be acceptable, he or she must also win an appointment from a member of Congress or the President.</p><p>In comparison, Harvard University in 1987 enrolled 1,600 of the 13,654 who applied; the University of Michigan admitted 4,600 out the 17,474 applications, and Stanford University received 16,138 applications for 1,575 places.</p><p>The academies have benefited from a rising interest in military careers and a restored acceptance of military service after a long period of disfavor in the wake of the Vietnam War. (Programs for the Reserve Officer Training Corps, targets of hostility during the Vietnam years, have rebounded as well on many college campuses.) Next year, West Point will commission its 1,000th black graduate. The first was 120 years ago, but 551 have graduated in the last 10 years. One black cadet, Michael K. Barsella, said the current atmosphere was without noticeable discrimination or favoritism. ''You're judged here totally on your merits,'' he said. ''There's no affirmative action, no breaks, no slurs.'' Last semester at Annapolis, a black midshipman, Roger G. Isom, was brigade commander, the highest student officer.  Lingering Resentment</p><p>Women were resented when they were first admitted to the academies in 1976, and some resentment remains. But Cadet Patricia A. Abt, the deputy brigade commander at West Point, said: ''I haven't felt that I wasn't wanted here. I'm not so optimistic as I used to be, but I think most women who have a problem here bring it on themselves.''</p><p>Discipline is strict, of course, but hazing is forbidden now. ''We want discipline here to be demanding but not demeaning,'' said General Palmer of West Point.</p><p>Physical requirements are tough. Everyone spends every afternoon in varsity or intramural athletics. West Point began this year to require each cadet, male and female, to take part in a team contact sport, such as basketball or soccer, for at least one semester. That is intended to teach them to work together, as they will in small units in the field, and to be put at some risk.</p><p>The recent changes at the armed forces academies have not come without difficulty. Attrition rates for women, while falling, are higher than those for men. In the eight classes with women that have graduated from the Naval Academy, for instance, 35 percent of the women left before graduation, compared with 23 percent of the men. Officers at each academy said second-year students, after strenuous ''plebe'' years, are adrift and need more responsibility. Some Army cadets, while agreeing that discipline should not be demeaning, think it has become lax.</p><p>There are faculty members who might disagree, however. The academic dean at Annapolis, Karl A. Lamb, a political scientist educated at Yale and Oxford, shook his head over the pressure on midshipmen who have every minute filled from 7 a.m. until midnight. ''I'd like to see a little more time for them to reflect,'' he said. ''They're short on soak time.''</p><p>On the other hand, he added: ''They hand in papers on time. And nobody has ever occupied my office in protest.''
