                    <p>IN MANY WAYS IT LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL college reunion. People who hadn't seen each other in 20 years were embracing, trading stories of their lives, peering at snapshots of their children - or at the children themselves, for there were lots of kids along: this was a generation that had its children late. Their parents were not only casually dressed, in good 60's fashion, but wore red armbands and flaming red name tags that identified them with buildings on the Columbia University campus - Hamilton, Low, Fayerweather, Math.</p><p>These 40-year-olds were no ordinary graduates reminiscing about dormitory pranks and fraternity parties. They were old revolutionaries back at Columbia to celebrate the storming of the Winter Palace - the brief moment in their hot youth when they had seized control of a major American university. ''This is the most self-important college reunion I've ever seen,'' said Lewis Cole, a writer who was a leader of Students for a Democratic Society in 1968.</p><p>As at most alumni weekends, there were the usual panel discussions. One after another, the old grads got up to talk about what they'd done since 1968, but instead of describing experiences in law or medicine, Wall Street or banking, they talked about working as labor organizers, peace activists, or campaigners for abortion rights or gay liberation. They described trips to Cuba and the Soviet Union and even periods spent underground as fugitives. There was a sprinkling of radical celebrities - Mark Rudd, Abbie Hoffman - and a handful of sympathetic faculty. ''I'm amazed at how many people haven't been depoliticized,'' said Tom Hurwitz, an award-winning film maker. ''Against the odds of a decade of greed and cynicism, an unbelievable number are still involved in socially committed work.''</p><p>They were returning to a school that had recovered strongly from a long period of trauma and austerity, a school significantly changed in large and small ways by the uprising itself. Though no university official was there to greet them, the return was a symbolic reconciliation. Twenty years earlier to the day, these now-mellow alumni had been among the angry students who occupied five buildings on the same campus where they were now exchanging wistful reminiscences. For weeks they had been protesting the university's involvement in defense research and the construction of a new gym on park land that lay between Morningside Heights and Harlem's black community. But no one expected what happened on April 23, 1968, when a noon rally and an orderly march led to a wild attack on the gym site and the spontaneous seizure of Hamilton Hall, the hub of the undergraduate college.</p>                </div>

                    <p>It was one of the largest student uprisings in the history of American universities. Never before, not even in the Berkeley rebellion of 1964, had a college campus been the flashpoint for political issues dividing American society. Within a week, the police were summoned to clear the buildings, resulting in more than a hundred injuries and over 700 arrests. In the year that followed, the students' tactics were imitated on hundreds of other college campuses, as agitation over Vietnam, the draft and black rights turned the groves of academe into scenes of conflict and dissent.</p><p>Famous intellectuals like Dwight Macdonald and Stephen Spender, who had experienced the 1930's, came to Columbia to see the progress of the revolution, as did militant black leaders like H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael. Tom Hayden sat in with the militants in Math, graduate students occupied Fayerweather, architecture students took over their own building in Avery. Blacks, proudly separate and virtually incommunicado, held the fort in Hamilton Hall. Only the blacks were arrested without violence: the administration feared that Harlem would descend on the campus.</p><p>AS A YOUNG ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT Columbia during this period, I was caught up in a maelstrom of nonstop faculty meetings, ideological arguments, petitions, rumors and demonstrations. In record time, students and faculty got the political education of a lifetime. It was an exhilarating, high-adrenaline period: a great deal that we had learned and taught in the classroom - about means and ends, about political power and individual rights, about the aims of the university - was put to the test from moment to moment. Perhaps naively, liberal faculty members turned themselves into mediators, working to prevent police action and bloodshed, shuttling back and forth between the stiff-necked administration and the students, who were just as unyielding.</p><p>''I got caught up in those events without knowing what I was doing,'' says Walter P. Metzger, a history professor who helped organize the faculty effort. ''I was sleepwalking. I sentimentalized the students beyond belief. I didn't understand the black students. But there was one thing I didn't want to happen. I didn't want police to come on campus and use their billy clubs.''</p><p>When the police did come, some of the faculty got their heads bashed, and a number of their colleagues never forgave them. ''Columbia didn't heal for a long time,'' says Allan Silver, a professor of sociology. ''The gulf between the administration and the faculty was very wide.''</p>                </div>
