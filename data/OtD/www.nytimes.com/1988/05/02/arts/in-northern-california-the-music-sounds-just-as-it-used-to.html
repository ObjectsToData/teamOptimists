                    <p>Bustling from cult marginality into the mainstream, the original-instruments movement has attracted greater attention than any other recent trend in the performance of classical music. And no part of the United States has a more active, intensely interconnected early-music community than the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>The movement is devoted to the use of the period instruments and performance practices that prevailed when a score was composed. At a time when most new music strikes audiences as problematic and when an almost nostalgic historicism is sweeping Western culture, musicians and scholars alike seek a spirit of fidelity to the past.</p><p>The world centers of this movement are London, Amsterdam and Paris. In this country, Boston has more instrument makers, New York has more players and Los Angeles has more money. But partly through competitive divisiveness in the East Coast cities, San Francisco has become the most complete center for original-instruments performance in the nation, and hence a model for other cities.</p><p>The Bay Area offers a large, well-organized audience with affluent, educated tastes to support not only concerts but also record sales and radio broadcasts. There is the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, which may well count as the country's leading early-music orchestra and which has inspired the San Francisco Symphony to an unusually active program of 18th-century performances of its own. There is a lively group of top-flight period instrument makers, and a number of resident singers and solo instrumentalists of international renown. There are the local universities, with strong musicology departments. 'The Fuzzy Sandwich Crowd'</p>                </div>

                    <p>Beyond all that, there is a larger aura of post-hippie, environmentally active, health-conscious communality that seems linked with at least the core audience for original-instruments performance. This is a connection that today's original-instrument performers, with their newly cultivated respectability, approach with extreme wariness. But one source of the initial enthusiasm for gently tinkling harpsichords and softly strumming lutes was their perceived purity and romantic charm, which corresponded neatly with the seraphic side of the hippie sensibility.</p><p>Certainly no one can deny the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra's hippie roots. The group gave its first concert in 1982, and in its early years it deliberately did without a music director, preferring instead a happily communal ambiance complete with flamboyant costumes highlighted by what are described variously as ''gypsy'' or ''Lithuanian'' sashes.</p><p>''They were all into health food,'' recalled Eleanor Selfridge-Field, a musicologist who runs the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities in Menlo Park. ''People called them the fuzzy sandwich crowd.''</p><p>Both the orchestra's folkish roots and its new-found sophistication could be observed at a recent Philharmonia concert at the First Congregational Church in Berkeley, devoted to all four Bach Suites for Orchestra. The orchestra now calls San Francisco its home, symbolic of its new national importance. But Berkeley, with its mixture of academia, radicalism and good vibrations, was its birthplace. The concert audience was a diverse one, but to a visitor accustomed to Eastern concert mores, it seemed, with its open shirts, sandals and abundant facial hair, inescapably Californian. Elegant Interpretations</p><p>More significantly, the music-making was first class. The 20-member orchestra played very surely, with some particularly adept flute playing by Stephen Schultz in the Second Suite. Elegant, sensuously inflected interpretations were shaped by Nicholas McGegan, a 38-year-old Englishman who is himself an international early-music-movement star and who has been a San Francisco resident since he became the orchestra's first music director in 1985.</p><p>Today, with its rapidly expanding concert, touring and recording schedule and its big-time budget ($600,000 annually and climbing), the Philharmonia is determined to be counted as ''San Francisco's second orchestra,'' in the words of George Gelles, its first professional executive director. Yet even Mr. Gelles speaks of ''this intense bonding thing between board and audience and players.''</p><p>The orchestra was founded by Laurette Goldberg, a harpsichordist from South Bend, Ind.,, who came to the Bay Area in 1953 and who has taught and played here ever since. Many of the players - the string section, especially, still consists largely of original members - were trained in Amsterdam, including Ms. Goldberg.</p><p>''We had no money, but I knew this community,'' Ms. Goldberg said in her Berkeley home, which doubles as a center called Musicsources for early instruments, performances, teaching and socializing. ''Magic happens directly here. There's not a lot of money like there is in L.A., but money is not important. What's important is sympathy and love and passion for music.'' Academic Involvement</p><p>One key to the evolution of the San Francisco original-instruments scene was the presence of an involved academic community, above all the widely known musicologist, keyboard player and conductor Alan Curtis at the University of California in Berkeley. Another was an assortment of instrument makers stretching from Santa Cruz to Mendocino.</p><p>Rod Cameron is one of the world's leading makers of Baroque transverse flutes - including a couple that Mr. Schultz plays. A Scottish engineer who worked for Rolls-Royce in Glasgow and taught in Mexico and Canada, he said he ''fell in love with a Minnesota farm girl named Kathleen who taught school in San Francisco'' and settled in the city in 1975. In 1984 the two moved up the coast to Mendocino, which he describes as ''a hotbed of small entrepreneurial activity in the arts and crafts.''</p><p>Mr. Cameron stresses the creative interchange between musicians and instrument makers. ''I'm indebted to the fine flutists who live in the Bay Area,'' he said. ''I have my own ideas, but you have to listen very, very carefully to what the player has to tell you. The flute has to be a clear channel in the performer's hand.''</p><p>John Phillips, a former student of Ms. Goldberg's who is now aker of elegantly crafted harpsichords, said that whatever the scene's roots may have been, the players and craftsmen soon realized they had to get serious about their tasks. ''There's a real world, and we had to adapt what we love into a way of living in the 80's,'' he said. Appeal to the Nonspecialist</p><p>Ms. Goldberg accepted the process of professionalizing the Philharmonia's with motherly good grace; it was she who chose Mr. McGegan to be the orchestra's music director.</p><p>Now the concerts are expanding to San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles and beyond, and the orchestra has a busy schedule of recordings on the Harmonia Mundi label. Thus far, the repertory has been Baroque and Classical, with the largest ensemble totaling 48 players. But Mr. McGegan is looking forward to Beethoven's Symphony No. 2 next year.</p><p>''The Philharmonia has made it O.K. for people who ordinarily go only to the symphony to hear strange guys play funny instruments,'' said Mr. Phillips.</p><p>''I have no intention of the Philharmonia being a cult group,'' insisted Mr. Gelles. ''We are a mainstream organization.''</p><p>Photos of Rod Cameron hand-turning a Baroque flute; members of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra rehearsing (NYT/Terrence McCarthy)</p>                </div>
