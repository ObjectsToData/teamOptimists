                    <p>MEDITATION, interfaith expression and social action are some of the watchwords of the Zen Community of New York, which has spent the last few years using its money to live up to its traditions and to develop an unusual program to aid the homeless of Yonkers.</p><p>Although numbering only a few hundred people, the Zen Community has quietly moved into the blighted southwest section and has set as its target for help some of the 450 homeless families in the city. To help achieve its objectives, the group created the Greyston Family Inn a little more than a year ago.</p><p>Headed by Bernard Tetsugen Glassman, a Zen abbot, the Family Inn is not yet an inn in the material sense, but a nonprofit organization with an impressive governing board that includes former Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli, former Lieut Gov. Alfred B. DelBello and leading educators, theologians, business executives, bankers and lawyers.</p><p>''We are looking at ways to provide a permanent solution for the homeless,'' said Glassman Sensei, as the abbot is known. ''This means abandoning the concept of temporary shelter and providing an effective path for the return of the individual to a productive role in society.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>With this in mind, the Zen Community - which recently sold its $1.6 million mansion overlooking the Hudson in the Riverdale section of the Bronx - has purchased an abandoned and derelict apartment building at 68 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers for $250,000, and is converting it into residential units for homeless families. A similar conversion of the city's abandoned School No. 6 a few blocks away on Ashburton Avenue has been delayed, pending approval from the Board of Education and the City Council.</p><p>But Glassman Sensei was quick to point out that the essence of the program for the homeless was job training, accommodation at an affordable rate, employment and the ultimate independence of the once-homeless individual or family. ''Only then will the homeless problem cease to exist,'' he said.</p><p>Already the abbot has trained eight homeless people at the five-year-old Greyston Bakery, which the community began with a $40,000 grant from the Yonkers Private Industry Council and with help from private businesses like W. R. Grace &amp; Company. The Zen Community has also trained four people to help in the reconstruction of 68 Warburton Avenue.</p><p>Glassman Sensei and his wife, the Rev. Helen Glassman, a Zen instructor, have purchased an abandoned home on Ashburton Place, across from School No. 6 and next to St. Paul's Church of God and Christ, and recently restored it to a habitable condition. And William Shubert, another board member, who is a real-estate appraiser, said he was looking for accommodation for himself in the neigborhood as well.</p><p>The Greyston Bakery, a former lasagna factory on Woodworth Avenue near Ashburton, is using its profits to help finance Zen Community projects, the abbot said. Its customers include the Algonquin Hotel, Bloomingdale's, Dean &amp; DeLuca, Godiva Chocolatier, the St. Regis Sheraton Hotel and Sardi's restaurant.</p><p>''It was an executive-on-loan from W. R. Grace that provided us with the marketing and financial advice,'' Glassman Sensei said, referring to Leo Frantzman, who is also on the Family Inn's governing board.</p><p>The abbot is fond of relating the story of how Peter Grace, chairman of W. R. Grace, ordered his corporation to provide the executive assistance for the bakery five years ago while on a whirlwind tour of the bakery.</p><p>''Mr. Grace needed help for his favorite charity, the Cistercian Trappist monks of Snowmass, Colo. He tasted our baked goods and liked them so much he said he would help us if we could teach the monks how to bake at a high altitude.</p><p>''Actually the trick was to give them cooking advice and to tell them to eliminate cakes that had to rise and to concentrate on cookies and similar products instead.''</p><p>The Warburton Avenue building is to contain 18 units - 15 apartments for homeless families and three for staff, with a ground floor reserved for community services such as day care, job training, counseling and a cafeteria and arts programs. The School No. 6 project would contain accommodations for about nine families and 18 individual men as well as additional service facilities, including a theater for arts presentations and programs for the immediate community.</p><p>Glassman Sensei stressed the interfaith aspect of the Zen Community's work and said that there was no proselytizing in the Greyston Family Inn project. On the other hand, for those inquiring into the Zen philosophy, the Zen Community of New York offers instruction in the five basic elements of its tradition: meditation, study, work practice, social action and interfaith expression.</p><p>The abbot, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, explained that he became a Buddhist monk in 1970 after having been introduced to Zen in 1958 and taught by the Zen leader Mae Zumi of Japan, whose picture he displays over a desk in his office. To point out that other faiths are not contradictory to the Buddhist philosophy, he said that his son and daughter had had a bar mitzvah and bas mitzvah.</p><p>Tracing the bakery's origins, the abbot said: ''We were living in Riverdale on donations and were dependent on catering, membership dues and retreat fees. This wasn't enough. We weren't making a living. We wanted to become economically self-sufficent and wanted the 'right' livelihood.''</p><p>The groups's answer came from the Tassajara Bakery of the San Francisco Zen Center. In 1982, four New York monks including Glassman Sensei went to California to learn all aspects of baking. They became so proficient that they were able to convince such baking-equipment suppliers as the Traulsen Corporation of Queens and Adamatic of New Jersey to donate equipment.</p><p>Their work in job training with the homeless has impressed John J. Allen, the county's Commissioner of Social Services. The county's approximately 4,000 homeless fall under his jurisdiction. , Mr. Allen wrote: ''The Community's project provides an excellent opportunity to develop transitional housing and, in the long term, to reintroduce families and individuals into their home community.'' To a large extent, the county houses its homeless in hotels and other facilties outside the county.</p><p>In order for help to come from the State Social Services Department's Homeless Housing and Assistance Program, Mr. Allen must approve of the Greyston Family Inn program. The community has approached the state program for a grant of $500,000 for reconstruction work at the Warburton Avenue building.</p><p>Other grants received include $2,000 from Chemical Bank and $5,000 from Gannett Newspapers.</p><p>Other members of the governing board of the Greyston Family Inn inculde Dr. Nancy Baker of the philosophy faculty of Sarah Lawrence College; the Rev. Lloyd Casson, sub-dean of the Cathedal of St. John the Divine in Manhattan; Julio Gutierrez of the Mamaroneck and Larchmont branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; William Reddy Jr., manager of the Hudson Valley Bank, and Dr. Brian Swann of the humanities faculty at Cooper Union.</p><p>John Nettleton, director of housing for the county's Department of Social Services, is on the housing committee of the Greyston Family Inn, and the Rev. Darryl George, pastor of the Messiah Baptist Church on Warburton Avenue, will join the governing board this month.</p><p>The Rev. Sandra Holmes is executive director of the Greyston Family Inn.</p><p>Photo of former Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli, the Rev.
