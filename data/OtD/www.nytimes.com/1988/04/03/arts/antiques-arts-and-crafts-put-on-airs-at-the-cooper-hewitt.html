                    <p>The most ambitious exhibition ever organized of Arts and Crafts material is also the most controversial, presenting the turn-of-the-century movement as a philosophy, not a style. The show, comprising far more than the robust oak furniture, leaded-glass lamps, colorfully glazed ceramics and woodblock typography usually associated with Arts and Crafts, opens Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, 2 East 91st Street.</p><p>Among the 206 selections on view in '' 'The Art That Is Life': The Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in America, 1875-1920,'' are known classics by Gustav Stickley, Frank Lloyd Wright, Rookwood Pottery and the brothers Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Greene. What is unexpected is that works of the Esthetic Movement, the Colonial Revival and Art Nouveau styles are also represented.</p><p>The selections were made by the organizers, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, in consultation with 14 specialists - art historians, curators, writers and a dealer. The director of the exhibition, Wendy Kaplan, is a former research associate at the museum and was the editor of the show's abundantly illustrated 400-page catalogue, published by Little, Brown &amp; Company ($50).</p><p>The exhibition's premise is that the Arts and Crafts movement was a philosophy, not a style, based on anti-industrial reforms proposed by the English writer-designer William Morris. Morris urged a return to handwork and to medieval attitudes and techniques of craftsmanship. He was also a businessman, who headed Morris and Co., producer of designs that echoed his delight in Gothic tracery, woodblock printing, stained glass and joinery.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The show and its catalogue stress the antecedents of the Arts and Crafts movement and its influence on the post-World War I boom in crafts. The exhibition departs dramatically from earlier museum and gallery surveys of the movement, which have focused primarily on Arts and Crafts as a style influenced by medieval technology and esthetics and expressed in ceramics, metalwork, furniture and lighting.</p><p>Boston's exhibition includes many of these works as well as weighty Victorian furnishings, a Colonial Revival silver tray, Art Nouveau jewelry and a Windsor-style settee copied in the 1920's by Wallace Nutting. Among the 19 works left out of the show here because of such issues as Cooper-Hewitt's limited space are an Edwardian wicker chair and an early-20th-century Empire-style card table with an elaborately carved Art Nouveau base.</p><p>A neo-medieval mood is established at the show's entrance, on the second floor of Cooper-Hewitt's wood-embellished interiors. The setting summons up home libraries of yesteryear, with darkened oak furniture - a squarish bookcase, slat-sided table and reclining Morris chair - a rag rug on the floor and a soft glowing light issuing through the isinglass shade of a hammered-copper table lamp. The furniture here was made by various workshops, including Stickley's; the lamp was made by Dick Van Erp of San Francisco.</p><p>Arranged in showcases and period vignettes in the rooms beyond and on the lower level are more than a score of 19th-century forerunners of Arts and Crafts works and later offshoots of the movement. The exhibition was designed by Todd Zwigard of UKZ, a Yonkers architectural firm, under the direction of Dorothy T. Globus, curator of exhibitions.</p><p>Gillian Moss, an assistant curator at Cooper-Hewitt, who was the show's textile consultant, said the exhibition reflects the large geographical spread of the materials chosen. Works produced in New Orleans differed from those made in Boston -even though the craftsmen in both cities considered themselves to be disciples of John Ruskin and William Morris, she said. ''In each community there was a very individual vision and sense of what they were producing.''</p><p>Was there an Arts and Crafts style? ''Yes,'' she said. ''In textiles, there was huge use of the running stitch in New Orleans and in Boston. It was a signature in embroidery of the style. Today you hardly find anyone using the running stitch.''</p><p>Another hallmark of the Arts and Crafts style was the imaginative modern use of medieval leaded and stained-glass windows and screens by turn-of-the-century architects and designers. The most successful of these interpretations seen in the show are the geometric-patterned leaded-glass windows by Frank Lloyd Wright and the floral patterned stained glass of John La Farge and Louis Comfort Tiffany.</p><p>The exhibition, which opened in Boston a year ago and traveled to Los Angeles and Detroit, will close in New York on June 26. It is sponsored by Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund company, through its Fidelity Foundation, as well as by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Henry Luce Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust.</p><p>The revival of interest in Arts and Crafts period works has propelled prices upward to extraordinary levels. An exception was an umbrella stand identified as a work by Gustav Stickley, which was auctioned for $440 at Sotheby's last June.</p><p>The exhibition includes several works auctioned in recent years by Christie's. A square, leather-covered oak armchair, designed for a bank in Minneapolis by William Gray Purcell, George Grant Elmslie and George Feick Jr., was sold there in 1983 for $18,700. In 1982 a 1900 oak bench with copper hinges and iron details by Charles Rohlfs of Buffalo had fetched $17,600, and a geometric-patterned rug by George Washington Maher of Chicago brought $1,470. A square-legged mahogany and ebony chair, designed in 1907 by Greene and Greene, was sold for $71,500 in 1984.</p><p>Omitted from the exhibition here is a 1903 high-backed oak bench that Gustav Stickley designed for the entrance hall of his Syracuse home and that is to be auctioned at Christie's on June 11. The presale estimate is $30,000 to $40,000.</p><p>The record at auction for any Arts and Crafts work is $594,000, paid at Christie's last June for a dining table and chairs by Frank Lloyd Wright. A drop-front desk designed by Harvey Ellis for Stickley's Craftsman Workshops brought $102,300 last October at Robert Skinner galleries in Bolton, Mass., an auction record for Stickley. The next Skinner auction of Arts and Crafts material, on April 23, will offer a number of Stickley works - a bookcase, a sideboard, chairs and architectural lighting.</p><p>Photo of a chair designed in 1907, which sold at Christie' in 1984 for $71,500</p>                </div>
