                    <p>A battle between bottom-line accountability and artistic judgment, with important portents for the future of arts financing as well as for the present chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was joined today at a hearing of a House subcommittee on appropriations.</p><p>Representative Sidney R. Yates, the Chicago Democrat who for the last 13 years has headed the subcommittee, which originates the annual budget for the endowment, took a strong stand yesterday against the plan of Frank Hodsoll, the endowment's chairman, to require what Mr. Hodsoll says is stricter discipline and greater consistency from the endowment's grant-making panels.</p><p>''I've never seen such a storm created,'' Representative Yates said at the hearing, which was called to consider the endowment's financing. ''Every concerned organization we heard from has expressed opposition to what you're doing.''</p><p>''I thought it was a routine management matter,'' said Mr. Hodsoll. ''That's our fault. We have to communicate better.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>A few minutes later he added, ''But the opposition is for the most part assuming we're going to do something we're not going to do.''</p><p>Unlike most Federal agencies, which use full-time staff employees to make grants or set the amounts, the National Endowment for the Arts has for years recruited panels of independent specialists from the worlds of music, theater, dance and the other arts to select recipients and determine the size of grants. Panel recommendations are almost always accepted, and the panels enjoy the luxury of not being asked to account for any inconsistencies in their frequently intuitive decisions.</p><p>The dispute had heated up last December when, in an effort to allay fears, the endowment released a statement declaring that a revision of its procedures was under way to correct the fact that its panels had not been ''sufficiently consistent'' in relating their judgment as to ''the merit of an application'' to ''the size of the grant award.''</p><p>In subsequent meetings and conversations with representatives of arts organizations, Mr. Hodsoll said that he would ask the panels to explain such apparent discrepancies as why a panel had given a grant to one top-rated arts institution equal to 17 percent of its total budget, and given another equally highly rated institution a grant equal to only 9 percent of its total budget.</p><p>''I didn't say that's wrong,'' he explained the other day, ''but only that the panel gave no rationale. If one of these institutions got more than the others because it has a project that will knock your socks off, then I have no problem with that. I just argued for an articulated rationale.'' An Urging From Pell</p><p>On April 18, Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who helped write the original legislation creating the National Endowment for the Arts and who now heads the Senate Subcommitteee on Education, Arts and Humanities, which overseas the endowment, urged Mr. Hodsoll not to make any change in the panel system ''until you have completed a thorough re-examination of the implications of such a move.''</p><p>Mr. Hodsoll conceded to Mr. Yates that his plan might be politically unwise. ''What motivated me was doing what I thought was just logical,'' Mr. Hodsoll said the other day. ''I don't think we've got anything evil going on here at the endowment, but when spending the taxpayers' money we should have an adequate record to explain what we did after the panels have gone home. Originally, I though this was the most administrative of things, but now it's become a brouhaha. I fault myself. I thought I was doing something of not much importance, but I stepped on some toes.'</p><p>Congressional observers were uncertain as to when or how the dispute might end. Representative Yates, a Democrat, might draw out the hearings or he might follow Senator Pell's suggestion and stipulate that funds appropriated for the endowment in fiscal 1989 be on condition that no change in the present panel system be made. However, it seems unlikely that Mr. Hodsoll, a Republican, can back down completely even though he indicated a willingness to go slower. Today he said it would be ''irresponsible'' for a Federal official such as himself to fail to put into effect budgetary accountablity now that he had ''the tools to do the job.''</p><p>After the hearing, Mr. Hodsoll said, ''I think we can work this through and balance the need for panel judgments with the need for public accountability in spending public dollars.'' Concern From the Start</p><p>Ever since Mr. Hodsoll first proposed the plan last fall, Representative Yates has heard expressions of concern from arts organizations around the country that bottom-line, bureaucractic thinking was about to crowd out artistic judgment.</p><p>Those at the hearing today buttressed their arguments with great sayings. Representative Yates invoked Mies van der Rohe and Barbara W. Tuchman, while Mr. Hodsoll countered with Emerson and Plato.</p><p>The central issue remained whether the endowment's grants panels should be held accountable for their judgments. A number of arts leaders have come to believe that what Mr. Hodsoll was asking would compromise the panels' independence.</p><p>A few arts leaders such as Ardis Krainik, the general director of the Chicago Lyric Opera and a vice president of Opera America, the national opera service organization, wrote to Mr. Yates in support of Mr. Hodsoll, but a greater number sided with Robert P. Bergman, the director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore and the chairman of the Government and Art Committee of the American Association of Art Museums.</p><p>Mr. Bergman said recently, ''Instituting a formula which has budget size as a significant component will result in rewarding larger institutions, or, in the worst case, will reward profligacy and impose cutbacks on medium, small and emerging institutions.'' Yates Wants an Answer</p><p>Consequently, Representative Yates wrote to Mr. Hodsoll and demanded an explanation. Representative Yates's House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior and Related Agencies allocates more than $9 billion a year, of which the endowment's $167 million is less than a drop in the bucket, but Representative Yates, a fancier of Abstract Expressionist painting, has long taken a deep interest in the arts.</p><p>Mr. Hodsoll wrote back to assure the Congressman that no formula had been adopted, but arts organizations continued to shower Mr. Yates with cries for help.</p><p>In February, the advisory National Council on the endowment voted 11 to 7 to let Mr. Hodsoll try his plan, but early in March the dance policy panel, another advisory body, voted overwhelmingly to oppose any change in the panel system.</p><p>Photos of Frank Hodsoll, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; Representative Sidney R.
