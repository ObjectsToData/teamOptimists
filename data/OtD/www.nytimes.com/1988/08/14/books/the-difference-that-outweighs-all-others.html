                    <p>A HISTORY OF THEIR OWN  Volume One. Women in Europe From Prehistory to the Present.  By Bonnie S. Anderson and Judith P. Zinsser.  Illustrated. 591 pp. New York: Harper &amp; Row. $27.50.</p><p>IT is no secret by now that, despite the best efforts of scholars, the writing of history is not and never will be an objective chronicle of facts and dates. The record of the past is always incomplete, and historians who write about it inevitably reflect the preoccupations of their own time. From Herodotus to the present, historians have regularly reminded us of the inadequacies of the work done by their predecessors. In the 20th century the growth of interest in social and economic history has both spawned new methods and engendered a naive faith in the possibility of scientific precision in history.</p><p>Meanwhile, the peoples and practices ignored by an essentially elite historiographical tradition were being brought onto center stage. Peasants, urban crowds, criminals all had their day, and the biographies of towns and villages threatened to replace the biographies of people. The history of mentalites, emanating from Paris, came and went, leaving behind evocative and often titillating accounts of mundane aspects of former times that older historians had judged not worth considering. More recently, in the present atmosphere of candor, sexuality has become as much the province of the historian as of the psychoanalyst. A recent multivolume ''History of Private Life,'' translated from the French, takes us into the bedrooms of the past and opens the doors of every closet.</p><p>These fashions in historiography obviously mirror the interests of the world in which they take shape. The attempt to make up for past omissions in historiography has now become almost frantic, and it is probably in reaction that we begin to hear calls for a return to the old standbys of political history, narrative history and even historical biography. Probably the most important - and certainly, I suspect, the most enduring - work now being done on those whom history forgot can be traced directly to the feminist movement of the last two decades. The male perspective in virtually all history from antiquity to the present is as undeniable as the elite perspective with which earlier generations so often found fault. It is clear that the serious study of women's history has arrived, and we may readily understand why, after several millennia, those who espouse it write with the fervor of missionaries to the benighted.</p>                </div>

                    <p>With acknowledgment to the pioneering work of such leaders as Gerda Lerner and Joan Kelly, Bonnie S. Anderson, a historian at Brooklyn College, and Judith P. Zinsser, who teaches humanities at the United Nations International School, have now delivered the first of two volumes on the history of women in Europe. ''A History of Their Own'' is a noble undertaking and deserves a warm reception. At the same time, neither the authors nor those who have supported their work would wish an enterprise like this to be judged solely on the basis of good intentions. The job was certainly worth doing. The question is whether it has been done so well that we can say with confidence that women really do now have a definitive history of their own.</p><p>This book is a major step toward a general history of European women, but it would be a pity if it became the standard work on the subject. Part of the trouble lies in the concepts underlying the history. The authors insist that, although differences of historical era, class and nationality have some significance in the study of women, these differences are all outweighed by what they call ''similarities decreed by gender.'' Consequently, notions such as the subordination of women and the ''empowerment'' of women are broadly applied over the ancient and medieval periods covered by this volume. The scheme is just too simplistic. This is not to deny that women were systematically and persistently subordinated, or that some women acquired a degree of power through writing (Sappho, Hildegard of Bingen) or, occasionally, through political or military authority (Cleopatra, Joan of Arc). But there is so much more to the picture.</p><p>The weakest part of ''A History of Their Own'' is the relatively short section devoted to classical antiquity. Since many of the traditions and attitudes that prevailed in the Middle Ages were established in this period, it is too bad that the authors did not produce a more profound account. There is no trace, for example, of the important and pioneering work of David Schaps on the economic rights of women in classical Greece. Giulia Sissa's exciting new study of virginity in Greek paganism in her remarkable little book ''Le Corps Virginal'' probably appeared too recently for inclusion, but the issues it raises are scarcely new. The exceptionally enlightened views of Plutarch on women are left out - which could prove seriously damaging in the second volume when the authors have to deal with Europe in an age in which Plutarch was widely read. Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata,'' in which women are seen as the means of bringing peace and good sense to a war-torn world, would have enriched this account of antiquity. Sappho receives her due as a great writer, but the authors here (and indeed elsewhere) tend to minimize the subject of lesbianism, although it would be pertinent to the question of sex roles in what they consider ''empowerment'' situations. The chapter on Christianity is good, particularly in stressing the suppression by the early church of a more favorable view of women in the actual teachings and conduct of Jesus. But this chapter has none of the richness of the work of Elaine Pagels in her ''Gnostic Gospels,'' as well as in a major new work, ''Adam, Eve, and the Serpent.''</p><p>The authors seem far more comfortable in the world of the Middle Ages. Over all, their treatment provides a refreshing change from the current tendency to concentrate on matters of sex and the body in medieval history. The structure of this section is far better than that on antiquity. Here we see in successive detail peasant women, ecclesiastical women, noblewomen and finally townswomen.</p><p>''A History of Their Own'' begins with a reference to the French courtier Christine de Pizan, who wrote at the beginning of the 15th century a ''Book of the City of Ladies.'' She was clearly an inspiration to Ms. Anderson and Ms. Zinsser, and she reappears appositely to provide comment and texture in their account. Christine de Pizan would surely be pleased by ''A History of Their Own.'' The book is an honorable initiative in giving women the history they deserve.</p><p>Illustration showing peasant woman making cheese from 14th century Italian manuscript (from ''A History of Their Own'')</p>                </div>
