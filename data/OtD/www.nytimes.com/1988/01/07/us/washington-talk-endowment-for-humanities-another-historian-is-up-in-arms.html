                    <p>The Reagan Administration is being accused of exercising conservative bias on historical projects through the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>Only a few weeks ago, several prominent historians criticized the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, saying it had emphasized such things as fireworks and ''circuses'' rather than academic projects in the celebration last year.</p><p>Now comes David Thelen, a history professor at Indiana University, who contends that ''right wingers'' in the Reagan Administration have captured the National Endowment for the Humanities, with ominous consequences for the country's academic community. Ideology and Aid</p><p>At issue now is whether the Administration, through the endowment, is rejecting grants to applicants perceived as having less than sufficient credentials as conservatives. More generally, the dispute is also about whether historians should concentrate on the past or the present.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Professor Thelen, who is editor of The Journal of American History, charged that grant applicants must now pass an ideological litmus test. ''The N.E.H. is not supporting good scholarship in American history that focused on the Bicentennial,'' he said, ''and the reason appears to be that that right-wingers are deciding to place ideology above scholarly competence.''</p><p>To the endowment, however, Professor Thelen is ''a disgruntled applicant - a scholar scorned,'' in the words of Marguerite Sullivan, director of the endowment's Office of Public Affairs. She firmly rejected any implication that ideology played a role in the awarding of grants.</p><p>The dispute involves the endowment's rejection of Professor Thelen's request for $13,520.71 to underwrite a special, 562-page double issue of his history journal. A major reason for the rejection, an N.E.H. official wrote Professor Thelen, was that the proposed journal illuminated ''contemporary rights rather than 'originalist conceptions.'</p><p>''Originalist theory,'' which focuses on the original intent of the founding fathers, is expounded by some conservatives, including Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Robert H. Bork, the Federal appellate Judge who was rejected by the Senate as a Supreme Court nominee.</p><p>The dispute has touched off a broader controversy involving the N.E.H. and the academic community. One leading historian said the academic community had adjusted to ideological shifts in various eras, moving from a more liberal approach in the Administrations of Presidents Johnson and Carter to a more conservative approach in the Reagan years.</p><p>''What has been going on throughout the 1980's is that these panels have been heavily stacked by people on the right,'' said the historian, who declined to be named. Professor Thelen's project, the newly published issue of the Journal of American History, is dedicated to ''The Significance of the Constitution for American Development.'' Its contributors include a roster of distinguished scholars, including Walter LeFeber of Cornell University, Morton Keller of Brandeis University and Harry N. Scheiber of the University of California Law School at Berkeley. Cornell University Press plans to reprint the issue in hardback and paperback editions this spring.</p><p>The journal's grant application received a ringing endorsement from Michael Kammen, a profesor of American history and culture at Cornell who is the author of a highly acclaimed constitutional work, ''A Machine That Would Go Of Itself.''</p><p>''I thought it was an excellent project, a worthwhile project,'' Mr. Kammen said.</p><p>The application itself was judged by a five-member panel made up of three historians and two editors of university presses. Panel's Original Vote</p><p>At first, two of the panelists ranked the proposal ''excellent,'' one ''very good,'' one ''some merit, but not recommended,'' and one ''not recommended.'' The panel then met in Washington June 1, and rejected the proposal.</p><p>The panel was headed by Margot Backas, the endowment's assistant director of the texts program. Last September she wrote Professor Thelen, informing him of the reasons the application was rejected.</p><p>''The panelists were at first divided in their opinions,'' Ms. Backas wrote. ''Two found it a well-conceived plan, with essays by some of the best political, legal and constitutional historians in the country, and edited by a scholar who was described by one panel member as 'the best in the history-journal business, with a great sense of innovation and rich imagination.' During the discussion, however, a number of negative points were aired.''</p><p>''One panelist noted that although the idea of a special issue of the J.A.H. on the Constitution was an excellent one, the project description suggested that the editor was more interested in the illumination of contemporary rights than 'originalist conceptions,' which he found an unusual orientation for a journal of history. This concern was then echoed by one of the panel members who had originally supported the project.''</p><p>''Of equal concern,'' Ms. Backas continued, ''was the unusual nature of the budget.'' She said that ''several panelists stated emphatically that public funds should not be used to underwrite what amounts to a free issue of the J.A.H. for the 11,500 members of the organization. The ''originalist'' theory of the Constitution is espoused by some conservatives who believe that constitutional interpretation should strictly adhere to the original intent of the founding fathers and those who adopted the amendments, rather than be guided by contemporary values. It has become a central tenet of Reagan Administration conservatives.</p><p>Ms. Backas wrote that ''because of the unusual nature of the proposal, the staff called it to the attention of the National Council on the Humanities, asking for their guidance.'' In addition, Ms. Backas said, the staff called the proposal to the attention of Lynne Cheney, chairman of the endowment, before she made the final decision.</p><p>Professor Thelen wondered what happened between the panelists' initial enthusiasm for the project and their meeting when they voted it down. ''Something at the meeting in Washington changed their minds,'' he said. ''Something at the meeting caused them to focus on the ''presentist'' and ''originalist'' issues.''</p><p>Ms. Backas responded, ''Sometimes something comes up in the group that changes the minds of some panelists.''</p><p>Professor Thelen said he believed that objections to the proposal on the grounds that it did not adhere to ''originalist conceptions'' of the Constitution represented the interjection of ''right-wing political passions'' into what should be a purely academic process. He said he could not understand why the decision received the unusual scrutiny of the humanities council and the N.E.H. chairman.</p><p>Dr. Herbert London, dean of the Gallatin Division of New York University, who served on the panel, recalled raising the question of the proposal's orientation. ''The emphasis was on present values rather than on historical antecedents of the Constitution,'' he said. But Dr. London said he did not consider that criticism ''political,'' and said he considered himself a ''centrist.''</p><p>Dr. Samuel Gammon, executive director of the American Historical Association, said he did not believe that the endowment applied political litmus tests to grant proposals, but said, ''There is a feeling that they shouldn't go too far in supporting violently left-of-center, or even left-of-center operations.''</p><p>Ms. Backas said the proposal was rejected mainly because it did not envision a broader audience than the journal's readership. She said the panelists, who acted independently, did not believe that the endowment would be justified in subsidizing the journal's subscribers.</p>                </div>
