                    <p>''Virginia Woolf read it, was fascinated by it, and told me to scrap it. So I did. She said that nobody should publish before the age of 30.''</p><p>Woolf's views sound dated today, yet somehow authentically bizarre and Bloomsburyish. They were recalled with good humor the other afternoon by Stephen Spender, the British poet, playwright, essayist and teacher, whose name bridges trans-Atlantic literature. In Manhattan briefly before returning home to London after winding up a teaching fellowship at the University of Connecticut, he was also talking about ''it'' -his first novel.</p><p>The 78-year-old author completed ''The Temple'' was a 19-year-old Oxford student, but it was never published. Now, with an introduction and extensive changes by Mr. Spender, it is scheduled to come out in late spring from Faber &amp; Faber in London and Grove Press in New York.</p><p>The publication of ''The Temple'' -nearly 60 years after it was written -is an occasion because of its origin, time frame and authorship. 'Low, Dishonest Decade'</p>                </div>

                    <p>For Mr. Spender is the last surviving member of the group of British poets who developed in the 1930's, writing in that ''low, dishonest decade'' (in W. H. Auden's phrase) of the Depression and Fascism, appeasement, war in Spain and then all of Europe. They included Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Louis MacNeice and C. Day Lewis. In 1930 the original manuscript of ''The Temple'' was dedicated to Auden and Isherwood.</p><p>As Mr. Spender now tells it, the story behind the novel's rejection -and first publication in 1988 - is part of the changing history of the laws of libel and censorship, and of what subjects have become acceptable for the reading public in a free society.</p><p>''Two years ago, a friend told me that during a visit to the rare-books section of the humanities center at the University of Texas, he had read the manuscript of a novel by me,'' Mr. Spender said. ''It was called 'The Temple' and dated 1929. I had completely forgotten that in 1962, during some financial crisis of the kind to which poets are liable, I had sold the manuscript to Texas.''</p><p>He obtained a photocopy. Reading it for the first time after many years, he thought the 287-page manuscript was more draft than novel. It was written in the form of a first-person journal and was autobiographical. Experimental Sections</p><p>In the novel, the narrator (called ''S'') goes to Hamburg in the summer of 1929 to stay with a young German called Ernst Stockmann. In the first section, the narrator describes various characters he meets in Hamburg that summer. Another section is about a walking tour along the Rhine with a friend called Joachim. Other sections are experimental, including attempts at interior dialogue that lay bare the innermost thoughts of Ernst and Joachim.</p><p>''Rewriting the novel, I changed the time from the autumn of 1929 to November 1932,'' Mr. Spender said.</p><p>''I did so to heighten the contrast between summer sunlight and winter darkness by advancing the date in the second half of the novel to 1932. The encroaching atmosphere of dark politics covering the whole landscape is the night into which my German characters are seen moving.</p><p>Why wasn't it published as originally written at the time? Threatened Lawsuit</p><p>Mr. Spender said: ''I sent a copy to Geoffrey Faber, my publisher. Faber pointed out that there could be a question of publishing a novel which, besides being libelous, was pornographic, according to the law at that time. Without my knowledge, Faber sent a copy to the family in Hamburg whose son was a character in the novel. Their response to him was that they would sue if it was published.''</p><p>In Hamburg, Mr. Spender had become a friend of Herbert List, who he says in a new introduction to the novel was the original of the Joachim character. List was then a young coffee merchant who later became a famous photographer. Now, Mr. Spender has added, Herbert List's name to the dedication page.</p><p>Mr. Spender explained the attitude of the young British writers in the late 1920's and early 1930's on matters of censorship.</p><p>''As a result of the prohibitive laws in our own country, we all defiantly wanted to write about censored subjects,'' he said. ''For example, 'Maurice' by E. M. Forster was such an attempt. So was 'The Temple.' When some of us traveled, including of course Isherwood, whose experiences led to his 'Berlin Stories,' we wanted to see the crudeness of Germany. It excited us more than the stylishness of France.</p><p>''Germany before the rise of Hitler seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives. By contrast, England was the country where James Joyce's 'Ulysses' was banned as was Radclyffe Hall's 'Well of Loneliness,' a novel about a lesbian relationship.''</p><p>Mr. Spender drew a parallel to the American authors who left their country in search of freedom and new experiences.</p><p>''Prohibition resulted in young American writers like Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald leaving their hometowns and going to France or Spain,'' he said. ''For them - drink. For us - sex.'' In originally writing ''The Temple,'' Mr. Spender said he felt very much a part of his generation, exploring the new territory of living identified with a new literature. More Ominous Feeling</p><p>In rewriting the novel for publication this year, he did not tone down what was once forbidden. But by advancing the time to a few years later, just before the rise of Hitlerism, he gives ''The Temple'' a more ominous feeling.</p><p>He said that the character in the novel called Simon Wilmot is a caricature of the youthful Auden and the character called William Bradshaw is patterned after a slightly less youthful Isherwood. But both are much fantasized and changed.</p><p>'' 'The Temple' is now a complex of memory, fiction and hindsight and, of these, hindsight is certainly the most decisive,'' he said.</p><p>The author recalled what his London publisher told him in jest about ''The Temple.'' ''The next time we have a novel written by a 19-year-old author,'' said Michael Evans, of Faber &amp; Faber, ''we'll wait another half-century before publishing it, too.''</p><p>Photo of Stephen Spender (Jonathan Player)</p>                </div>
