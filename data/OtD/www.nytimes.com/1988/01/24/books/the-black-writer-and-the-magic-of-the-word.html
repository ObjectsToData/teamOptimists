                    <p>AT a certain point in my writing career, after I had done three books, I made a decision. I wanted to reach out to readers that the earlier works had perhaps excluded. I wanted to get everybody's ear. I had in mind a book for people familiar with America, with the technique and history of the novel - a book that audience could appreciate and applaud and relate to the Great Traditions, if there really are such things. But at the same time a book my brothers, sister, aunts, uncles, cousins, mother and father would want to read. And in my mind it became quite clear that I wouldn't be writing down to a black audience. My people's lives embrace the whole range of human experience. In fact, the language they speak, refined and tested by centuries of racial oppression and racial assertion, offers a unique vision of America. So it wasn't a question of condescending to a less educated set of readers, but of becoming more ambitious.</p><p>My goal has always been to write as well as anybody has ever written, but I am sure now that for a long time I didn't know what really counted as legitimate subject matter, legitimate language, for such an enterprise. To write the very best, didn't you have to cheat on your past a little, didn't you have to ''transcend Blackness''? Didn't you have to prove yourself by grounding yourself outside a black environment like Homewood, the community in Pittsburgh where I was raised?</p><p>I was university educated, and as you go through schools like the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford University, you get a value system imposed on you. You don't just guess what the best is; people tell you what the best is. Lessons, styles seep in. As I had grown up, a value system had formed; college attempted to put another in place, and so I was not consciously turning my back on blackness, I was just becoming acculturated, and the acculturation pushed my writing in predictable directions.</p><p>When I began to teach literature in college, I taught what I'd learned: books by white authors. Then, about 1967 or 1968, I took a summer and part of a year to develop a course in Afro-American literature. I went from a very superficial acquaintance to an absolute immersion in black literature. Afro-American literature courses have become a special love. And my writing has absolutely been transformed by my study of Afro-American writing and culture.</p>                </div>

                    <p>FOR seven years between books, I was exploring voice, doing a lot of practicing, studying, ''woodshedding,'' as the musicians would say - catching up. I was learning -relearning may be more accurate - a new language with which to talk about my experience, a language I used in my novel ''Damballah'': ''Hey man, what's to it? . . . ain't nothing to it something to it I wouldn't be out here in all this sun you looking good you into something go on man you got it all you know you the Man hey now that was a stone fox you know what I'm talking about you don't be creeping past me.''</p><p>Afro-Americans must communicate in a written language which in varying degrees is foreign to our oral traditions. You learn the language of power, learn it well enough to read and write but its forms and logic cut you off, separate you from the primal authenticity of your experience, experience whose meaning resides in the first language you speak, the language not only of words but gestures, movements, rules of silence and expressive possibilities, of facial and tactile understanding, a language of immediate, sensual, intimate reciprocity, of communal and self-definition.</p><p>Houston A. Baker Jr. in ''The Journey Back,'' a study of Afro-American writers and culture, speculates on the ex-slave Frederick Douglass's autobiographical narrative: ''The voice of the unwritten self, once it is subjected to the linguistic codes, literary conventions, and audience expectations of a literate population, is perhaps never again the authentic voice of black American slavery. It is, rather, the voice of a self transformed by an autobiographical act into a sharer in the general public discourse about slavery.'' He goes on to ask, ''Where in Douglass's narrative does a prototypical black American self reside?''</p><p>Does an Afro-American necessarily lose contact with an authentic self if he or she decides to tell a story in print, in a second acquired tongue? Are the only options silence or fatal compromise?</p><p>For hundreds of years black people have been speaking English. Beginning as a pidgin or trade language on the west coast of Africa, then transformed to a creole as a second generation of Africans was born on American soil, the English that black people speak has a distinct history, intertwined but always systematically in tension with the standard or mainstream variety of English spoken by newscasters and other imaginary Americans. The key word is ''systematically.'' Since language and culture are symbiotic, if we can begin to describe systematically the kinds and quantity of distance between speech patterns and standard norms, we also will be defining the roots of Afro-American culture. And if we can identify the means Afro-American writers employ to keep the oral roots of black culture alive and kicking in our fiction, we can perhaps find that place in our writing where Houston Baker's prototypical black American self resides.</p>                </div>
