                    <p>While some legislators and others in the Government vilify Japan over economic issues, one tiny Federal agency struggles on to bring the two countries closer together.</p><p>The Japan-United States Friendship Commission may seem like an oddity, given the often fractious state of the relationship between the two countries. But since 1976, under its legislative mandate, it has been trying to ''enhance people to people reciprocal understanding.''</p><p>The agency operates much like a private foundation, spending about $4 million a year on a variety of projects, including Japanese language studies, cultural exchanges and research into the policy and economic issues dividing the two countries.</p><p>With a four-person work force, including three in Washington and one in Tokyo, the commission is one of the smallest independent Federal agencies and the only one established to deal exclusively with one other country, said Lindley S. Sloan, the commission's executive director.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Sloan, a specialist on Asia who has been a foundation administrator and a Congressional foreign policy staffer, said the commission tries, despite its diminutive size, to direct its funds to achieve a ''critical mass of understanding.'' Need to Understand Each Other</p><p>A former director of the agency, Richard A. Ericson Jr., described the commission as ''a little rock sticking up in the current of the relationship'' between Japan and the United States.''</p><p>The commission was founded at the initiative of the late Senator Jacob K. Javits, the liberal Republican from New York, on the premise that although relations between Japan and the United States were important, most Americans and Japanese knew little of each other's values, history, culture and language.</p><p>''When you had two countries with such vastly different cultures and approaches to life, you really needed to create experts and public understanding on both sides,'' Mr. Sloan said, ''so that when you have difficulties there would be people with knowledge to work it out.''</p><p>When the commission was founded it was also regarded as a significant gesture to the Japanese that recognized the importance attached by United States to its relationship with Japan, Mr. Ericson said.</p><p>The commission's activities are supervised by an 18-member panel whose members include two members of House, two Senators, and the chairmen of the National Endowment for the Arts and of the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>The other 12 commissioners are appointed to three-year terms from academia and business. Among them are Chalmers Johnson, a leading expert on Japan who is on the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, and Frank B. Gibney, an author and television producer who specializes in Japanese affairs.</p><p>Events such as last week's visit to the United States by Japan's Prime Minister, Noboru Takeshita, underscore what Mr. Sloan referred to as a ''dichotomy'' he discerns in American attitudes toward Japan.</p><p>While powerful Government officials at the national level in Washington express ire over Japanese trade practices on products ranging from cattle to construction contracts, Mr. Lindley has detected a different, more positive attitude welling up outside the nation's capital. Rise in Number of Grants</p><p>''I feel like the shells are going over my desk,'' said Mr. Sloan, referring to the sometimes incendiary language emanating from Washington. ''At the same time, people out there in the country are constantly asking me how to get into the Japan business.''</p><p>Mr. Sloan said the grass-roots upsurge in American interest in Japan in recent years is reflected in a variety of ways, including in the number of grants made by the commission, which have increased from 18 in 1977 to 145 last year.</p><p>In addition, Japan-America societies, formed to study culture, language and economic relations, have sprung up in areas not historically associated with an interest in Japan, like Tampa, Fla; Austin, Texas; Pittsburgh and Burlington, Vt.</p><p>An increasing number of localities are also seeking to link themselves as sister cities with communities in Japan, while American universities are increasingly seeking help from the commission in developing Japanese study programs.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Sloan said there was a brisk trans-Pacific traffic of state and local officials traveling to Japan seeking investment in their jurisdictions. ''State officials are really thirsty for investment,'' Mr. Sloan said.  A Need for Caution The commission has ridden the wave of curiosity about Japan cautiously, navigating between two countries whose testy relationship could easily make the agency a target for members of Congress who each year approve the its budget.</p><p>In 1985, Congress cut deep into the commission's budget. Although part of the funds were later restored, the experience, along with the growing urgency of problems between the two countries, prompted the commission to begin emphasizing research grants and public affairs programs related to contemporary public policy issues and economic problems.</p><p>Researchers financed by the commission are now studying such subjects as the impact of Japanese investment on selected American communities. Other researchers are reviewing the Japanese health insurance system and Japan's nuclear power industry to determine whether there are practices applicable to the United States. Largest Single Project</p><p>Some of the commission's larger grants support graduate business schools seeking to include the study of American-Japanese economic issues and in some instances Japanese language studies in their curriculums.</p><p>The largest single project financed by the agency is the Inter-University Center for Japanese language studies in Tokyo. Under the program, several dozen Americans study Japanese for a year on a total immersion basis.</p><p>The commission draws on two main sources of income for its budget. One fund is made up of payments from Japan to reimburse the United States for postwar economic assistance. The second is from Japanese payments to the United States for American facilities built on the Ryukyus Islands, which were returned to the Japanese in 1971.</p><p>The commission is also authorized to receive gifts. Since 1981, the Japanese Government has contributed $5 million, which has been used to support the Japan-America societies throughout the United States.</p><p>A portion of the commission funds remain in Japan in the form of yen, which because of the declining value of the dollar against the yen, has grown from $18 million when the agency was founded, to about $29 million. Money Spent in Japan</p><p>However, Mr. Sloan said that the commission has not profited from the recent strength of yen against the dollar because the yen funds, which by law are not convertible, are spent entirely in Japan on the agency's programs there.</p><p>''We have two very large countries, but this little commission does a great deal of good that is not very well known,'' Mr. Ericson said. ''If we're going to understand each other, you've got to study it, exchange ideas, you've got to get some idea of what they're about and what we're dealing with.''</p><p>Photo of Lindley S.
