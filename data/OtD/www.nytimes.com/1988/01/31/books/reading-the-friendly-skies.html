                    <p>A HISTORY OF WESTERN ASTROLOGY  By S. J. Tester. Illustrated. 256 pp. Wolfeboro, N.H.: Boydell &amp; Brewer. $36.</p><p>For almost 2,000 years, from the 3rd century B. C. to the 17th A. D., the skies spoke to learned men. The language they used was complex. Its lexicon was provided by the seven known planets, from the moon to Saturn. Each planet had its properties of dryness or wetness, benevolence or cruelty, as its physical appearance and the attributes of the god associated with it suggested: Mars, for example, was hot, dry and choleric. The grammar and syntax of the heavens' language - in other words, the interrelations between the planets and the meanings of their movements - were supplied by astronomy and geometry. The 360 degrees, 12 signs and varied constellations of the zodiac modified the effects of each planet in different ways. So, even more importantly, did the angles at which the planets regarded one another. The astrologer used precise tables to construct the sentence that the sky uttered at any given time; he then used a rich qualitative theory to interpret it.</p><p>The messages that resulted were as diverse as the rules that created them were elaborate. They might predict the life and fate of an individual, a city or a state; they might simply define auspicious times to start a building, pick a medicinal plant or invest money. In all periods astrologers found attentive listeners and generous patrons. And though their predictions often proved wrong, they and the art they practiced rarely suffered any loss of profit or esteem. Like modern economists, premodern astrologers deftly uncovered ex post facto the hidden factors and unknown data that supposedly accounted for their mistakes; like the economists, they had their reward in still larger fees for the next forecast.</p><p>S. J. Tester's ''History of Western Astrology'' surveys astrology from its origins to around 1700, more text by text than issue by issue. The author, who died in 1986, knew the primary sources - especially the classical ones - and had read many modern studies of his subject. His lucid, well-informed and concise book tells a coherent story that until now had to be pieced together from primary and secondary sources of diverse age, aim and value.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In doing this, his book fills a large and rather surprising gap. As it makes clear, most readers - and, in fact, most scholars - have a far feebler grasp of astrology than of any other discipline so central to Western culture. Admirers of astrology think it was created thousands and thousands of years ago by Egyptian and Babylonian sages. Critics of astrology may disagree about its age but usually agree about its Eastern place of origin. They consider it an alien excrescence on Greek culture, at once a sign and a cause of the tragic retreat from rationalism that took place after the time of Thucydides and Socrates. Tester, who had taught classics at Bristol University, uses the classic work of Otto Neugebauer and other modern scholars in exposing both views as false. Astrology was Hellenistic, not archaic, in origin and as Greek as wine with goat cheese sprinkled on it.</p><p>Indeed, as Tester shows, astrology came into being at the same time as Greek planetary theory - with which it shared the premise that what happens on Earth is messy, unpredictable and inferior, while what happens in the heavens is regular, precisely predictable and therefore superior. Hipparchus, the first great Greek astronomer, apparently worked on both in the second century B.C. Ptolemy, perhaps the greatest ancient scientist, wrote the standard handbook for astrology, the ''Tetrabiblos,'' as well as that for mathematical astronomy, the ''Almagest.'' And astrology survived the skepticism of some pagan Greek philosophers and the antipathy of the Fathers of the Christian church to become a fundamental part of high medieval and Renaissance culture.</p><p>Copernicus and Kepler destroyed the geocentric world picture on which astrology rested; yet neither attacked astrology, and Kepler even tried to amend it to match his new cosmology. And in most European and Islamic courts and institutions of learning the astrologer enjoyed enormous influence. Frederick II would not sleep with his wife, or Lorenzo de' Medici build his country house, until their astrologers had set the days and times for doing so. The ceilings of churches and the walls of palaces bloomed during the Renaissance with splendid pictures of the skies. Apparently carefree mythological fantasies by the likes of Pontormo and Raphael were in fact the painted horoscopes of the patrons who commissioned them. Throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, every university medical school offered regular courses in medical astrology, the science that explained how every part of the body, prescribed medicine and time of treatment was controlled or influenced by the stars. Astrology offered a method of interpreting history. Ancient scholars used astrology to date and explain the foundation of Rome, later ones to account for the flood and the rise of Islam. But it also seemed to contradict the Christian view of providence, and brought its followers into peril when they claimed that it could explain the birth and powers of Christ as well. Astrology allayed fears in a premodern world where fire, disease, bandits outside the walls and disloyal servants within them always threatened social position, wealth and life itself. But it also created fears, as when the astrologers' prediction that a deluge would follow a conjunction of all the planets in the watery sign of Pisces terrified thousands throughout Europe in February 1524.</p><p>The causes for the downfall of astrology remain peculiarly obscure. In 1650, it still claimed the serious interest of many scientists and scholars. By 1700, it had clearly fallen from the world of learning to the submerged and popular milieus where it still flourishes in a diluted form, the object of close attention in countless almanacs, newspapers and supermarket books. Yet scholars have given few compelling reasons for the decline in astrology's status.</p><p>Tester doesn't explain the downfall either, but he dispels one of the major prejudices against astrology -the notion that it was ''irrational.'' On the contrary, he shows that it was the first comprehensive and universal science the West ever knew, and highly logical to boot. It subjected the imperfect and transitory world beneath the sphere of the moon to the perfect and immutable world of stars and planets. It ordered the messy and qualitative laws of biology and physics in terms of the neat and predictable motions of the heavens. And it could accommodate and explain more facts than any rival system. The astrologer could make sense of everything from the character of an individual to the sexual habits of a nation.</p><p>Tester, in sum, accepts and amplifies Neugebauer's verdict that, compared to pagan medicine or Christian theology, ''the fundamental doctrines of astrology are pure science.'' He calls the effort to stigmatize astrology as un-Greek and irrational a form of academic McCarthyism - an effort to purge or control whatever cannot be accepted as positive and virtuous.</p><p>The work of a man who was losing a battle with cancer as he wrote, ''A History of Western Astrology'' stimulates thought and commands respect. And its errors of fact and judgment - rare in the classical sections, more frequent in the later ones - will be forgiven by the many readers who will use it with profit. Used with J. C. Eade's more technical book ''The Forgotten Sky'' (1984) and the older, classic work of Auguste Bouche-Leclercq, published in 1899, it makes a good beginner's manual of conversation for those who want to listen in to that cosmic party line through which the skies spoke to our ancestors.</p><p>Drawings of zodiac sign Capricorn, from a 1482 book; magician's poster for the 1840's showing the zodiac; a 17th-century French engraving of an astrologer; detail of a 1970 poster, ''The Galaxian Manifestation''; zodiac signs on a palmistry chart; an Egyptian Sagittarius</p>                </div>
