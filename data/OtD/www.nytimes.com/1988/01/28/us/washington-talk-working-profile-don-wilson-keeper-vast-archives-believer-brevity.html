He had earned straight A's in his undergraduate studies and had filled two blue books answering the questions in the examination.</p><p>''You can write all day and not say anything,'' his professor told him. ''On your next exam, I want you to think for 10 minutes, write an outline, and then write a one-paragraph introduction, one paragraph thesis, three supporting paragraphs, and a one-paragraph conclusion.''</p><p>''I don't want to read anything more than six paragraphs,'' the professor concluded. Empire of 3.5 Billion Documents</p><p>Mr. Wilson said he hoped such brevity and focus would become the hallmark of his tenure as the seventh Archivist of the United States, the keeper of the nation's memory.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The 45-year-old historian took office last month as overseer of 3.5 billion Goverment documents dating to before the American Revolution, including eight Presidential libraries and 14 Federal record centers. All executive, judicial and Congressional documents are part of his domain.</p><p>The National Archives became an independent agency in 1985 as a result of a controversy surrounding the release of Richard M. Nixon's Watergate tapes. The agency was previously part of the General Services Administration, a political entity.</p><p>In the years since receiving his Ph.D in American history, Mr. Wilson has worked with Gerald R. Ford and Alf M. Landon, the late Kansas Governor and Presidential candidate, written papers on pioneer Jews and Western editors, solicited memorabilia and written historical roadside markers. He said his new job was all a historian turned archivist could hope to expect.</p><p>''Anything of significant value more than 30 years old is supposed to come to the National Archives,'' Mr. Wilson said. Opposition to Earlier Nominee</p><p>This includes White House records, agency documents, treaties, diplomatic materials, Supreme Court decisions and Congressional bills and committee documents. Then there are pension files, military records from the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, captured German and Japanese military documents, and even records of World War II concentration camps.</p><p>Mr. Wilson was President Reagan's second choice for the $82,500-a-year post. Mr. Reagan at first nominated John T. Agresto, deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, a protege of Education Secretary William J. Bennett.</p><p>Mr. Agresto was opposed by 16 major scholarly organizations as not qualified for the post, amid fears that he would use the position to espouse a conservative ideology. The Senate failed to act on the nomination.</p><p>By contrast, Mr. Wilson's appointment was seen as nonpolitical, and was hailed by both academics and Capitol Hill.</p><p>''Don Wilson is a very highly respected member of the archivist community,'' said Leonard Weiss, staff director of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</p><p>Not that Mr. Wilson, a native Kansan, lacked political clout. His nomination was supported by the two Senators from Kansas, Bob Dole and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, both Republicans. Lunch Is Landon's Treat</p><p>Mr. Wilson met Mrs. Kassebaum in a previous post as archivist of the Kansas State Historical Society, in his dealings with her father, Alf Landon, who carried the Republican Presidential torch in the 1936 campaign swept by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p><p>The society kept Mr. Landon's political memorabilia, and the former Kansas Governor imposed one condition on researchers who sought access to his papers. ''Any researcher who wanted to see his papers needed his personal O.K.,'' Mr. Wilson recalled. ''This meant a telephone call to Mr. Landon, who took the researcher out to lunch and always gave his approval.''</p><p>Mr. Wilson later served as deputy director of the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kan., associate director of the Wisconsin historical society and the first director of the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum. In that capacity he worked with the former President, arranging conferences as well as building the archives.</p><p>He recalled Mr. Ford as ''very businesslike,'' and possessed of ''a good sense of humor.''</p><p>''I've never dealt with anyone who could get more done in a shorter amount of time,'' Mr. Wilson said of Mr. Ford. ''He was committed to making the library and museum a national institution. His attitude was, 'You're the professional, you know what I want.' '' Ambition to Be a Lawyer</p><p>He said he left the Ford library to come to Washington because it was ''a professional commitment'' that he and his wife, Patsy, felt he had to make. ''There's probably no other job in the country I would have moved for,'' he said.</p><p>Mr. Wilson did not intend to become an archivist. His first ambition was to become a lawyer. But after graduation from Washburn University in Topeka, he received a fellowship to study American history at the University of Cincinnati.</p><p>An early work, ''Pioneer Jews of California and Arizona,'' was an accident of geographic propinquity, the result of the proximity of the University of Cincinnati and Hebrew Union College, which was across the street.</p><p>Mr. Wilson discovered that the Jews went to California as part of the Gold Rush, but then backtracked. ''The Jewish pioneers went from west to east,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''They went to San Francisco, and then doubled back to Utah and Arizona.''</p><p>Mr. Wilson is also the author of ''Barbed Words on the Frontier: Early Kansas editors.'' From 1860 to 1915, he said, ''Kansas had more newspapers per capita than any state in the union. There were no libel laws, and these editors would crucify one another.'' Goal of New Archivist</p><p>Mr. Wilson wants to increase the nation's awareness of its historical heritage. ''I hope to raise the visibility of the archives,'' he said. ''I hope to make the American people more aware of the archives' role as keeper and publicizer of our nation's heritage.''</p><p>He also hopes to put some zest into the National Archives, a task for which he feels trained by his job with the Kansas Historical Society. One of his tasks, he recalled, was writing brief historical roadmarkers.</p><p>''Did you ever try to write a history of Lieut. John Pike's exploration of the trans-Mississippi West in 150 words?'' he asked. ''I tried again and again, but my boss, an old journalist, kept saying, 'nice try, but no zip.'''</p><p>''That's what I'm trying to do with the National Archives: put a little zip into it,'' he added.</p><p>Photo of Don Wilson (NYT/Michael Geissinger)</p>                </div>
