                    <p>First the Internal Revenue Service was ordered to withhold tax refunds from people who defaulted on federally guaranteed student loans. Then the Education Department got stern with the banks, ordering them to demonstrate ''due diligence'' in seeking repayment of student loans. Next, Congress passed a law allowing the Government to sell defaulted loans to collection agencies.</p><p>Still, the student defaults continue to rise, costing the Federal Government billions of dollars.</p><p>Some defaulters are hard-core cheaters. Some are young people who cannot come up with the cash to pay. Some simply do not take the loan contract seriously. But from the start of the loan program in 1965, thousands have taken out low-interest, Government-insured loans to help meet tuition costs for college or professional schools and, when they left school, they did not pay back the money.</p><p>As a result, default payments have grown to become the third-highest expenditure in the Education Department. This fiscal year the Government will spend $3.4 billion on its Guaranteed Student Loan program, renamed the Robert T. Stafford Loans last month after the retiring Senator from Vermont, who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Education Subcommittee. Nearly half that, $1.6 billion, will go to cover defaulted loans, Federal officials estimate. In 1990, defaults are expected to cost the Government $2 billion.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This drain in a time of huge budget deficits has prompted many members of Congress to push the default problem near the top of their legislative agenda.</p><p>''It has certainly become a hot item here,'' said Michael Lance, a legislative associate on the House Subcommittee on Post-Secondary Education. ''I think if we don't do something, it's going to be symbolically very unfortunate. It will indicate a Congressional complacency, which doesn't exist. Or it will indicate a Congressional deadlock - that we don't know what to do.'' A Sensitive Issue</p><p>Getting tough on defaults is a sensitive matter because the loans represent the Government's mission of promoting equality and prosperity for its citizens by providing access to education. With college costs climbing more than 80 percent since 1980 and the Reagan Administration making deep cuts in Federal grant programs for students, the loans have become important both to middle-income families that are unable to meet rising tuition costs and to low-income families who often find grants unavailable.</p><p>The issue intensified last November when Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, declaring that student loan defaults were out of control, proposed withholding all Federal student aid funds from any institution that did not bring its default rate below 20 percent by 1990.</p><p>Mr. Bennett's proposal drew sharp criticism from educators and legislators. They called the measure draconian and pronounced it unfair because most of the schools with high default rates have student bodies largely made up of poor and minority students.</p><p>At least five bills aimed at reducing defaults have been introduced in Congress since Mr. Bennett made his proposal, in part as alternatives to his stringent plan. Now Pat Williams, the Montana Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Post-Secondary Education, and Claiborne Pell, the Democrat from Rhode Island who heads the Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts and Humanities, are moving to draft bills that they hope will lead to passage of legislation on defaults before Congress adjourns in October.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Education Department is moving to carry out Mr. Bennett's recommendation. It has drafted a ''notice of proposed rule making'' that department officials say will go to the Federal Registry in June. Department Proposes Plan</p><p>The Education Department also submitted a series of legislative proposals to Congress on May 5, including these:</p><p>* Requiring lenders to conduct credit checks on all applicants for federally guaranteed student loans who are 21 years old or older. Anyone with a poor credit history would have to get a co-signer to receive a loan.</p><p>* Reducing Federal insurance on the loans from 100 percent to from 70 percent to 90 percent, depending on the default rate of the loan guarantee agency. The guaranteed student loan program is now the only Federal lending program with 100 percent insurance.</p><p>* Requiring the borrower to have a high school diploma or the equivalent.</p><p>The Reagan Administration also believes that shutting off student aid funds to fly-by-night trade schools and other institutions that enroll ill-prepared students and then keep Federal aid money when they drop out will go a long way toward solving the problem.</p><p>While schools legally have no role in the repayment process, both Republicans and Democrats say the schools must bear more responsibility for making sure students pay back their loans.</p><p>Although he feels that Mr. Bennett's approach is too radical, Mr. Pell, who has been a staunch supporter of student aid programs, said his suggestions were not opposite to those of the Administration.</p><p>''We're working on various ideas,'' Mr. Pell said. ''My own view is that if there's a 25 percent default rate, we really have to clamp down hard on those institutions. Any guarantee agency, school or lender with a default rate above 25 percent would have to develop its own default management plan.''</p><p>But as for barring institutions with high default rates from participating in all Federal student aid programs, Mr. Pell said, ''I would seek to avoid it.''</p><p>A number of lawmakers, like Mr. Pell, contend that part of the problem is that the loan program has veered off its original course. They say the Government is offering loans to people of very low income levels, who should be receiving grants. Decline in Federal Grants</p><p>''Ten years ago, the rate of grants to loans was about 3 to 1; now it's just the opposite,'' Mr. Pell said. ''And that means some of these young people will be graduating from college as what I call an indentured class of person, who will have to make their job decisions according to to how much money they can make, not what their interests are.''</p><p>Mr. Williams is trying to determine whether there is enough support among members of the House Education and Labor Committee to change the Government's principal student grant program, the Pell Grants, either by increasing the maximum grant awarded or altering eligiblity rules to bring more students into the program.</p><p>Photos of Sen.
