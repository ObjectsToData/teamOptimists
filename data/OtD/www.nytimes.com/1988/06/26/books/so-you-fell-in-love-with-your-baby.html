SACRED BOND  The Legacy of Baby M.  By Phyllis Chesler. 212 pp. New York: Times Books. $16.95.</p><p>ON Nov. 24, 1979, an anonymous couple began running an extraordinary appeal through the classified advertisement section of The Louisville Courier-Journal. A Kentucky husband and wife, already the adoptive parents of one child, were seeking a woman willing, in a sense, to become part of a complex modern triangle. She would be evaluated by a gynecologist and obstetrician, by a psychiatrist or two, and if found acceptable by them - fertile in body, sound of mind - become the repeated recipient of the husband's sperm (the wife being unable to bear children) until a pregnancy resulted. Eventually, upon delivery of a child, she would be paid a sum of money and deliver the baby to the couple.</p><p>More than a week later Elizabeth Kane, the pseudonymous author of ''Birth Mother,'' an Illinois mother of three in her middle 30's, a part-time cosmetics saleswoman happily married to an insurance executive, read an account of the couple's newspaper inquiry in her local paper, The Peoria Journal Star. Almost immediately she began thinking of herself as a candidate for the insemination. Within hours she was convinced not only that she would respond to the couple's advertisement, but become an extremely important part of their life: ''Suddenly a feeling swept over me -a knowledge that I would have a child for this man and woman in Kentucky.''</p><p>By January 1980 Ms. Kane was in contact with a lawyer and a doctor, both from Louisville. Would she want to become ''the surrogate mother for the couple mentioned in the article''? Soon enough her prophecy would be proved correct. She went to Louisville, was evaluated, chosen, inseminated and in early November of that same year gave birth to a boy who is now the son of the couple whose public search had begun a year earlier. ''Birth Mother'' is written in diary form - an account of what happened to ''America's first legal surrogate mother,'' as the book's subtitle calls her, as well as her husband and her other children, as they became centrally involved in an increasingly controversial medical and ethical matter that brought them substantial notoriety.</p>                </div>

                    <p>THE author is frank to acknowledge that for years she had harbored a wish to help one or another infertile couple as a surrogate. She asked this of herself early on, before she was chosen by the Louisville doctors and lawyer: ''How could I convince Kent, my conservative, insurance executive husband, that I must be allowed to have a child for a couple I would never meet? Why did it mean so much to me? I seemed to be filled with almost an insatiable hunger for this pregnancy.'' She refers, further on, to her ''obsession,'' one which would be of no small consequence not only to her, but to her husband, her 10- and 12-year-old daughters and her 4-year-old son -as much of the book makes clear in great detail.</p><p>In time she became a celebrity of sorts: appearances on various television programs, her picture and her story in national magazines. Meanwhile, her husband lost his job, many objected to surrogate motherhood on moral and religious grounds and judged her to be an adulteress. Her children became confused, anxious, frightened and, worst of all, felt abandoned by her as she traveled to distant cities in order to meet talk-show hosts or to Louisville, where she was, of course, seen by the doctor who would deliver her and by the couple who now are the parents of the boy whom she, his birth mother, essentially gave to them, in return for a little more than $10,000.</p><p>YET, she never really does tell us - maybe she hasn't told herself - why, indeed, she wanted so much to be a surrogate mother.</p><p>Money was certainly not her motive. Nor does she seem to have been troubled, lonely or embittered before she read her Peoria Journal Star in late 1979. She does mention that before she was married she had a child out of wedlock and gave her up for adoption. She also makes clear that she enjoyed no great closeness with her parents; they hardly figure in her journal - other than as reproving figures whom she dreaded telling of her surrogate pregnancy. She and her husband, to be sure, had their occasional marital difficulties, but this is not a story of a broken marriage somehow prompting a desperate flight of fancy, then deed. ''I want to do this for the childless couples of the world,'' the author quotes herself as having told her husband at one early point in their joint consideration of what lay ahead, and it is this mix of grandiosity and naivete that informs much of the book's writing, often instructively and impressively modified by an almost Augustinian kind of confessional self-scrutiny - as when, for instance, the author refers to her ''selfishness and stubbornness.''</p><p>In fact, Ms. Kane comes across in this earnest story as, on the whole, a decent, conscientious person who got swept into a whirl of exciting, exhausting publicity, and who eventually realized how hard it would be to say goodbye to a child she once thought of as a gift to others. She also tries hard to be respectful of the doctor and lawyer with whom she had to work, not to mention a hometown minister to whom she confided her doubts and worries. All three of them, however, disappointed her and, she ultimately realized, manipulated her for their own purposes. The book is devastating in that regard: portraits of a self-centered, arrogant, callous physician, eager as can be to show himself off, pose for cameras, rake in cash while he became known nationally as someone who arranges surrogate pregnancies; a lawyer all too pushy and demanding; and, worst of all, a minister who not only was eager to be photographed, to appear on television - nothing special these days - but was willing to betray confidences, curry favor with reporters, strut and pose endlessly at the expense of a vulnerable woman who had turned to him for advice, if not consolation.</p>                </div>
