    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  International A3-7  FRANCE ISOLATED ON BOSNIA  France's effort to get its allies to join in using military force to stop Serbian attacks on Muslim enclaves in Bosnia is being undermined by British reluctance to go to war and American hesitancy in the face of European division. A1  American military officials see a risk of war with the Serbs. A7  Muslims missing after Srebrenica's fall made their way to safety.  A7  LESSONS FROM JAPAN'S SCHOOLS  As Americans dissatisfied with their own educational system look at alternatives, Japanese schools stand out for their discipline, safety and training in the basics. A1  GINGRICH TAKES ON THE WORLD  The Speaker of the House who captivated much of Congress and the country with his domestic politics is having trouble making sense of foreign policy issues he did not have to consider before. A1  END OF AMERICAN TV MAKERS  Zenith Electronics, the last American-owned television manufacturer, has given up its battle to survive on its own, agreeing to sell a controlling interest to a South Korean industrial giant.  A1  FRIENDLY PERSUASION  Representative Bill Richardson, the New Mexico Democrat who helped free two Americans held in Iraq, has become an unofficial emissary working to extricate fellow citizens from trouble.  A3  OPENING CUBA TO U.S. MEDIA  The Clinton Administration plans to drop the longstanding ban on American news organizations establishing bureaus in Cuba. A6  Mugunga Journal: Refugee camp in Zaire is a Rwandan transplant. A4  National A8-10, D23  JACKSON'S ROLE IN '96  Jesse Jackson, who says that he has registered millions of Democratic voters, more than anyone else, has emerged as the President's most nettlesome election problem.  A1  SMITH CONFESSION REVEALED  A county sheriff in South Carolina testified at the murder trial of Susan Smith how with the help of a small lie he got her to confess to the killing of her two sons.  A1  SUBWAY WRECK IN BOSTON  A Boston subway car rammed into another that was stopped at a platform, injuring 32 people and halting service on one subway line through the evening rush.  A8  SIMPSON FITNESS TAPE VIEWED  Prosecutors played portions of an exercise video O.J. Simpson made two weeks before Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed, seeking to show that he was physically capable of killing.  A8  INQUIRY ON AGENTS' PICNIC  Expressing outrage at the possibility that Federal firearms agents may have attended a picnic with blatant racist and anti-Semitic themes, the Treasury Secretary ordered an investigation.  A10  DRUGS CALLED TOP THREAT  A survey said American adolescents see drugs as the greatest problem they face -- far outranking their concern about crime, social pressure, grades or sex.  A8  VENUE CHANGE SOUGHT IN BOMBING  Timothy McVeigh, one of two suspects arrested in the Oklahoma City bombing, should not be tried in Oklahoma, his lawyer said.  A8  HEAT TOLL RISES  Chicago's official death toll from the recent heat wave increased, but hundreds of bodies were yet to be examined.  A10  FLOOR FIGHT ON ARTS MONEY  House Republicans opened the final floor fight over Government aid to the arts and humanities.  D23  Capitol Sketchbook: Democrats rallied in the arts fight.  D23  DELAY ON REGULATION CURBS  Senate Democrats, struggling to preserve Federal regulatory powers, turned aside a Republican effort to cut off debate and force a vote on the issue.

A1  American military officials see a risk of war with the Serbs. A7  Muslims missing after Srebrenica's fall made their way to safety.  A7  LESSONS FROM JAPAN'S SCHOOLS  As Americans dissatisfied with their own educational system look at alternatives, Japanese schools stand out for their discipline, safety and training in the basics. A1  GINGRICH TAKES ON THE WORLD  The Speaker of the House who captivated much of Congress and the country with his domestic politics is having trouble making sense of foreign policy issues he did not have to consider before. A1  END OF AMERICAN TV MAKERS  Zenith Electronics, the last American-owned television manufacturer, has given up its battle to survive on its own, agreeing to sell a controlling interest to a South Korean industrial giant.  A1  FRIENDLY PERSUASION  Representative Bill Richardson, the New Mexico Democrat who helped free two Americans held in Iraq, has become an unofficial emissary working to extricate fellow citizens from trouble.

A1  SUBWAY WRECK IN BOSTON  A Boston subway car rammed into another that was stopped at a platform, injuring 32 people and halting service on one subway line through the evening rush.  A8  SIMPSON FITNESS TAPE VIEWED  Prosecutors played portions of an exercise video O.J. Simpson made two weeks before Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed, seeking to show that he was physically capable of killing.  A8  INQUIRY ON AGENTS' PICNIC  Expressing outrage at the possibility that Federal firearms agents may have attended a picnic with blatant racist and anti-Semitic themes, the Treasury Secretary ordered an investigation.  A10  DRUGS CALLED TOP THREAT  A survey said American adolescents see drugs as the greatest problem they face -- far outranking their concern about crime, social pressure, grades or sex.  A8  VENUE CHANGE SOUGHT IN BOMBING  Timothy McVeigh, one of two suspects arrested in the Oklahoma City bombing, should not be tried in Oklahoma, his lawyer said.  A8  HEAT TOLL RISES  Chicago's official death toll from the recent heat wave increased, but hundreds of bodies were yet to be examined.
