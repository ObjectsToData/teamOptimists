                    <p>The Senate plan included the same bottom line in budget authority as the House, $489.161 billion, but differed significantly on how to spend that sum.</p><p>Mr. Hatfield would allocate $1.6 billion more for labor, health and human services and education programs than the $61 billion that the House allowed. He would give $1.6 billion more to water and energy development, a traditional haven for legislators' pet projects or pork barrel spending, than the House's figure of $18.7 billion</p><p>Mr. Hatfield also cut deeper into spending for a half-dozen departments, including Defense, $1.4 billion; Commerce, $1.3 billion, and Transportation, $200 million, than the House.</p><p>Even as the House Appropriations Committee moved to rein in some environmental laws that big business has complained about most, the Senate balked at passing regulatory changes that big business has also championed, causing the majority leader, Bob Dole, to pull the bill off the floor.</p><p>The House committee, voting along party lines, approved a $61.7 billion allocation for veterans, housing, environmental and other programs for 1996, but included language that would withhold money for enforcement of statutes like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts until Congress had decided on reauthorizing them.</p><p>As the Appropriations Committee worked, the full House ended its debate and voted on an $11.96 billion allocation for the Interior Department. That bill, which passed 244 to 181, includes legislation that would reduce Federal financing next year by 40 percent for the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities and would halt all financing to the arts agency in two years.</p><p>That vote was followed immediately by the opening of a floor debate on the appropriations for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service and other agencies. That $23.2 billion measure is $322.7 million less than in 1995 and $1.8 billion less than the Administration had requested. There are $41 million in cuts from the Executive Office, including all money for a major advisory group, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the bill prohibits Federal employee health-insurance plans from covering abortions, except when a mother's life is at risk.</p><p>Before the House quits for the week on Friday, it is also scheduled to debate three other appropriations bills, for the Agriculture Department, for the Transportation Departments and for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments, as well as for the judiciary.</p><p>The bill on veterans, housing and environmental programs, which the committee approved today in a party-line vote, was one of the sparest appropriations bills to gain favor.</p><p>Although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget sailed through virtually unscathed at $13.67 billion, $705 million less than its budget request, the bill overall cut discretionary spending by $8.3 billion from the 1995 allocation.</p><p>The major cuts are from the Environmental Protection Agency, which would receive $4.88 billion, 33 percent or $2.4 billion less than its current budget, and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which was allocated $19.1 billion, a 23 percent or $5.5 billion reduction.</p><p>"It is certainly the case that many of the agencies in this bill are unhappy," said Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California and chairman of the Subcommittee on the Veterans Affairs Department, Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies. "But the House Appropriations Committee is clearly prepared to draw a line on spending."</p><p>The bill would close four agencies, for savings of $723 million, the subcommittee's part of the National Service Program, known as Americorp; the Community Development Financial Institutions, the Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board and the Council on Environmental Quality.</p><p>The bill also has 17 riders or side language about the E.P.A., which Democrats complained went beyond the Appropriations Committee's traditional powers and intruded into realms usually reserved for authorizing committees.</p><p>The bill would allocate $1.5 billion for the water programs, but it has a rider that none of the money would be available unless Congress reauthorizes the Clean Water Act.</p><p>Another rider would exempt states from having to start centralized vehicle-emissions tests.</p><p>"The effect of this bill is that people in communities across this country will suffer," the E.P.A. administrator, Carol Browner, said in a telephone interview. "My ability to make sure that the quality of air that people breath and the water that they drink is good will be in question."</p>                </div>
