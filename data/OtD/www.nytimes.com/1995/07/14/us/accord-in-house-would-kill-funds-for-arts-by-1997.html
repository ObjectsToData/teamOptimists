The House, mired in a daylong debate over a bill appropriating $11.96 billion for the Interior Department for 1996, did not reach a similar agreement to shorten the life of the National Endowment for the Humanities. But two amendments wending through the House and toward likely approval would set in law the 1997 deadline for both the arts and humanities agencies.">

                    <p>Faced with a freshman-led mutiny, House Republican leaders agreed today to cut off all Federal funding to the National Endowment for the Arts within two years -- a year earlier than they had planned and five years ahead of the Senate's schedule.</p><p>The House, mired in a daylong debate over a bill appropriating $11.96 billion for the Interior Department for 1996, did not reach a similar agreement to shorten the life of the National Endowment for the Humanities. But two amendments wending through the House and toward likely approval would set in law the 1997 deadline for both the arts and humanities agencies.</p><p>Another of the conservatives' favorite cultural targets, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is also in line for a phaseout of Government financing. An Appropriations subcommittee has approved a $240 million subsidy for 1996, a reduction of $20 million, or 7.7 percent, from 1995. While the cutback is far smaller than had originally been threatened, the subcommittee has put the corporation, too, on the road toward an end of all Federal financing. A proposal to that effect could come before the full House as early as next week.</p><p>The future of the endowments has become the focal point of the debate over the Interior Department's appropriations bill.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The bill would cut financing for the endowments by 40 percent over their current budgets -- leaving arts and humanities each with $99.5 million for 1996, while heading them toward an end to all Federal financing.</p><p>The bill would also immediately eliminate financing for President Clinton's national service program, Americorps, and for new land purchases. And it would terminate the agency that helps compile the endangered species list, the National Biological Service, transferring its duties to the United States Geological Survey; begin the phase-out of the Bureau of Mines, and provide only nominal financing, $1, for a proposed new Federal park in the Mojave National Preserve. Current language in the bill extends a 14-year-old moratorium on any new offshore oil and gas drilling and exploration but removes a ban on new mining patents.</p><p>Supporters of some of the programs targeted in the bill are depending on the more moderate Senate to mitigate the cuts, as it did with the package of midyear budget reductions. But early in the House debate today, Republican floor leaders insisted that they would hold fast to their timetable on the endowments in conference with the Senate.</p><p>The battle over the arts and humanities programs opened with a curious skirmish.</p><p>Before debate can begin on a bill, lawmakers must first approve the rules or guidelines under which the debate will proceed. With 232 Republicans in the 435-seat House, Republican leaders had expected to push through the Interior bill over Democratic opposition, by adopting a rule that would have limited both debate and the opportunity for amendments to restore money for the endowments and other programs.</p><p>But that plan fell apart late Wednesday night when dozens of Republicans, most of them freshmen, joined Democrats to reject that rule, 238 to 177. While Democrats wanted the chance to put money in, conservatives were angry that the rule would also have denied them the chance to kill Federal funding immediately for the arts and humanities.</p><p>Bowing to those angry rumblings from the Republican freshmen, the House leadership this morning put forward a new rule, which was approved by a 229-to-195 vote, that not only opened the floodgates for dozens of amendments but also included language that would end the arts endowment funding in two years unless Congress later authorizes new spending.</p><p>The original House legislation had specified three more years of funding, and the Senate has indicated it would settle on seven years. After losing on the first rule, House Republican leaders suggested as a compromise phasing out the endowment subsidy over five years.</p><p>That idea was met this morning with swift and angry rejection from conservative and mostly junior Republicans.</p><p>"That doesn't demonstrate that we're moving toward the fiscal discipline many of us came here to accomplish," said Representative John Shadegg of Arizona, a freshman Republican.</p><p>Just about half of the appropriation -- $6 billion -- would go toward financing the Interior Department programs that manage and study the country's animal, plant and mineral resources. The rest of the money is allocated among programs dealing with culture, art, agriculture, energy and Indian affairs, all of which have traditionally been lumped together for budget purposes.</p><p>The total appropriation is $1.56 billion less than in 1995 and $1.85 billion less than the Clinton Administration requested. A majority of the cuts come from budgets for the arts and culture -- $72.6 million from the humanities endowment; $62.9 million from the arts endowment; $12 million from the Smithsonian Institution, which will receive $350 million; $7.7 million from the Institute of Museum Services, which would leave it with $21 million; $6.9 million from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which would receive $6.2 million.</p><p>Only the National Holocaust Museum, where the attendance is four times greater than projected, received a major increase. The bill provided $28.7 million, $2.1 million more than in 1995 and the same as the President requested.</p><p>Conservatives have criticized the arts endowment for financing controversial, some say obscene, projects and have maintained that the National Endowment for the Humanities has favored liberal causes in doling out money for media grants, museums, and historical organizations.</p><p>Officials of the two programs have been reluctant to comment on proposed cuts out of concern that they would be seen to be lobbying legislators.</p><p>While much of the wrangling of the past two days has focused on the endowments, Democrats have also charged that the Republicans are using the Interior appropriations bill to weaken environmental laws and programs. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, called the cuts in the National Biological Service "a back-door means of gutting the Endangered Species Act."</p><p>The bill provides $53 million for the protection of endangered species, $16 million less than in 1995. But it does not provide money for expanding the endangered species list, pending reauthorization of the 22-year-old Endangered Species Act.</p>                </div>
