                    <p>Most days, Garth Brooks is a chart-topping country singer and international celebrity. Today he was a political lobbyist, pounding shoe leather along the Capitol's tiled hallways, trying to argue a suddenly pinchpenny Congress out of its determination to cut Federal subsidies to the arts.</p><p>So were some 350 cultural leaders, heartthrob musicians, actors and other artists, famous and anonymous. It was not at all clear that they made much headway.</p><p>Mr. Brooks and the rest descended on Capitol Hill for Arts Advocacy Day, a lobbying foray sponsored by the nonprofit American Council for the Arts and financed by corporate donations. The council has conducted similar annual expeditions over the last 14 years, usually with some assurance that a Democratic-run Congress would protect both its interests and its financing.</p><p>That changed when the last election swept into power a wave of fiscal and social conservatives. And the lobbying group that gathered in a Capitol office building early this morning for the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs and celebrity pep talks carried away a slightly bitter aftertaste.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"I got down here early yesterday in order to have an hour or two at the National Gallery of Art," the actor Tony Randall said. "It is one of the glories of our nation." Mr. Randall spent another minute extolling the gallery's art treasures, then gave the crowd some advice for its day of political buttonholing: "As you speak to the Congressmen today," he said in a stage whisper, "don't tell them about it."</p><p>Christopher Reeve, the stage and motion-picture actor best known for his Hollywood role as Superman, said the arts advocates face "a tough fight, because the Republican Party is going to have to accommodate the religious right as they run up to the '96 election."</p><p>"We're going to have political survival versus the best interests of the country," said Mr. Reeve, "but of course, that's an old story in this town, and I don't think we should be intimidated by it."</p><p>But in a town where deficit-minded legislators are already wiping out heating subsidies to the poor and scaling back budget projections for school lunches, the question of the nation's best interest is no longer so clear-cut.</p><p>The amount of money at stake in the lobbying battle is comparatively tiny. The lobbyists sought primarily to protect the National Endowment for the Arts, the $167 million-a-year Federal agency whose grants to artists are the mainstay of Federal cultural subsidies, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which will spend about $170 million this year on such cultural projects as the preservation of newspapers and historical research. A third arts agency, the $28 million-a-year Institute for Museum Services, is probably safe from serious budget cutting.</p><p>But the size of the agencies' budgets -- only about 70 cents per citizen for the arts endowment, supporters like to argue -- is not much in the debate. Rather, the lobbyists are battling a belief among Congress's new majority that the arts endowment is a spawning ground for such works as Andres Serrano's crucifix submerged in urine, which even endowment supporters have found it hard to defend.</p><p>Michael Greene, the Georgian who is president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, contended today that argument about the nature of federally financed art is "demagoguery," in part because the process of awarding grants has been changed. The issue, he said, is whether the Government will help bring arts to the people or whether it will end subsidies and allow control of culture to revert to corporate czars in Hollywood and Manhattan.</p><p>In many cases, Mr. Greene said, classical music, jazz and regional styles of music exist only in Governnent-subsidized radio and performances. Commercially, he said, they are smothered by "the unbelievable amount of sludge" that dominates radio and television. "Pop, rock, rap and country," he said. "That's it."</p><p>Still, for Congress's new majority, the question is whether the Federal Government should have any role at all in supporting the arts, and if so, whether a nation with a $5 trillion debt can afford it.</p><p>"There is an element in Congress that thinks that if you can't cut the N.E.A., there's not a lot of hope for cutting anything," said Frank Collins, the chief of staff to Representative Randy Cunningham, a San Diego Republican who heads the House Education subcommittee that authorizes spending for the arts and humanities endowments.</p><p>Mr. Cunningham, a man with deep doubts about the endowment, was a prime target for lobbyists today. Mr. Greene trooped to his office after picking up two stars of commercial radio: the singer Michael Bolton and the saxophonist Kenny G.</p><p>Kenny G ("Just call me G"), a self-effacing curly-haired man in a dark suit, said along the way that the arts endowment had played a major role in his development as a musician while he attended the University of Washington in the 1970's. An organization subsidized by the endowment, he said, took his class to Port Washington, where he met Lew Tabackin, a veteran saxophone player who proved to have an enduring influence on his music.</p><p>After the session with Mr. Cunningham, Kenny G said he was pleased. "He was very receptive," he said. "He shared some insight with us. I was inspired by it."</p><p>Mr. Collins, the representative's chief of staff, was more muted. "Other than swinging his musical tastes from solid country to a little jazz, I don't think it had a great impact," he said.</p><p>Mr. Brooks, the country star, had an even bigger assignment. At noon, he strode into the office of Speaker Newt Gingrich, a leading critic of Federal spending on the arts, to make the lobbyists' case and to pose with several House employees for photographs.</p><p>Mr. Gingrich took Mr. Brooks, who was clad in jeans, cowboy boots, a suede jacket and his trademark wide-brim hat, out on the Capitol balcony for a stunning view of the Mall. But they did not talk about art.</p><p>"What's that net?" Mr. Brooks asked, pointing to a thin webbing that hung from the balcony top.</p><p>"Pigeons," the speaker replied. "It's an unending problem."</p><p>Mr. Brooks later said that Mr. Gingrich "said a lot of cool things," and that he had told the speaker that most Federal spending on the arts benefited small towns, not wealthy big-city arts organizations. Mr. Gingrich, asked about his position on Federal funds for the arts, answered, "Don't know yet."</p><p>Later, Mr. Brooks posed for photographs outside the Senate chamber and enthusiastically shook hands with another strong critic of arts subsidies, Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican.</p><p>Asked later whether the encounter had softened his opposition, Mr. Gramm was resolute. "I like Garth Brooks's music, and if he wants to give me advice about country music, I'll take it," Mr. Gramm said. "But not about spending taxpayers' dollars."</p><p>Photo: Webster Young and other musicians took part in Arts Advocacy Day.
