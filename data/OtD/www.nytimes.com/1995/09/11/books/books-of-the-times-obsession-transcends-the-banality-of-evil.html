                    <p>HANNAH ARENDT -- MARTIN HEIDEGGER  By Elzbieta Ettinger  139 pages. Yale University Press. $16.</p><p>The image of Hannah Arendt, the author of "The Origins of Totalitarianism" and coiner of the expression "the banality of evil," hangs on her intellectual brilliance and authority. How strange it is to learn then, in Elzbieta Ettinger's sensitive account of her private life, that Arendt was subject to a lifelong irrational attachment, irrational in the sense that its object was a man whose evil she was unable to see, even though it was all too visible to others.</p><p>The man was Martin Heidegger, the German philosopher and author of "Being and Time." Heidegger was one of the most profound thinkers of the century, but his reputation has been fatally tarnished by the revelation that he was an enthusiastic supporter of National Socialism and a member of the Nazi Party.</p><p>The paradox is that the German-Jewish Arendt, who began a four-year sexual relationship with Heidegger in 1924 when she was a student and sustained an emotional attachment to him until her death 51 years later, played a major role in rehabilitating him after World War II. Heidegger told her in 1950, when they met for the first time in 17 years, that his reputation had been destroyed by a campaign of vilification, and Arendt believed him.</p>                </div>

                    <p>And so, even as she was writing her path-breaking analysis of the nature of totalitarianism and anti-Semitism, Arendt remained blindly devoted to a figure who represented the totalitarian evil. She traveled from America to Germany to visit him, published influential essays exonerating him and supervised English translations of his works. In this sense, Ms. Ettinger, who is a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tells a sad story, one whose lesson seems to be that even the most normally hardheaded and morally uncompromising of thinkers can will herself into suspending belief when emotion is powerful enough.</p><p>Ms. Ettinger's account is succinct and straightforward, though at times so succinct that it feels skimpy, more an hors d'oeuvre than a main course.  Her story of the sentimental relationship between Hannah and Martin, which began when she was his 18-year-old student at the University of Marburg in Germany, is based largely on recently discovered letters and several interviews with people who knew them both. Early on, Ms. Ettinger advances a hypothesis: it is that Heidegger's "romantic predisposition seems to have led him both to a passionate attachment to Hannah Arendt and to a fascination with the Nazi vision of the rebirth of Germany."</p><p>Unfortunately neither logic nor Ms. Ettinger's tale substantiates this idea. There have, after all, been many men with romantic predispositions toward women who manifested no sympathy for the concepts of racial purity, ultranationalism and global conquest. Besides, it may certainly have been passion that led the married Catholic 35-year-old Professor Heidegger to initiate a love affair with one of his female students, but his passion for Hannah was briefer than his passion for National Socialism. He, not she, broke off the intimate relationship, substituting for it a strange on-again, off-again association in which Heidegger, self-centered, cunning and manipulative, was merely needful of Arendt's worshipful attention.</p><p>Still, Ms. Ettinger's tale is absorbing and cruelly fascinating. She is scrupulously attentive to the known facts and unsparing in her exposure of both Heidegger's mendacity and Arendt's propensity for self-deception where the philosopher was concerned. Point by point she dismantles the structure of illusion that Arendt built around her former teacher and lover. A central ingredient of that structure, for example, was Arendt's belief that Heidegger's problems stemmed from his wife, Elfride, whose biases and resentments, she thought, undermined her husband's prestige "and created an atmosphere of hostility around him."</p><p>"By shifting the entire blame for Heidegger's past onto his wife," Ms. Ettinger observes, "Arendt absolved him, the personification of the Geist, of any responsibility and therefore could in good conscience resume the role of muse and, most significantly, come to terms with herself and her fascination with him."</p><p>Several elements in this situation make it all the more astonishing, among them Arendt's clairvoyance about the mesmerizing appeal of tyranny and, of course, her own Jewishness. In 1933, the year Hitler took power, Heidegger joined the Nazi Party; Arendt began her exile from Germany, first in Paris (where she got a job with an organization that trained Jewish youth for agricultural labor in Palestine), later in the United States.</p><p>Then there was the enormity of Heidegger's offenses. They included not only Nazi Party membership but help in banning prominent Jews -- including his own teacher and patron, Edmund Husserl -- from German University faculties and ruining the careers of colleagues deemed insufficiently devoted to the Nazi cause. Heidegger blocked the promotion of one former student by writing a confidential memo accusing him of having become "closely tied to the Jew Frankel, formerly employed at Gottingen, and now dismissed from this university."</p><p>Ms. Ettinger skillfully traces the transformation of Arendt's early infatuation with Heidegger into a misguided fidelity, though the skimpiness of the narrative is sometimes disappointing, especially in the early chapters.</p><p>She evokes the letter that Heidegger wrote to the young Arendt in which he first hinted at his feelings for her, but though she describes it as "lyrical, beautifully phrased, a subtle caress and a firm statement," she neither quotes from it nor informs the reader why she fails to do so.</p><p>Still, Ms. Ettinger makes a persistent effort to account for the main factor in the story, which is Arendt's love itself, attributing it to the power of Heidegger's intellect and a personal magnetism that in its way affected other major figures of German intellectual life also.</p><p>In the end, Heidegger is the villain in Ms. Ettinger's account. Arendt's uncharacteristic lack of good judgment about him emerges as only all too human, diminishing nothing of the value of her work or her scholarly integrity. And yet, how is it that the shrewd observer of the banality of evil could have failed to see the banal evil of a man like Heidegger?</p><p>Ms. Ettinger's book gives us the facts of the story, but that ultimate question remains a mystery.</p><p>Photos: Martin Heidegger, in 1934, and Hannah Arendt, about 1930.</p>                </div>
