Sun Myung Moon received an honorary degree today from the University of Bridgeport, which he effectively took over three years ago.</p><p>In his first public appearance on campus since an affiliate of his Unification Church rescued the university from bankruptcy and near-certain closure, Mr. Moon, 75, took credit for the collapse of Communism and promised to resolve conflicts in the Middle East and between North and South Korea.</p><p>"What I have proclaimed has come to pass," the gravelly voiced Mr. Moon, in black academic robes, told a 935-seat auditorium crowded with professors, students and many adherents. "The entire world did everything it could to put an end to me, yet I did not die, and today I am firmly standing on top of the world."</p><p>Since the university's takeover, officials have insisted that Mr. Moon and his church have not influenced its curriculum or packed the enrollment with its adherents, portraying it as like any other private university, but with an unusual source of financing.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But to critics, the speech, which spoke of establishing a closer relationship to God to bring about a united world, was one more confirmation that a once sturdy university had been taken over by a religious cult with a messianic and proselytizing mission. One local opponent of Mr. Moon, Rabbi Israel C. Stein, led a protest outside the Arnold Bernhard Arts and Humanities Center and engaged in a verbal skirmish with a Unification Church member.</p><p>"You're a lost soul," a furious Rabbi Stein told John Williams, a 41-year-old church member.</p><p>"Obviously, your mind isn't open," an insistently composed Mr. Williams responded.</p><p>The college, founded in 1927 on the Connecticut seashore, chose to honor Mr. Moon as its greatest benefactor, providing $98 million since 1992.</p><p>In an interview, the college's new president, Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein, a Harvard-trained historian of religion and an ordained rabbi who has been a friend of Mr. Moon's for 20 years, said: "If you have somebody who's that much of a benefactor, you don't just shake his hand and say thank you. Without him, the university would have died."</p><p>But Dr. Rubenstein made clear in conferring the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters that Mr. Moon was also being honored as a "religious leader whose vocation has been unfolding before our eyes" and a man of true "spiritual power."</p><p>The nature and scope of the church's influence at the university is a matter of debate.</p><p>In an interview, Dr. Rubenstein said: "The idea that somehow the Moonies have come and taken over is not borne out by the facts. This is a normal American university with a unique funding source."</p><p>But local critics like City Councilman William A. Finch and Rabbi Stein say Mr. Moon's followers have been been dangling $20,000 scholarships to foreign students in exchange for their taking church training that features brainwashing techniques like sleep deprivation and isolation from family and friends. They say Mr. Moon has been using these students as "mules" to bring money into the country to spend in widening his political influence with conservative legislators, a prime motive for his creation of The Washington Times newspaper.</p><p>Dr. Rubenstein says the Unification Church rescued an American university for the same altruistic motives that Roman Catholic and Protestant groups have started colleges: "to spread knowledge."</p><p>Dr. Rubenstein, 71, a longtime professor at Florida State University and author of several books on the Holocaust, served with several groups affiliated with the Unification Church and was a trustee of Bridgeport before becoming president.</p><p>Many who weathered the financial calamity, like Deanna Schwartz, who teaches English to foreign students, would rather not question Mr. Moon's motives. "We don't belabor that," she said.</p><p>The Unification Church, through an arm called the Professors World Peace Academy, has given the university $98 million in exchange for appointing a majority of the 34 trustees and at least two top administrators. Officials say that enrollment, which had sunk as low as 1,100 after a two-year faculty strike, highly publicized crimes related to the campus's proximity to a high-crime neighborhood and Bridgeport's fiscal problems, is up to 1,800.</p><p>While faculty members deny any overt interference by the church in course content or teaching, the college has started an ethics institute that sponsors conferences on issues like biomedical ethics. It is run by Dr. Anthony J. Guerra, the college's dean, who is a member of the Unification Church.</p><p>During a midday visit this week, the 86-acre campus, built for 10,000 students, had the desolate feel of a ghost town. Two or three students at a time ambled to classes among the parched lawns and frayed walks. There were no classic campus scenes of young people hurling Frisbees, strumming guitars or necking on the grass.</p><p>Part of the reason for the ambiance is that few of the university's daytime students are American. Many are from Korea, Japan, Yugoslavia and elsewhere.</p><p>Dr. Rubenstein says 25 percent of the students are foreign, but concedes that the percentage for daytime students is higher, and faculty members say it is closer to 80 percent. Critics say working- and middle-class students from Bridgeport and New York City have shunned the university because of the Moon connection, and Dr. Rubenstein admits the problem.</p><p>"I would be delighted to get middle-class Jewish students from Long Island and New York the way we once did, but they're not coming and we're not going to lay down and die," he said.</p><p>The university admits it has been aggressively recruiting abroad, offering 200 full scholarships. Anna Kleshelskaya, 17, from Moscow, said she had picked Bridgeport because she had "heard that scholarships are given by Moon. " She denied any contacts with Unification members, but two Russian students held a news conference in 1993 to say their scholarships hinged on attending Unification Church "leadership seminars" that included "brainwashing, sleep deprivation and coercion."</p><p>On campus, not one of a dozen students asked by a reporter acknowledged membership in the Unification Church, nor did they know more than two or three Moonies, as they are often called. The college says it does not keep track of religious affiliations.</p><p>Some students seemed wary of the Moon association.</p><p>"I didn't come here for political reasons, I came for the chiropractic school," said Rob Siconolfi, 24, who transferred from the University of Bloomfield in New Jersey.</p><p>"They're like nonexistent," Denise Monteiro, 21, of Queens, said of the Moon adherents. "As far as trying to brainwash here, that doesn't happen."</p><p>Miss Monteiro, a fine arts major on a full scholarship, said her only contact with the church was in relation to an essay about a speech on family life given at a church-sponsored event. She won $700 for her essay, she said, though she didn't consider the prize money an enticement to join the church.</p><p>Senior professors willing to talk seem reconciled to the transformation. Some, like Glenn A. Bassett, director of the business school and a Bridgeport professor for 15 years, have even taken a closer look at the Unification church and decided that it is not all that different from mainstream religious groups.</p><p>Asked, for instance, about the reports of sleepless nights of indoctrination, Dr. Bassett said "a good number of industries followed that in terms of training management." The mass wedding ceremonies Mr. Moon sponsors for thousands of arranged marriages are no more bizarre, he said, than marriages born of a singles bar.</p><p>He said, "It would be nice if we were a prestigious university and people were beating down my doors to publish my books." But given the choices the university faced three years ago, he said, he and his colleagues are pleased "we're alive."</p><p>Photos: Rabbi Israel C. Stein, right, has charged that Unification Church training features brainwashing techniques. Yesterday, he confronted John Williams, a church member, at the University of Bridgeport.
