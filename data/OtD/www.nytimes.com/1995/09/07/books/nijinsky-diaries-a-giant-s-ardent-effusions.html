The nondescript little black notebooks could have been used by an industrious young scholar for note taking. But tumbling out across the lined pages are the fevered thoughts and emotions of one of the great artists of the century, Vaslav Nijinsky, in a diary written in 1918 and 1919, at the start of a descent into schizophrenia that ended the Russian dancer's career.   Now, the diary may be viewed for the first time in America in &quot;The Collecting Adventure, 1895-1995,&quot; a yearlong, rotating exhibition that celebrates the centennial of the New York Public Library. The diary will be on view through Oct. 4 in the Edna Barnes Salomon Room of the library's Center for the Humanities on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, together with a drawing by Nijinsky, a photograph of him and 11 photographs of George Balanchine and the New York City Ballet.">

                    <p>An extra-meticulous accountant could have written these pages, so neat and sure is the handwriting. The nondescript little black notebooks could have been used by an industrious young scholar for note taking. But tumbling out across the lined pages are the fevered thoughts and emotions of one of the great artists of the century, Vaslav Nijinsky, in a diary written in 1918 and 1919, at the start of a descent into schizophrenia that ended the Russian dancer's career.</p><p>Now, the diary may be viewed for the first time in America in "The Collecting Adventure, 1895-1995," a yearlong, rotating exhibition that celebrates the centennial of the New York Public Library. The diary will be on view through Oct. 4 in the Edna Barnes Salomon Room of the library's Center for the Humanities on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, together with a drawing by Nijinsky, a photograph of him and 11 photographs of George Balanchine and the New York City Ballet.</p><p>All, including the diary, are part of the holdings of the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. The library acquired the diary in the fall of 1994, 15 years after it first bid on the books. In 1993, the diaries were exhibited at Dansmuseet, a dance museum in Stockholm, which put in a word for the library with the Swedish collector who was their previous owner.</p><p>"We got word to the owner, who is, was and will always be anonymous, that we wanted to acquire the diary," Madeleine Nichols, curator of the collection, said in a recent interview. Messages went back and forth between the collector's agent and the library. "I'd get these little notes that I had to assume were serious," Ms. Nichols recalled. " 'Informal' is how I'd have to describe them. So I continued to be on tenterhooks."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Eventually a handwritten fax arrived from the agent announcing that the collector had decided to sell the diaries to the library. Ms. Nichols was prepared with a substantial amount of library acquisition money and private donations, an amount she declines to disclose, though she said the collection is still accepting donations.</p><p>"We've had our eye on the Nijinsky diary," Robert Marx, executive director of the library, said. "It was considered the highest acquisition for the dance collection for many years, so we've been preparing."</p><p>Ms. Nichols did not quite believe the good news at first, so she asked a member of the collection's advisory committee who had seen the books to accompany her to the closing. "I had to make certain these were the diaries," she said. Did she break open a bottle of champagne when the deed was finally done? "No, I just thought about getting them microfilmed so people could look at them," Ms. Nichols said. The copy may be seen by the public starting on Sept. 18, when the collection reopens after renovation.</p><p>For all the confusion and pain of his observations on dance, life and sex, Nijinsky intended the diary to be made public. But the version his wife, Romola, published in 1936 was heavily edited and a later version, published in 1953, was even more bowdlerized. Romola Nijinsky died in 1978, but Nijinsky's daughters, Kyra and Tamara, continued to refuse permission for a full publication. In 1993 Tamara relented, and the unexpurgated diary was published in France earlier this year. An English translation is scheduled to be published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux late next year.</p><p>Nijinsky was recognized as a phenomenon -- an exotic who seemed to inhabit the air when he danced -- soon after he joined the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg in 1907. He went on to even greater fame in Europe as a star dancer in Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and as the choreographer of ballets that shocked audiences with their haunting intensity of emotion and sometimes violent primitivism.</p><p>The ballets were rejected, and Nijinsky's marriage to Romola in 1913 caused a rupture with Diaghilev, although the impresario arranged for his release from internment in Hungary during World War I. Nijinsky's last public appearance was a bizarre solo performance in 1919 in a Swiss hotel. He died in 1950, at the age of 60.</p><p>Diaghilev was Nijinsky's lover, a relationship that Romola Nijinsky denied but that is made clear in the diaries. She deleted about a third of the diary, including references to Diaghilev, comments about her that she felt were harsh, pages of dance notation, and abstract drawings of intersecting circles and eyelike ovals.</p><p>Many of the edited passages were sexually explicit. But times have changed. "A lot of the sexual references mean little now," Ms. Nichols said. "You hear them on the street all the time. And it is not a revelation now to find out that he was a lover of Diaghilev." What is more interesting to Ms. Nichols, she said, is the growing popularity and influence of his ballets, "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" and "Le Sacre du Printemps."</p><p>Ms. Nichols would like one day to publish a facsimile edition of the diaries, as well as a collection of Nijinsky drawings and photographs of the dancer that the family still owns. But both would be expensive projects. For now, there is the poignant voice that cries out through that careful Russian script.</p><p>"I want to write this book because I want to explain what feeling is," Nijinsky observes in the diary. "I am feeling in the flesh and not intelligence in the flesh. I am the flesh. I am feeling. I am God. I am simple. I do not need to think. I need to feel and to understand through feeling."</p><p>Photo: Vaslav Nijinsky. (United Press International) (pg. C17)</p>                </div>
