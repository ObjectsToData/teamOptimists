                    <p>Like the dispirited troops of a defeated army, Democrats and Congressional staff members prepared to relinquish cherished posts and cluttered, file-filled cabinets on the eve of the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives. Lunch gatherings were grim, partings tearful and wishes for the new year filled with gallows humor.</p><p>At the Ford Annex building, Judi Greenwald introduced several colleagues as they were packing: "We're with the subcommittee on energy and power. At least we are until the end of the day."</p><p>The absolute, and at times absolutely capricious, exercise of power on Capitol Hill was a recurrent theme throughout that long goodbye. Each of those staff members had known for nearly a year that they would be unemployed come 1995, since Representative Philip R. Sharp, the Indiana Democrat for whom they all worked, chose not to run for re-election. But not one had expected to be part of a broader exodus.</p><p>"We knew a long time ago," Ms. Greenwald said. "We just didn't have any idea that we were going to be in a whole throng of people."</p>                </div>

                    <p>For Leon Lowery, the departure had great import. "Not only have you lost your personal job," he said, "but people are telling you that the whole ideology you represent has been rejected by America. Personally, professionally, emotionally -- any level you take -- it's pretty tough."</p><p>Shelley Fidler just grimaced. "Leon has been reading the Bible," she said. "Lamentations."</p><p>Mr. Lowery raised an eyebrow. "A lot of people don't believe in government," he said with a touch of devilish revenge. "But now they are going to have to run it."</p><p>Not everyone caught up in the change was so morose. While assorted Democrats fretted, feted and gnashed, Representative Newt Gingrich and his newly minted Republican majority were champing at the bit for power. Parties around the city were full of Republican revelers still toasting the November victory, while the newly anointed seemed as anxious as first-time suitors as they prepared to move into new offices.</p><p>Washington's permanent population was already figuring to profit from the shift. Among the first businesses to capitalize on the change has been that most ephemeral and yet most constant of Washington power bases: the trendy restaurants in which dining and doing business combine.</p><p>"Republicans eat, too," said Steven Damato, the owner of Nora's, a homey-trendy restaurant that is a favorite of President Clinton's family. Mr. Damato said the restaurant would be host to a Republican event on Tuesday, one night before the 104th Congress convenes.</p><p>And the future looks good, too. "Change is wonderful for business," Mr. Damato said. "The restaurants will be packed full of special interests."</p><p>Real estate agents were crowing as well, using the most potent of Washington put-offs to inform reporters that they were simply too busy to talk. Several moaned that they could not stay on the phone for more than a few minutes since their appointments with incoming power brokers were stacked like salmon jumping the rapids.</p><p>"There has been an awful lot of scurrying around," said a very rushed Mike Frias, an agent at John Forman Real Estate.</p><p>By most accounts, the new Washingtonians were settling as near as possible to ground zero, in the Victorian row houses and quaint apartments on the tree-lined but sometimes crime-infested streets near Capitol Hill.</p><p>It makes for a blissfully short commute and great public relations bites. "These folks come in extremely early, work late. If they have a break, they want to go home," Mr. Frias said.</p><p>But few have been buying properties. "New members are not interested in giving their constituency the impression that they are becoming entrenched," Mr. Frias said. Or else, just maybe, they have a clear and present sense of the fickleness of a disgruntled electorate.</p><p>Over in Federal buildings where unsuspecting professionals have been chopped out of politics in part of a general restructuring initiated by Mr. Gingrich, confusion and resentment mixed with a poignant sense of purpose.</p><p>"I guess I am looking for a job," said Dr. Raymond W. Smock, the recently out-of-work House historian, who had to inform his staff of five that they were also abruptly unemployed since the office was decreed closed by the incoming Speaker. "But, hey, I'm not complaining. Five thousand Amtrak employees are out of work. Nobody has any sympathy for anybody on the Hill who lost his job."</p><p>In Federal buildings on Capitol Hill this week, offices were exchanged and furniture dragged about in the traditional horse trading that comes with the flip-flop of minority and majority slots. Republicans moved into majority cubbyholes. Members of the former majority slipped down to minority digs, and some offices closed for good as part of the extensive restructuring.</p><p>It is hard, though, to quantify the scope of change just now. The House historian's office cannot say because data from the 104th Congress is not yet in. By the time the statistics emerge, the historian's office itself will be long gone.</p><p>Last week, even the House clerk's staff could not answer basic questions. Inquiries about staff changes, personnel cutbacks and committee clear-outs were referred to Mr. Gingrich's office with the advice: "Ask him. He's the guy with the power. He's only one who knows what's happening."</p><p>Longtime residents of Washington are used to all of this. The capital's equivalent of a stiff upper lip is a sense of denial. "We're used to this," said countless members of the newly unemployed. "It's politics."</p><p>Subsets of the city were already gearing up for an adrenaline rush, though. John Brademas, the chairman of the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities, girded for guerrilla warfare. A longtime Democratic Congressman from Indiana and a former president of New York University, he knows how to play politics.</p><p>After acknowledging that financing for the arts, education and humanities was a prominent Republican target for the cutting board, Mr. Brademas mentioned almost casually that most of the prominent board members of major opera companies, museums, theater groups were powerful Republicans with ample funds and huge political leverage.</p><p>"We're not quite sure what's going to happen yet," he said. "But savage reductions in these programs would mark a giant step backwards. And at least in my experience -- which stretches back to Eisenhower -- every government has come up with funds."</p><p>Fine and well for opera performers if that record holds. But the House historian, Dr. Smock, really was watching history pass by. Tapping his foot against a nondescript wooden crate last week, he mentioned that its contents were the private letters and papers of Speaker Joseph G. Cannon, whose rule ended in 1911.</p><p>"It doesn't look like something out of 'The Raiders of the Lost Ark,' " Dr. Smock said, creaking the crate open. "But, hey, it's the real thing."</p><p>Photos: Leon Lowery, left, and Tom Runge, at a farewell party last week for the staff of the House subcommittee on energy and power.
