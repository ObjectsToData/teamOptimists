    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THE Hudson Valley Writers Center returned to its roots recently, sponsoring a live reading by the poet Rita Dove at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts here. A large audience packed Caramoor's antique-studded Music Room to listen to Ms. Dove, who just three days earlier had completed her term as Poet Laureate of the United States.         If anyone expected a staid figure to recite austere verses on the state of the nation, the effervescent -- and at times irreverent -- Ms. Dove quickly puts such ideas to rest. At 42, she is the youngest person and the first black American to be appointed to the office. Vibrant in a brightly patterned shirt and black pants, she also wore a curly haircut, long fingernails painted different colors and spikey high-heeled shoes.   ">

Vibrant in a brightly patterned shirt and black pants, she also wore a curly haircut, long fingernails painted different colors and spikey high-heeled shoes.</p><p>A Poet Laureate is "not required to write official poems -- phew!" she said  at the outset, disarming her audience with a warm smile. Instead, "Someone asks  you to have a few words to say" on an occasion.</p><p>Paying rapt attention in the front rows were 20 students from Woodlands High  School in Greenburgh, whom the Writers Center had invited. Others had paid up to $50 for the reading and a reception with Ms. Dove afterward that served as a fund-raising event for the Writers Center. Founded by a group of poets in 1983,  the organization now includes many novelists, essayists and other nonfiction writers.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The recipient of many fellowships and awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, Ms. Dove was appointed by the Librarian of Congress in 1993 and served for two years, the maximum term for Poet Laureate. She had her own office with a sweeping view of Washington; in fact, she said, the view provided her with one of her very first poems in the job.</p><p>Looking down at the parking lot one day, she recalled, she noticed a statue that had been removed for repair from its usual perch atop the Capitol Building. Encased in scaffolding, the usually regal statue looks "awkward and out of place," she said, and embodied the same "mixture of beauty and admonishment that one can feel going past a homeless person." The observation led to the poem, "Lady Freedom Among Us," which Ms. Dove read at the ceremony to reinstall the statue.</p><p>"I'm not sure the politicians gathered there really understood the poem," she said. That was not her only barb at Congress. "Capitol Hill is Oz," she said, provoking laughter. "The attack on the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities has little to do with literature. It has to do with power and what you can bully down."</p><p>Before reading "Parsley," a long poem about language abuse, she reminded the  audience that "evil can be creative and intelligent." The work was about weeding out so-called aliens by the way they pronounce words -- a tactic employed by Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic in 1957 when he ordered the execution of 20,000 blacks who could not correctly pronounce the Spanish "r." The poem ends with this line: "He will order many, this time, to be killed for a single, beautiful word."</p><p>In a less ironic mode, she read poems that invoked the seasons -- like "November for Beginners" -- and others that recalled her childhood in Ohio. "Sunday Greens" from "Thomas and Beulah," a collection about her grandparents for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1987, told of collards and ham cooking.</p><p>From Southern black tradition she moved to Greek mythology, reading from "Mother Love," her latest book. The work is a collection of sonnets weaving a modern mother's pain at losing her daughter to sexual maturity with the agriculture goddess Demeter's loss of her daughter Persephone to the Underworld. "I never thought I'd be writing sonnets," Ms. Dove said. "but if the Muse gives  you sonnets, you take them and go with it."</p><p>A woman in the audience asked about self-censorship. "You can't censor yourself," she said. "It's death." Asked what she would advise young writers, she answered, "Read, read, read. Have an absolute love of the language itself. Read poetry, prose and the backs of cereal boxes." When writing, she said, "Be able to separate the emotional investment in the poem from the craft of writing  it; that helps in the revision stage."</p><p>After the reading, Ms. Dove met members of the audience and autographed copies of "Mother Love." Charlotte Brathwaite, a 12th grader at Woodlands High School, said the poet had inspired her. "I liked what she said about technique,  and separating yourself from the poem," Ms. Brathwaite said. Marsha Moon, another Woodlands 12th grader, said she had read "Mother Love" before coming and hadn't understood some of the poems. Now that she had heard the poet, she said,  she understood them better.</p><p>Stephanie Strickland, a poet and a member of the Writers Center, saw a poignancy in the event's success. "I'm hearing nothing but racial division in this country, but this was a totally harmonious gathering," she said, motioning  toward the black high school students and the many white adults at the reception. "People were brought together because of a writer. That's something that needs to happen -- the coming together of cultural communities -- but not just in a trial" like that of O. J. Simpson. "This has to happen in an atmosphere of celebration and reconciliation," she said.</p><p>Back in the Music Room, the excited students posed for photographs with Ms. Dove. Her long-term job is teaching English at the University of Virginia; she lives nearby with her husband, who is a novelist, and a young daughter. Noting that her duties as Poet Laureate had set her creative efforts back a year, she said, "I can't wait to get back to my writer's cabin."</p><p>The Writers Center will present the writer Curtis Harnack in the last program of its fall series at the Warner Library in Tarrytown on Dec. 2 at 3 P.M.</p><p>For more information about the Hudson Valley Writers Center, the number to call is 332-5953.</p><p>Photo: Rita Dove after a live reading at Caramoor in Katonah.
