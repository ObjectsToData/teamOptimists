Auschwitz didn't just demonstrate the ease with which their entire community could be reduced to household products; it turned their very identity into a contradiction in terms. It was the ultimate rebuff to what  Walter Benjamin once called the German Jew's "unrequited love" for Germany.</p><p>This exquisitely personal sense of loss, in any case, is the explanation of choice for scholars struggling to understand how Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger -- the German Jewish debunker of totalitarianism and the Nazi philosopher -- who were lovers before the war, could have become friends again after. "I think she did not want to believe that what had happened had contaminated the past completely," says Seyla Benhabib, a political philosopher  who teaches at Harvard. "She wanted to believe that something could have been saved after the catastrophe." Beyond that, says Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, author of the definitive Arendt biography and the first to write about the affair, in 1982, "I think Arendt knew that Heidegger was, among 20th-century philosophers,  a towering figure."</p><p>There is one explanation, however, that nobody proposed. It would have been too crude, too distressing; it would have forced us to fantasize an Arendt -- a  thinker of exemplary moral seriousness -- so in the thrall of her first great love that on catching sight of him again, she flings ethical reasoning to the winds. Until Elzbieta Ettinger published her book "Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger" last month, no one had dared hint at such things. And while almost every Arendt scholar in America and several in Germany (where the book appeared  this summer) and not a few Heideggerians would happily consign Ms. Ettinger's book to the tabloid hell they figure it sprang from -- "It did have a very bodice-ripping romantic streak to it, don't you think?" asks Thomas Sheehan, a Heidegger scholar -- there is not much anybody can do about it, because Ms. Ettinger had something none of them had: access to Arendt and Heidegger's letters.</p><p>"I will tell you how this whole thing came about," says Lotte Kohler, a friend of Arendt's who is now executor of the Hannah Arendt Literary Trust. "These letters, this correspondence, was very dear to her heart." When Arendt died in 1975, she asked Ms. Kohler to give them to the archive in Germany in which Heidegger had deposited his papers. "Of course, I made copies of them before I put them there," Ms. Kohler continues. "Very soon after it became known that her letters were there, Martin Heidegger's son Hermann put restrictions on  the correspondence. No access. Nobody is supposed to read it." Nearly 20 years later, she says, "I wrote to Hermann Heidegger and I said: 'Both philosophers are dead. I think something should be done. I think serious scholars should have access to the correspondence.' "</p>                </div>

                    <p>That the first to benefit from Ms. Kohler's new policy was Ms. Ettinger was something of an accident; she had simply applied at the right time. Ms. Ettinger, a professor of humanities at M.I.T. and, like Arendt, a refugee as well as a Holocaust survivor -- she grew up in the Warsaw ghetto -- wished to write a biography of Arendt, and asked the estate for permission to read the letters. Ms. Kohler read Ms. Ettinger's previous biography, of Rosa Luxemburg, and liked it. But not long after she allowed Ms. Ettinger to read transcripts of the letters, the biographer granted an interview to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The newspaper published bits of Arendt's side of the correspondence (Hermann Heidegger had given Ms. Ettinger permission only to look at his father's letters, not quote from them), and Ms. Ettinger realized that the story of the affair would make a good book in its own right. "When she told me she wants to publish just this chapter of the biography, I said, 'Oh, this is terrible,' " Ms. Kohler says. She and Mr. Heidegger -- who says he spotted "50 mistakes" in the German edition of Ms. Ettinger's book, although he will not enumerate them -- have now resolved to publish the correspondence; a book is scheduled to appear in about two years.</p><p>Perhaps what is most terrible about Ms. Ettinger's decision, for Ms. Kohler,  is the wrath it has brought down upon her head. "The estate should have a policy of not making those correspondences available until they're available, if you know what I mean," an annoyed Elisabeth Young-Bruehl says. "Otherwise, you get one person's interpretation and nobody can check it." Ms. Benhabib, who is just  finishing a book on Arendt's relationship to modernity, had asked to see the letters sometime after Ms. Ettinger did: "I wanted to know how Arendt assessed the transformations of Heidegger's thought." Her request was denied, because by  then Ms. Ettinger, the estate and her German publisher, Piper, were caught up in a lawsuit involving Ms. Ettinger's claims that a Heidegger biographer had plagiarized her as-yet-unpublished manuscript. Ms. Benhabib says the experience  left her "strongly disappointed" with Arendt's estate.</p>                </div>
