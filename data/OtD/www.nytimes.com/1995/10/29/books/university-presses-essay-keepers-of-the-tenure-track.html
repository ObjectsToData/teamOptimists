    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  IF you were a graduate student in the 80's and subject to the general delusion that held literary criticism to be the ne plus ultra of intellectual thrill, then you too probably owned one of these: an oversize paperback with an austere cover and small-type title that, grouped with three or more of its kind on your bookshelf, confirmed your status as an avatar of predoctoral chic. The object in question was a volume in the University of Minnesota series called &quot;Theory and History of Literature&quot; -- any volume, since they all looked alike and were each equally tantalizing, coming as they did in a wide variety of colors. There were Hans Robert Jauss's &quot;Toward an Aesthetics of Reception&quot; (pink), Paul de Man's &quot;Blindness and Insight&quot; (powder blue) and Jean-Francois Lyotard's &quot;Postmodern Condition&quot; (lurid aquamarine). There were Mikhail Bakhtin's &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics&quot; (sunflower yellow) and Michel de Certeau's &quot;Heterologies&quot; (electric blue). No other books in all academia were quite so insistently chromatic, or had half as much cachet.   The tenets of scholarly fashion, like those of every other kind of fashion, derive in part from the rules of material culture; the fetish objects just happen to be books. Whatever the merits of the subject matter -- and in the case of Minnesota, they were not to be sneered at -- it is the rare academic trend that takes off without the aid of a magisterial series or a fashion-forward university press. Stanley Fish, a professor of English at Duke University, says that in the 80's Minnesota's &quot;Theory and History of Literature&quot; list -- more commonly known as the lipstick series -- &quot;was the only series for which I put a standing order, so that I would just receive whatever book came out next.&quot; In the 90's, Routledge and Verso have edged out Minnesota; you can't even think the words &quot;cultural studies&quot; without the image of their bright, matte, pop-icon-laden book covers cropping up in your head. (There is even a bookstore called Verso in Manhattan, which, though technically unaffiliated with that left-wing British press, features a cultural studies section devoted almost exclusively to Verso and Routledge books.) Among the strictly academic publishers -- Routledge and Verso are not linked to universities -- Duke University Press's shrink-wrapped books probably enclose more fetish value per pound than those of any of their competitors, since their pages are hallowed by the imprimatur of no less a personage than Stanley Fish, the press's celebrity director, and such series editors as the queer-theory superstar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and the nonfiction prose stylist Jane Kramer.">

	data-description="  IF you were a graduate student in the 80's and subject to the general delusion that held literary criticism to be the ne plus ultra of intellectual thrill, then you too probably owned one of these: an oversize paperback with an austere cover and small-type title that, grouped with three or more of its kind on your bookshelf, confirmed your status as an avatar of predoctoral chic. The object in question was a volume in the University of Minnesota series called "Theory and History of Literature" -- any volume, since they all looked alike and were each equally tantalizing, coming as they did in a wide variety of colors. There were Hans Robert Jauss's "Toward an Aesthetics of Reception" (pink), Paul de Man's "Blindness and Insight" (powder blue) and Jean-Francois Lyotard's "Postmodern Condition" (lurid aquamarine). There were Mikhail Bakhtin's "Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics" (sunflower yellow) and Michel de Certeau's "Heterologies" (electric blue). No other books in all academia were quite so insistently chromatic, or had half as much cachet.   The tenets of scholarly fashion, like those of every other kind of fashion, derive in part from the rules of material culture; the fetish objects just happen to be books. Whatever the merits of the subject matter -- and in the case of Minnesota, they were not to be sneered at -- it is the rare academic trend that takes off without the aid of a magisterial series or a fashion-forward university press. Stanley Fish, a professor of English at Duke University, says that in the 80's Minnesota's "Theory and History of Literature" list -- more commonly known as the lipstick series -- "was the only series for which I put a standing order, so that I would just receive whatever book came out next." In the 90's, Routledge and Verso have edged out Minnesota; you can't even think the words "cultural studies" without the image of their bright, matte, pop-icon-laden book covers cropping up in your head. (There is even a bookstore called Verso in Manhattan, which, though technically unaffiliated with that left-wing British press, features a cultural studies section devoted almost exclusively to Verso and Routledge books.) Among the strictly academic publishers -- Routledge and Verso are not linked to universities -- Duke University Press's shrink-wrapped books probably enclose more fetish value per pound than those of any of their competitors, since their pages are hallowed by the imprimatur of no less a personage than Stanley Fish, the press's celebrity director, and such series editors as the queer-theory superstar Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and the nonfiction prose stylist Jane Kramer."></div>

But what about the ideals of what was once quaintly called "scholarly communication"? Ever since university presses began publishing in America in the late 19th century -- in fact, ever since the first academic presses were founded in Cambridge and Oxford in 1584 and 1585, respectively -- they have had as their lofty mission the unimpeded exchange of scholarly views and findings. Scholarship was never the only thing these presses published; in the 17th century, both Cambridge and Oxford stole away from several furious London printers the much-coveted royal charter to publish the Bible, thereby insuring themselves a subsidy for all time. But such revenue-generating tricks aside -- and the American university press has its equivalent of the Bible in the form of the glossy coffeetable book on state birds and other regional reference works -- academic publishing has always considered itself the handmaiden of intellectual labor. Indeed, by the turn of the century, American academic publishers generally saw their service in the most self-effacing terms possible -- printing dissertations and Festschriften, anthologies of essays celebrating the work of some beloved but usually unknown mentor. By 1919, one pundit had already observed that "the university press was an organization whose function was to publish works which no one would read."</p><p>In 1995, however, a better observation would be that the university press is an organization whose function is to publish works plenty of people want to read -- just not enough people to warrant an entry on the global megaconglomerates' bloated balance sheets. "We're moving into a market niche that has been less and less easy for major houses to occupy," Mr. Fish says. "Now we think in terms of books that sell between 5,000 and 40,000 copies. We no longer think in terms of the nine hundred to fifteen hundred print run that was for a long time the standard among university presses." This is not the sole prerogative of the more prestigious university presses, either; the smaller ones are following the bigger ones into the wider market, whether they want to or not. "We end up publishing in fields where we think sales will be good enough," says Sanford Thatcher, director of the Pennsylvania State University Press. "One of the ironies of all this is that a field like women's studies, which is still marginalized in the academy, which is not fully accepted there, is a gold mine for publishers."</p>                </div>
