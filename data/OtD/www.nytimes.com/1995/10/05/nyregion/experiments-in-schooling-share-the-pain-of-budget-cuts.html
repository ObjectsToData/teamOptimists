But he would rather interview his own candidates to find one sympathetic to Vanguard's philosophy, as he did for the other members of his 13-teacher team. Instead, he has had to accept a teacher assigned by the central office in Brooklyn.</p><p>It's not a shared vision anymore," Mr. Delgado said. "It's awkward for everyone."</p><p>Unlike traditional schools, new academies like Vanguard were founded by groups of teachers eager to experiment. They replaced large classes with tiny ones, and strict textbook lessons and rigid curriculums with innovative courses, sometimes two hours long, that could focus on everything from the structure of bridges to Shakespeare's poetry.</p>                </div>

                    <p>To do this, the schools' founders were able to choose their own teachers through a special arrangement with the United Federation of Teachers and the Board of Education that allowed them to bypass some seniority rules on school assignments.</p><p>But in the weeks since school reopened, directors and principals at the small schools have found to their surprise that because of the budget crisis, they no  longer have the right to choose their own teachers.</p><p>"One of the central underlying concepts of the small school movement is that  school committees have individual philosophies that are not interchangeable," said Eric Nadel stern, the principal-in-residence for the Fund for New York City Public Education, which founded many of the new schools. "You cannot send in just any teacher."</p><p>While last-minute staff changes and bigger classes have hurt all schools, they are especially disruptive at the city's 75 or so smaller academies, which have fewer than 600 students each.</p><p>Last week, Mr. Delgado still did not know whether the new teacher would stay, and whether she would replace anyone already on the staff. She was one of the 1,000 teachers who started the school year without an assignment, under threat of layoff. The Board of Education and City Hall reached a financial compromise to avert layoffs, and now, officials of the United Federation of Teachers and the board are trying to place them all.</p><p>Their decisions have affected teachers like Linda Brown, a humanities teacher at Vanguard who was hired in May and spent the summer working with her new colleagues to prepare a curriculum. She was excited about teaching at Vanguard, where most classes are 80 minutes long and students routinely call teachers at home with questions about homework or projects.</p><p>But she started the year not knowing whether she would lose her job to a more senior teacher. Even though she has more than two decades of experience, she has no seniority because she left the school system for several years before returning in May.</p><p>"Everyone feels that we're pawns in this political game," she said. "We're like just so much furniture that can be moved around."</p><p>At Central Park East Secondary School, another new teacher walked in two weeks ago and told the principal, Paul Schwarz, that he had been sent to teach social studies.</p><p>Mr. Schwarz was furious. Another teacher had been carefully chosen by his hiring committee, and was already teaching humanities, an 80-minute course that  combines social studies and English.</p><p>"The new teacher asked me, 'What's humanities?' " Mr. Schwarz said. "He said  he could prepare if I just gave him the textbook. I told him, 'We don't use textbooks here.' He said, 'Show me the tests and I'll prepare from that.' I told him we don't do tests here. We have portfolios."</p><p>Last week, the new teacher transferred to another school, after Mr. Schwarz persuaded board officials that the teacher did not fit in.</p><p>Photo: Louis Delgado, the co-director of Vanguard High School, anexperimental academy on East 67th Street in Manhattan, speaking with students.
