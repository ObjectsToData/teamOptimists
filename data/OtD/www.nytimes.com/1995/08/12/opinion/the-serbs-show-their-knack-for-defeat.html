In that poem, which recalls a battle of 1389, the Serb leader, Prince Lazar, is betrayed to the Turks by one of his followers.    Yet it is not the betrayal that causes the ensuing catastrophic defeat: In the hour of decision, Prince Lazar chooses defeat because nothing is more poignant, more perfect, more heroic than death for a sacred cause. The Serbs' love affair with defeat, West argued, shaped their entire political culture.">

                    <p>It was suicidally romantic nationalism rather than canny pragmatism that led Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1990 to revoke regional autonomy for Serbia's ethnic Hungarians and Albanians. His action won Serbia nothing, but it provided crucial cover for the secession of Slovenia and Croatia from the still intact Yugoslav federation, which Serbia dominated.</p><p>The Serbs sought to recover by attacking Slovenia, but they lost.  Then they attacked Croatia, but they succeeded only in taking control of some border territory. Much of the Serb-held land in Croatia, the Krajina region, has now been lost in a spectacular but foreseeable defeat.</p><p>In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic Serbs tossed aside one chance after another to have their early gains turned into a permanent victory with great-power guarantees. The British, French and Russians were eager to award them with the larger part of the territory they had "ethnically cleansed" of its Muslim and Croat population. But the Bosnian Serbs held out for a larger victory.</p><p>Now, as their leaders turn on one another, victory is slipping away. Months ago, the fall of Bihac to the Bosnian Serbs was said to be only hours away. But that town is still in Bosnian Government hands. For three years, Serb artillery has been softening Sarajevo up for a ground assault that has yet to come. Will it ever?</p><p>Mr. Milosevic is the Prince Lazar of his day. The West was prepared to lift economic sanctions against his country and hail him as a statesman if he would but recognize Croatia and an independent remnant of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But he spurned the offers, seeking a larger victory though clandestine support of the Bosnian Serbs.</p><p>What, if not a mad romanticism, can have led Mr. Milosevic to expect the Serb 30 percent of the population to hold 70 percent of the territory indefinitely against an enemy who was increasingly well-armed and would fight on indefinitely because he had nowhere to run?</p><p>The claim that the Serbs have won in Bosnia can only stick if the major powers make it stick -- that is, if they make Croatia keep its forces outside Bosnia. The West has shown little inclination to do so. The Bosnian Serbs reportedly fear a joint Croatian-Bosnian assault on the Serb-held city of Banja Luka.</p><p>What of Sarajevo itself? Speculation about a deal between Mr. Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman -- a move that could salvage a Serb victory of sorts, has been undercut by rumors that Mr. Milosevic may be overthrown. Even if he survives and Serbs hold their Bosnian territory, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats would create a classic Balkan quagmire for the one aggressor that might have known better.</p><p>In Joseph Conrad's "Lord Jim," an English sailor abandons a sinking ship whose passengers are all Muslim pilgrims. Jim does the realistic thing. After all, the ship is sinking; surely he cannot be expected to save them all. But the ship does not sink and drifts to land, and Jim spends the rest of his life running from the memory of his disgrace.</p><p>So it may be for the West in the Balkans. In its haste to end the war, the West may have declared Bosnia-Herzegovina dead only to discover otherwise. Nothing is so irretrievably humiliating as to abandon, in the name of realism, a loser who goes on to win.</p>                </div>
