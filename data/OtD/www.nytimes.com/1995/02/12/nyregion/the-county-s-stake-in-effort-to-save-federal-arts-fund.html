Exhibitions generally open and close without incident; audiences are not known to hiss or throw eggs, and it is hard to recall any significant protest against a specific artwork.   But it would be a mistake to think that art is not a passionate pursuit here, or that artists are not hard at work in every pocket of the county. It would be just as wrong to assume that the political controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts, which has been chosen as a target for elimination by some Congressional leaders, is irrelevant to Westchester.">

                    <p>WESTCHESTER COUNTY makes art quietly. Exhibitions generally open and close without incident; audiences are not known to hiss or throw eggs, and it is hard to recall any significant protest against a specific artwork.</p><p>But it would be a mistake to think that art is not a passionate pursuit here, or that artists are not hard at work in every pocket of the county. It would be just as wrong to assume that the political controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts, which has been chosen as a target for elimination by some Congressional leaders, is irrelevant to Westchester.</p><p>On the contrary, every major cultural institution in the county has received arts endowment funds in recent years, either directly or indirectly through county or state grants, which are partly financed by the endowment.</p><p>County groups also receive funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute for Museum Services, which, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, also face huge cuts or elimination by Congress. But by far the most direct Federal support for Westchester's culture comes from the arts endowment, which last year spent $800,000 to $1 million for exhibitions, artists' fellowships and other activities.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The figure is hard to pinpoint because some grants span several years. Recipients must match the grants with other money, sometimes on a three-to-one basis. Arts leaders call endowment grants "Good Housekeeping seals of approval," because they signify to private foundations and other contributors that a group is worth supporting.</p><p>The arts endowment has come under increasing attack in recent years for financing projects like Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix in urine and Ron Athey's use of bloodied paper towels -- he is H.I.V. positive but the blood wasn't his -- in a performance work at the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis. The agency's opponents, including the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, and the majority leader, Dick Armey, want to cut out all Federal money for the arts. But the endowment's supporters say that only a small fraction of the artists who have received grants during the agency's 30-year existence may have pushed open-mindedness too far.</p><p>They say that most of the endowment's $167.4 million budget goes to the kinds of programs found in the county, where museums, orchestras, historic sites and individual artists vie for a limited number of private and public dollars.</p><p>"You have a very active county," said Katherine M. Christie, an endowment spokeswoman, discussing recent grants by phone from her Washington office. Awards last year ranged from $7,000 for a concert by the jazz trombonist Edward P. Neumeister of Croton-on-Hudson to $270,000 for the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Katonah, which will use the money to augment its own endowment.</p><p>Groups can apply for grants in several of the agency's categories at once; the Katonah Museum, for example, received $40,000 to develop an exhibition about architecture for children as well as $20,000 for a collaborative project with the Davison Art Center of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.</p><p>Some county groups are regarded as trailblazers by the arts endowment. In 1993, the Westchester Arts Council -- which in 1978 was also the first community arts council to receive a challenge grant from the endowment -- received $250,000 for Arts Excel, a program designed to teach basic elementary school subjects by using the arts. The three-year matching grant, for which the council must raise another $250,000, was one of the highest awards to a community arts council nationwide that year. Currently, 7 schools in 6 districts and 32 individual artists or groups take part in Arts Excel.</p><p>The Westchester Philharmonic, which has long received arts endowment funds for such activities as preparing new music and holding open dress rehearsals, has a $10,000 grant from the agency this year for its own education program, "Exploring New Worlds: Music of the Americas." Judy Casten, chairwoman of the orchestra's education committee, said that the grant, along with grants from Nynex and Ciba, allowed the Philharmonic to hire four specialists in ethnic music and develop a curriculum manual.</p><p>The arts endowment grant, awarded for a pilot project, also increased the number of musicians in residence the orchestra yearly sends into the schools.</p><p>At a recent daylong workshop to inaugurate the orchestra program held at Manhattanville College in Purchase, 160 teachers and administrators from 54 elementary schools in Westchester, Fairfield County and the Bronx stamped their feet to the syncopated rhythms of Aaron Flagg's jazz trumpet, clapped in accompaniment to the banjo playing of Dave Sear, a folk singer; echoed an Iroquois chant by Franc Menusan, a Cow Creek Seminole, and heard Ibrahim Gonzalez, a pianist and percussionist, discuss the origins of Latin American music.</p><p>Jeff Watson, an official in the New York division of the arts endowment, said from Washington that the orchestra's education program was a national model because it showed "a huge amount of collaboration with the school systems in planning, implementing and evaluating projects." He said such efforts were important because so many music programs are "being lost in public school systems" nationwide.</p><p>Arts endowment funds also help county groups with their behind-the-scenes operations. Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, for example, received grants in recent years to develop a walking tour around the 67-acre historic property and to conserve the painting collection of Jay Gould, the former owner.</p><p>Suzanne Pandich, Lyndhurst's director, said grants from the arts endowment, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute for Museum Services allowed "institutional excellence." Without them, she said, "the intellectual content of what we could offer the public would be diminished."</p><p>A network of agencies has helped sustain dozens of other organizations. The Westchester Arts Council and the New York State Council on the Arts, reduced by 21 percent in Gov. George E. Pataki's budget, redistribute arts endowment and other funds to a wide range of applicants.</p><p>At the Neuberger Museum of Art, Cornelia H. Butler, curator of contemporary art, said the museum was dependent on the re-granting process and on direct grants for its exhibitions and other projects.</p><p>Cherie Simon, director of public affairs for the arts endowment, said the next hearing on Senate appropriations for the agency would take place March 1. Hearings to reauthorize the arts endowment are also under way. Although the agency cannot lobby on its own behalf, Ms. Simon said many groups were sending representatives to Washington. She said it would be months before the fate of the endowment and its sister agencies is decided.</p><p>Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, said that more than money would be lost if Congress voted to drop Federal support for the arts. "Right now, government funding is a very democratic process, and everyone has a voice in the arts," she said. Losing Federal money would "put us back in the past, when art was paid for by the churches or by wealthy patrons," she continued. "The style of the art that was produced reflected who was paying for it."</p><p>Photos: Franc Menusan, a Cow Creek Seminole, plays an Iroquois water drum at a workshop.
