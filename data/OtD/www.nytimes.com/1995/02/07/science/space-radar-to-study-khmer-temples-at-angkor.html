P. Snow in the 1960's, but between two quite different sciences: archeology and the technology of remote sensing from space.</p><p>After two days of deciphering each other's arcane language, the archeologists managed to recognize how their needs could be met in part by the new technology's capabilities. The result was a plan for using space radar to advance the study of one of the world's most magnificent archeological sites, the Khmer temples of Angkor in the remote jungle of northern Cambodia.</p><p>The archeologists hope that a detailed analysis of radar pictures, taken of the Angkor region by an American space shuttle last October, will open their eyes to more ruins hidden in the jungle and will give them a better understanding of the total environment that supported this sacred and administrative capital of the Khmer civilization from the 9th through the 13th centuries. Many of the palaces, temples, moats and waterworks were constructed at the time Europe was building its great cathedrals.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"I came here mildly curious, and a little skeptical," said Dr. Elizabeth Moore, a University of London archeologist who is directing excavations at Angkor. "Now I'm quite excited. This is a new methodology. We can develop new research goals and new ways of looking at the site."</p><p>Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the imaging radar system was developed, came away from their encounter with archeologists with a greater awareness that their technology has more potential uses, and eager users, than they had originally conceived. The primary purpose of the experimental flights by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was to test the radar's ability to monitor natural and human-induced environmental changes taking place on Earth.</p><p>Dr. Diane L. Evans, chief scientist of the radar project, promised to supply the archeologists with the raw data from which the radar images were produced and advise them on how to filter and analyze the data to extract information not immediately obvious in the pictures. If a proposal for another shuttle flight with the radar is approved, she said, the needs of archeologists working at many places around the world would be carefully considered.</p><p>Until now, the application of space imaging radar to archeology has been an afterthought. "There has been sort of a language and idea barrier between the radar people and their users," said Dr. Pamela Logan, science director of the China Exploration and Research Society in Altadena, Calif., which will be using the technology to search for ruins along the legendary Silk Road in the desert of northwestern China.</p><p>The meeting, held at Princeton University, was the first formal attempt to bridge the gap between these two sciences. It was organized by the World Monuments Fund in New York City, which specializes in the conservation of architectural monuments, and the Royal Angkor Foundation of Budapest, which conducts research at the Cambodian site. The J. M. Kaplan Fund, a New York philanthropy, supported the meeting as part of its new efforts o encourage the application of new technologies to archeology.</p><p>Interest in exploring the ruins of Angkor, covering 125 square miles, has increased after an interruption of two decades caused by warfare and civil strife. Some of the temples of brick, sandstone and limestone have fallen into disrepair, some being overgrown by jungle vines. Looting has occurred, and gunfire can still be heard in the hinterlands.</p><p>The danger of land mines makes large areas inaccessible. Archeologists suspect that these areas contain evidence of settlements where the builders of the temples lived and also clues to prehistoric occupation, perhaps going back to 5000 B.C. More than 60 prehistoric mounds have already been identified, and villagers often dig up stone tools, but few of the mounds have been scientifically excavated.</p><p>The centerpiece of the conference was the blowup of a color picture, which NASA scientists had just processed from radar data gathered in a shuttle pass over Southeast Asia. Targeting Angkor had been a last-minute addition to the mission, after an official of the World Monuments Fund read a newspaper account and sent an urgent request to NASA.</p><p>Huddling around the picture, archeologists saw all the old familiar places. There was the principal temple complex, Angkor Wat, as a large green rectangle. It was surrounded by a moat in straight black lines. Dr. Moore pointed to Preah Ko, a cluster of ninth-century palaces that to her "contains evidence of the moment of change with the introduction of Indian culture" by the Khmer kings.</p><p>Dark rectangles denoted the large reservoirs that some archeologists think were reflecting pools to accentuate the temple splendors, as well as sources of water for the people and for rice cultivation. A landscape architect could make out the courses of ancient rivers, now dry, and other geological features that could be important in understanding regional development.</p><p>"Angkor is all about water," said John H. Stuffs, program director of the World Monuments Fund. "It seems to be of paramount importance to understand the old hydrological systems, if they are to be properly restored. Water in the old moats separated the outer world from those sacred precincts. And waterways were probably necessary to bring in the limestone for construction."</p><p>Some of the archeologists came to the meeting with unrealistic expectations. No, Dr. Evans said, the radar could not directly expose the presence of buried temple ruins. In deserts, the microwave signals can penetrate the arid sand to depths of 15 feet, which has revealed ancient riverbeds and apparent artifacts in the Egyptian desert. But radar does not penetrate moist soils, although surface textures and variations in vegetation recorded in the images could provide clues to where something is buried, especially if the images are analyzed in conjunction with aerial or space remote-sensing surveys in visible and infrared light.</p><p>The space imaging radar system, tested on two shuttle missions last year, transmits pulses of microwave energy in three different wavelengths toward Earth and measures the strength and time delay of the energy that is scattered back to the antenna. The returning signals can be read in ways to show the shape and nature of the surface. A composite of the data is used to produce photograph-like images of the terrain and structures on it.</p>                </div>
