They send most of their seniors off to college and, presumably, to good and prosperous lives. In many cases, people in these 20 towns choose to live where they do precisely so their children can attend the schools.   None of the 15 high schools that serve the 20 towns are large. The strong penchant of New Jersey residents for home rule, for control of what goes on within the borders of their towns, is very much in evidence here. Also strongly in evidence, in a state with the fourth most segregated school system in the country, are race and prejudice -- real or perceived -- and the law.">

                    <p>THE HIGH SCHOOLS in eastern Bergen County are all good ones. They send most of their seniors off to college and, presumably, to good and prosperous lives. In many cases, people in these 20 towns choose to live where they do precisely so their children can attend the schools.</p><p>None of the 15 high schools that serve the 20 towns are large. The strong penchant of New Jersey residents for home rule, for control of what goes on within the borders of their towns, is very much in evidence here. Also strongly in evidence, in a state with the fourth most segregated school system in the country, are race and prejudice -- real or perceived -- and the law.</p><p>At issue is a high school that is 92 percent black and Hispanic -- Dwight Morrow, in Englewood -- surrounded by largely white ones. Courts have ordered the State Board of Education to end the racial imbalance, now and forever.</p><p>Because this is about children and their education and future, people in all 20 towns have strong feelings. Many people in the towns surrounding Englewood's segregated Dwight Morrow High School are furious at any plans to redefine school districts, creating combined or new schools. Hundreds have attended town meetings, hurling angry protests at educators. While many Englewood parents favor regionalized high schools, they are equally fervent about preserving Dwight Morrow.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A decade of litigation seems to be coming to an end. The resolution will directly affect the way the region's 39,000 children are educated. It could change the way New Jersey's public school systems are formed, ushering in bigger regional high schools -- or magnet schools, with advanced courses in specialties like science or the arts -- to which children from surrounding towns would be bused. It could also be a precedent, in New Jersey and even the nation, for integrating schools in mixed communities that whites have deserted.</p><p>The lawsuits began 10 years ago with three towns and three school boards: Englewood, Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs. These last two, like most of the towns in this part of the state, are largely white, with a growing minority of Asians. Englewood Cliffs is very small and very well-off, with so few black residents they could be counted on the fingers of both hands. Tenafly is larger but almost as affluent.</p><p>The third town, Englewood, is actually a small city, with an urban range of income, race and nationality. Like the other two, it is leafy and pleasant. The average family income in the last census was $53,000, but residents range from the very wealthy -- Eddie Murphy has a house there -- to about 20 percent low-income. About half its residents are white.</p><p>Like other local high schools, Englewood's offers a full range of advanced-placement courses and electives. Its towering red-brick building is especially graceful. But unlike the town, the enrollment at Dwight Morrow is overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, up from about 60 percent as recently as the 1970's. Almost all of Englewood's white and Asian parents, including a substantial and growing population of Orthodox Jews, have simply opted out of the system, sending their children to private or parochial schools.</p><p>That is what the lawsuits are about. Englewood asserts, and the courts have agreed, that it does not matter whether schools are segregated deliberately or by happenstance. Whatever the reason, if it is at all practical, schools must be integrated.</p><p>In 1992 a state appellate court ordered a study of regionalization in the 20-town area surrounding Englewood, Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs. Regionalization, the combining of several school districts, is sometimes done for racial balance, but more often to create bigger schools with a more varied curriculum and resources.</p><p>The study, being done by Applied Data Services, a private consultant, will show different configurations of demographically varied school districts, as well as suggestions for magnet schools. It is to be given to Education Commissioner Leo F. Klagholz on July 25; he will then decide which option to accept, if any. The state has also asked Harry Galinsky, a respected former Superintendent of Schools in Paramus, to meet with residents in the 20 towns and try to come up with alternatives to involuntary regionalization.</p><p>But whatever the department's final judgment -- and it, too, will be subject to court review -- the state's aim is to resolve the segregation problem permanently, says Jay Doolan, who is overseeing the study for the Education Department.</p><p>There are people in eastern Bergen who think this study is a noble venture that would result in even finer schools that would expose students to many cultures.</p><p>"What you're doing is making history and law," said Mayor Donald Aronson of Englewood. "The evolution of this case may change the face of education in state of New Jersey. Something has to be done to change the racial imbalance in this community."</p><p>And there are people who see the study as an attempt to wreck lovingly tended neighborhood schools, schools that offer "a wonderful sense of stability in a volatile world," as one Tenafly parent put it.</p>                </div>
