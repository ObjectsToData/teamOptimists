Post-deconstructionism   , which I will define in due course, is coined on the analogy of    post-modernism   , the label that architects and decorative artists put on their complex and classic shapes evocative of historical periods, as they rejected the stark International style of the first half of the 20th century, with its Cubist art and wasteland poetry and 12-tone music suitable for the elevators of the World Trade Center buildings.

That dated adjective came into English in 1585, from the Latin    modo   , "just now," and became a popular synonym for    contemporary    or    up-to-date   ; the term    Modern English    covers the development of our language since roughly the mid-15th century. As a style, however,    modern    seems passe. The current exhibit at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art in New York is "What Modern Was," a look at design from 1935 to 1965.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Paul Goldberger, cultural news editor of The New York Times, thinks modernism may never have died, and tells me that the current trend -- less dogmatic and rationalist than modernism -- might be called    Late Modernism   , or    Romantic Modernism   , or even (for those who like oxymorons)    Romantic Pragmatism   .</p><p>These terms have more of what deconstructionists call    jouissance    than the other candidates for architect-designer nomenclature like    New Romanticism    or    New Historicism    (terms also used by literary critics and historians). My vote is for    Romantic Modernism    because it can be shortened in headlines as    Ro-Mo   , on the analogy of    lit-crit    for "literary criticism."</p><p>Whether it's the catchy    Ro-Mo    or some dreary monicker like    double-post-modernism   , the new label will be featured in those timetable-of-history books in the years running up to the third millennium alongside Cold War II.</p><p>Leap from "decorative arts" over to the politic arts: for a few weeks, the corresponding political era was called    post-cold-war   , a posting that turned out to be premature.    The Second Cold War   , or    Cold War II   , was coined by Richard J. Whalen as a chapter title in his 1974 book, "Taking Sides." This parallel to World Wars I and II did not take hold until recently, when a chinpull of pundits began to use it. Now it bids fair to challenge the New World Order, which could be the name of an era to come if the    Second Cold War    turns out to be the brief interlude between Gorbachev and Yeltsin.</p><p>Now leap from politics to the humanities, where    modernism    has also been posted. This world of linguistics, semiotics and literature likes to quote Ludwig Wittgenstein sighing, "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." The high life of the mind in this world was roiled in the 70's and 80's by the rise of    deconstructionism   , which we will henceforth call    decon    because it is suitably irreverent. Although the word has a root in the existentialist philosopher Martin Heidegger's use of the word    Destruktion   , it does not mean "destruction" so much as "detailed disassembly."</p><p>This is the philosophy that makes the reader more important than the author, placing the interpretation higher than the text. That word    text    is central; in the old days, a flesh-and-blood author created a    work   ; nowadays, a critic studies a stand-alone    text   .</p><p>Decon is a way of analyzing literature by denying the traditional meanings of words, breaking their link with real things and insisting that they have significance only in relation to other words or signs. Author's intent, agreed-upon meanings of words, historic or cultural settings all go by the board. (I started to write    by the boards   , but that mistakenly points to the plural    boards    of a theater. The singular    board    has been used for the past millennium as a nautical term meaning "the side of a ship," as in the right-sided    starboard   . Since 1630, the seagoing    by the board    has been used to indicate loss or disappearance.)</p><p>In decon, only the interaction between the text and the critical reader counts. This delights the regimented legions of professional iconoclasts, but upsets communicators who like to fix meanings with some precision; it also infuriates academics who don't want to join a club with no clubhouse. Some decon, particularly in biblical exegesis, has revealed meanings in scripture heretofore unknown, and the questioning of long-held interpretation is refreshing, but the kick in the philosophy is more in taking apart than in putting back together.    Annihilate    and    nihilism    have the same root.</p><p>Today's heavy lifting is occasioned by the reading of the most lucid and controversial lit-crit book of the year, "Signs of the Times" by David Lehman. The author is a poet and critic (and, incidentally, a precinct captain in the Poetic Allusion Watchers division of the Lexicographic Irregulars).</p><p>Mr. Lehman derides Jacques Derrida, French founder of the movement; he zaps Roland Barthes, author of "The Death of the Author," and really gives a hard time to the late Paul de Man, high priest of the decon school in the United States, a temperate and beloved Yale professor who, it was recently discovered, happened to have embraced the tenets of Nazism in his youth in Belgium.</p><p>Everybody in this dodge doubleplays around; for both decons and their opponents, the pun is mightier than the word. Prof. Geoffrey Hartman calls his hard-squeezing colleagues "boa-deconstructors" and the surreal philosophy "Derridadaism"; Mr. Lehman subtitles his book "Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man," playing on the fall of Man, and labels the past-forgetfulness of his subject "Waldheimer's disease."</p><p>The name of the decon game is that the game's name means something different every time. That language philosophy is provocative, but it goes nowhere and cries out for a more satisfying theory to refute it. How can I be Saussure? Because the pressure that many of us in the language dodge get from average users is not "free us from rigid meaning" but "give us moorings"; Norma Loquendi is discontent with explanations that words can be ambivalent (and is of two minds about my using    ambivalent   ).</p><p>That's why we are certain to see the rise of    post-deconstructionism   . That word assumes that decon will be remembered as important enough to rate a    post   , as    modernism    was. I think it will; some of its terminology resonates. (You cannot write anything on this subject without using the vogue verbs    roil    and    resonate   , and citing Wittgenstein and Ferdinand de Saussure.)</p><p>Take    jouissance   , for example: the common meaning is "sexual ecstasy," but Roland Barthes uses it to mean "the pleasure of the text." That sure beats    a good read   .</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
