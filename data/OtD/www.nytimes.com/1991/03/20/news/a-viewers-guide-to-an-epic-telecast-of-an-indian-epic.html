    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Now that pledge week is over, just when you thought it was safe to watch public television again, &quot;Great Performances&quot; is bringing a six-hour, three-evening cultural extravaganza to the screens of the unsuspecting. &quot;The Mahabharata,&quot; Peter Brook's retelling of the classic Indian narrative poem, will be broadcast in three two-hour segments, beginning at 9 o'clock, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.    Viewers should be forewarned that they have precious little time left to prepare for this event. The saga presents nothing less ambitious than the Hindu story of mankind; its plot has the degree of difficulty of Shakespeare's history plays, and it shines with a spiritual significance akin to that of the Bible. The epic is important to Hindu history, religion and thought. And like the Bible and the Bard, it weaves some juicy tales of higher deities and heroes, of love, war, murder, madness, greed, rape and incest.">

Viewers should be forewarned that they have precious little time left to prepare for this event. The saga presents nothing less ambitious than the Hindu story of mankind; its plot has the degree of difficulty of Shakespeare's history plays, and it shines with a spiritual significance akin to that of the Bible. The epic is important to Hindu history, religion and thought. And like the Bible and the Bard, it weaves some juicy tales of higher deities and heroes, of love, war, murder, madness, greed, rape and incest."></div>

And like the Bible and the Bard, it weaves some juicy tales of higher deities and heroes, of love, war, murder, madness, greed, rape and incest.</p><p>Newcomers to "The Mahabharata" may need help in coping with this event; in fact, they might benefit from a Cliffs Notes version of the epic. Cliffs Notes, of course, are those popular little study guides with the yellow-and-black covers emblazoned with the reassuring motto, "Your Key to the Classics."</p><p>Herewith, then, a skeleton key to "The Mahabharata." The information was furnished by Dr. Barbara Stoler Miller, Milbank Professor of Humanities at Barnard College in Manhattan. A translator of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad Gita," she was the scholarly consultant to the production.</p>                </div>

                    <p>THE TITLE: " 'Maha' means 'great,' " said Dr. Miller, "and Bharata was the legendary first King of India." The characters in the epic, she said, "are all descendants of the Bharatas." The second syllable of "Mahabharata" is extended slightly, and the accent is on the third syllable, so that it is pronounced "mah-haah-BAR-ah-tah."</p><p>THE SOURCE: "The Mahabharata" is rooted in tales of a tribal war fought in northern India at the beginning of the first millennium B.C. ("The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" date from roughly the same era.) But the length of "The Mahabharata" -- 100,000 couplets -- is 10 times that of "The Odyssey" and "The Iliad" combined. The earliest surviving written versions of "The Mahabharata" are about a thousand years old.</p><p>THE DIRECTOR: Mr. Brook is the Paris-based, London-born superdirector whose most recent splashes were "The Tragedy of Carmen" and "The Cherry Orchard." His nine-hour theatrical version of "The Mahabharata" challenged audience endurance in 1987 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p><p>THE TEXT: The epic, in its entirety, requires as much as a year in the telling, so six hours on public television is nowhere near the imposition it could have been.</p><p>Part 1, "The Game of Dice," introduces the five sons of King Pandu. Half god, and half human, they are collectively called the Pandavas. Subsequently they lose the throne to their cousins, the hundred sons of Pandu's regent, who are called, collectively, the Kauravas.</p><p>Part 2, "Exile in the Forest," follows the 13-year exile of the Pandavas, while the Kauravas live uneasily in the palace.</p><p>In Part 3, "The War," the titanic battle for the throne between the Pandavas and the Kauravas unfolds in a way that parallels the mayhem of the Trojan War.</p><p>THE CHARACTERS: If you managed to follow the Bezukhovs, the Kuragins, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs and the Drubetskoys in "War and Peace," you should be able to sort out the cast of "The Mahabharata." Viewers are advised to keep track of Vyasa, the narrator, and to follow the animadversions of Krishna, the earthly incarnation -- or avatar -- of the god Vishnu; he is both human and divine, an enigmatic guide as well as a trickster.</p><p>Another key player is Bhishma -- whom the epic presents as the perfect man -- who is given the right to choose the day of his death in return for his vow of lifelong celibacy.</p><p>The Pandavas include Arjuna, the clan's truest hero and finest archer; Bhima (not to be confused with Bhishma), the strongest man in the world, and Draupadi, the fiery wife of all five of the Pandavas (don't ask why; it's a long story) who gives each of them a son.</p><p>Among the Kauravas are Karna, the great warrior who is the only match for Arjuna; and Duryodhana, who passionately seeks to rule the earth.</p><p>THE PHILOSOPHY: "The Mahabharata" has, according to Dr. Miller, inspired and instructed the people of Asia for thousands of years, deeply influencing their religious and cultural life.</p><p>The interweaving of the family saga of the Bharatas with the urgent mysteries of cosmic concerns "is a distinctive feature of 'The Mahabharata,' " said Dr. Miller. Among the drama's preoccupations are the mystery of life and death, the nature of illusion and reality, and the struggle to achieve the good, or "dharma," in the conflict between order and chaos. The saga ends in the cataclysmic destruction of the world, and its ultimate regeneration.</p><p>"Dharma" is embodied in the drama's epic heroes, who commit acts of sacrifice, penance and spiritual victory over evil. At one point in the narrative, while preparing for battle, the warrior Arjuna is fortified by a divine discourse with the god Krishna, who offers a tutorial on the nature of disciplined action in dealing with the reality of life and death in the world.</p><p>That discourse is, in fact, the "Bhagavad Gita," the mystical teaching that has inspired, among others, Gandhi, Emerson and Thoreau.</p><p>ACADEMIC DISCLAIMER: As every Cliffs Notes guide lectures the lazy scholar, "These notes are not a substitute for the work itself."</p><p>"The Mahabharata" is no exception. Having digested this skeleton key, readers are now honor-bound to experience the production. Afterward, viewers should hold themselves in a maximum state of readiness for short-answer tests, pop quizzes and multiple essay questions without advance notice.</p><p>Photo: Mallika Sarabhai in a scene from "The Mahabharata," to be broadcast in three two-hour segments on PBS beginning on Monday at 9 P.M.
