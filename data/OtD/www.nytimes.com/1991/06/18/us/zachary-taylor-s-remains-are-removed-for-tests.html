Test results are expected in about two weeks.</p><p>Taylor's remains, the first of any President's to be exhumed, were returned to the crypt in the cemetery later in the day, said Richard Greathouse, the Coroner of Jefferson County.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Died on July 9, 1850</p><p>Clara Rising, a former humanities professor at the University of Florida, requested the tests to settle a smoldering doubt among some historians that Taylor died of natural causes on July 9, 1850.</p><p>"The suspicions are really in the history books," she said, standing near the crypt. "Right after his death, everything he had worked against came forward and was passed by both houses of Congress."</p><p>While most historians have accepted Taylor's death as natural, Dr. Rising said the suddenness of his illness on July 4 was suspicious for a man whose health was widely known to be robust.</p><p>Politically, Dr. Rising added, the crisis of 1850, in which secessionist fervor was reaching a breaking point, created circumstances for pro-slavery factions that desperately wanted to silence Taylor, a Southerner who opposed the extension of slavery and who wanted to bring California and New Mexico into the Union as free states.</p><p>Had he lived, Taylor would have vetoed the Fugitive Slave Act and the Compromise of 1850, two measures that ultimately stirred passions between the North and the South, said Dr. Rising, who is conducting research for a book about Taylor. "This man may have, if not prevented it, delayed or some how solved the poblems that caused the Civil War," she said. 'Brought It Home to Me'</p><p>The hermetically sealed coffin still bore remnants of silver cords and blue braiding that decorated it at Taylor's funeral in Washington in July 1850, said Louise LeBourgeois, who watched as the coffin was removed and who identified herself as a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Taylor.</p><p>"Being a descendant of a dead President is not something I think about every day of my life," said Ms. LeBourgeois, a 27-year-old paralegal and artist who lives in Chicago. "But actually seeing the casket there, it really brought it home to me."</p><p>Other distant relatives, who stood by as the lid of the Tennessee marble vault was opened to reveal the coffin, said they were struck by the musty smell of the crypt and the difficulty several men had in lifting the coffin.</p><p>Originally, only small samples of hair, fingernails and bones were going to be removed from the crypt, Dr. Greathouse said. But in the crypt it was decided that the entire coffin needed to be taken to the coroner's office where it could be carefully opened, because its wood was badly decomposing.</p><p>The coffin turned out to be black walnut with a badly deteriorated lead liner, said Ben Underwood, president of Nuerath &amp; Underwood, the funeral home that placed Taylor in the crypt. Entombed With His Wife</p><p>Most people at the site spoke in a respectful hush as they craned their necks for a view into the simple limestone mausoleum in which Taylor and his wife, Margaret, who died in 1852, were entombed. But for more than an hour, little could be seen except for a group of pathologists and cemetery workers and Taylor family members who milled in and out of the crypt, which is shaded by a stand of crab apple trees. A green curtain hung across the cypt's double-door entrance.</p><p>Dr. Greathouse said he and other experts would test the remains for toxic levels of arsenic and other heavy-metal poisons. Arsenic, commonly available in the 19th century as rat poison, can remain in the body's tissues and boney materials for centuries, he said.</p><p>Dr. Greathouse said he and other experts had expected the coffin to be made of cast iron and sealed with bolts. The coffin, decorated with eight brass handles and cherubs, was so badly deteriorated that it was placed within a protective pouch before it could be moved.</p><p>The coffin was also extremely difficult to open. Attempts to break its seal with a torch failed, said the State Chief Medical Examiner, George Nichols. A power saw was used to get inside the coffin to reveal the mostly skeletal remains, said William Maples, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Florida who is assisting Dr. Greathouse.</p><p>"I think we are very pleased with what we got," Dr. Greathouse said. "I think we got some reasonable samples."</p><p>Dr. Nichols added that there were enough samples, mostly hair, fingernails and some bone, and that they were in fair enough condition to determine whether the President was killed with a heavy-metal poison like arsenic.</p><p>The test results, including a second set done by another laboratory, should be known in about two weeks, he said.</p><p>Dr. Greathouse, who said he has investigated several arsenic homicides in Kentucky, said descriptions of Taylor's sudden illness and death were consistent with the symptoms of arsenic poisoning.</p><p>"He died rather suddenly after eating a meal at the White House," he said. "And then having somewhat an acute, explosive gastrointestinal disorder, which is compatible with acute arsenic poisoning."</p><p>It takes about 125 milligrams of arsenic, a tasteless and odorless substance, to "tear up your intestinal tract," Dr. Greathouse said.</p><p>Earlier, some pathologists cautioned Dr. Greathouse and his team to be careful not to confuse possible traces of arsenic that might have leaked into the body tissues from embalming fluid that often contained arsenic as a preservative in the 1800's.</p><p>Photo: The remains of Zachary Taylor being wheeled yesterday from a crypt in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, Ky.
