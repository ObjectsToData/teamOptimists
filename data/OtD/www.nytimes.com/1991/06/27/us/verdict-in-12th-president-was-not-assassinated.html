Taylor's death was caused by any of &quot;a myriad of natural diseases which could have produced the symptoms of gastroenteritis,&quot; said George R. Nichols 2d, the State Chief Medical Examiner, adding that because of severe decomposition of the body, a precise cause of death could not be determined.">

                    <p>Tests conducted here and at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge,Tenn., did discover traces of the common heavy metal in hair, bone and dried fleshy tissues from Taylor's remains that were taken from his crypt on June 17.</p><p>The arsenic levels,though, appear to be naturally occurring and far too low to be considered lethal, Dr. Nichols saidat a news conference in the Jefferson County Courthouse.</p><p>He said levels of arsenic found in Taylor's remains would have had to be 200 to thousands of times greater than it was in order for the heavy metal to have killed him on July 9, 1850, at the age of 65.</p><p>Although there had been some concern that arsenic, commonly used during that period in embalming fluids, could contaminate the tests, Dr. Greathouse said Taylor's body had never been embalmed. An Assassination Theory</p><p>For months Clara Rising, a novelist and former humanities professor, had raised a theory that Taylor had been assassinated, poisoned with arsenic. She presented her suspicions to Dr. Greathouse, who said her request to remove Taylor's remains was "reasonable."</p><p>Dr. Greathouse said descriptions of Taylor's violent intestinal disorder after he ate a bowl of iced cherries and iced milk on July 4, 1850, seemed consistent with the symptoms of arsenic poisoning. Dr. Greathouse said he investigated the case as if it was any other possible homicide in his county.</p><p>Before removing Taylor's remains, Dr. Greathouse had to get permission for entering the crypt from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which administers the Zachary TaylorNational Cemetery in which the Taylor and his wife, Margaret, are entombed. Remains Removed 8 Days Ago</p><p>Taylor's body was returned to his crypt about five hours after it was removed eight days ago.</p><p>As for what will happen to the samples of mostly hair and shredded finger and toe nails taken from Taylor's remains, that decision will be left to the family, Dr. Nichols said.</p><p>Dr. Rising, who is conducting research for a book about Taylor, had offered to pay for the exhumation, whose cost was estimated at $1,200. But Dr. Nichols said today that the testing would fall under his normal duties.</p><p>Despite the Medical Examiner's findings, Dr. Rising said the investigation into Taylor's death had been worth the effort.</p><p>For months, she had maintained that pro-slavery factions troubled by Taylor's attempts to containslavery could have given his political foes with a powerful motive to assassinate him.</p><p>While most historians have accepted Taylor's death as natural, Dr. Rising said the suddenness of his illness was suspicious for a man whose health was widely known to have been robust. With secessionist fervor reaching a breaking point in 1850, pro-slavery factions desperately wanted to silence Taylor, a Southerner who opposed the extension of slavery and who wanted to bring California and New Mexico into the Union as free states. How History Might Have Changed</p><p>"We found the truth," Ms. Rising said in a phone interview from her home in Holder, Fla. "The truth also contains the fact that his political enemies benefited from his removal, whether they removed him or not. You can still point the finger and say they got away with it even if nature did him in."</p><p>She added: "It would seem that if you're studying a man whose Administration and actions indicated that he possibly could have put this country into a different direction, away from the Civil War, then it was worth it. Certainly, the 628,000 battlefield dead would say it was worth looking into."</p><p>Helene Rufty, a 29-year-old great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Taylor's said she was relieved about findings.</p><p>"The good thing about it is that history has been brought to life," she said. "At least it has for the family, and I hope for so many people across the nation."</p><p>Photos: Dr. George R. Nichols 2d, above, Kentucky's Chief Medical Examiner, said tests showed that Zachary Taylor had died of natural causes and was not poisoned.
