Kamman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European affairs, to the Baltics to carry out the announcement and he is expected to arrive in Lithuania later this week.

                    <p>A senior Administration official who insisted on not being identified said that unless Lithuania moved swiftly to clear up the exoneration issue and retract certificates issued to people clearly convicted of war crimes, its government would face "a terrible credibility problem."</p><p>The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations is pursuing the cases of several Lithuanians suspected of war crimes and it is seeking the assistance of the State Department in pressing the new Lithuanian Government to cooperate.</p><p>Of the Lithuanian Government, Mr. Boucher said, "We would expect that they would be acting in accordance" with an exoneration law passed by the Lithuanian Parliament in May 1990, which excludes people guilty of genocide or murdering civilians.</p><p>Jewish organizations assert that several convicted mass murderers were recently issued certificates of exoneration in Lithuania.</p><p>In an interview on Tuesday, the Lithuanian chief prosecutor, Artusas Paulauskas, said his Government had been issuing certificates proclaiming the innocence of Lithuanians convicted by Soviet authorities without new investigation of the cases.</p><p>Mr. Boucher said: "It is our understanding that the Lithuanian law of last year that annulled illegitimate convictions by Soviet authorities also specifically excluded genoicde and the murder of civilians. Obviously our concerns about the crimes that were committed in World War II have been amply expressed by our actions over the past 50 years."</p><p>The Administration wanted more information from the Lithuanians since it was "something that we do feel strongly about," the spokesman said.</p><p>Asta Banionis, director of government affairs of the Lithuanian-American Community, said her organization, based in Arlington, Va., had sent an inquiry today to the Government in Vilnius asking for a clarification on the exoneration program. Letter From Wiesel</p><p>"We as Americans read with great dismay and in fact outrage the story in The New York Times today," Ms. Banionis said. "If the facts are correct, the Prosecutor General of Lithuania in our opinion has not been implementing the laws of the democratically elected Parliament of Lithuania."</p><p>Elie Wiesel, the survivor of Nazi death camps who was awarded the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize, said in a letter addressed today to Vytautas Landsbergis, President of Lithuania, that the disclosure of "your Government's decision to rehabilitate war criminals" had left him with "a sense of disappointment and deception and outrage."</p><p>From his office at Boston University, where he is a professor of humanities, Mr. Wiesel wrote of those Lithuanians who have apparently been exonerated: "Many of them have committed murder, assassinating men, women and children only because they were Jewish. To rehabilitate them today means to forgive them. That this would be among the first steps of an independent Lithuania is something no decent person can understand or accept."                    --------------------       2 Exonerations Reviewed</p><p>VILNIUS, Lithuania, Sept. 5 (AP) -- Following an outcry from Jewish groups that Lithuania was exonerating Nazi war criminals, the Government agreed today to review two of the thousands of exonerations.</p><p>A Lithuanian prosecutor, Vidmantas Vaicekauskas, denied that his newly independent republic had deliberately cleared Nazi war criminals, but acknowledged that some may have been inadvertently cleared.</p><p>"It was possible that some would slip through," said Mr. Vaicekauskas, who is in charge of the exonerations. But he insisted that the overwhelming majority of the certificates granted so far were valid.</p><p>The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center has submitted a list of 13 people it says were cleared even though they took part in the killing of Jews between 1941 and 1944, when Lithuania was occupied by invading forces from Nazi Germany.</p><p>"As far as the survivors of the Holocaust all over the world, they'd be absolutely horrified by this news," said Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Weisenthal Center.</p><p>Mr. Vaicekauskas said he agreed to re-examine two cases, even though Lithuanian investigators had determined the Soviet charges against them were false. He said he could find no information in his files on the other 11 names provided by the American group.</p><p>Mr. Vaicekauskas displayed a July 17 letter from Ephraim Zuroff, head of the Israeli branch of the Weisenthal Center, naming the 13</p><p>Rabbi Hier said at least half of the group is alive.</p>                </div>
