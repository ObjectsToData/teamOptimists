                    <p>For many people, Jersey City may just be the punch line of a thousand jokes, a community to pass through, not to live in. Such images can be destructive and self-defeating, a reality Mr. Waddleton has seen firsthand as a drug counselor at Ferris High School in Jersey City. He said a local Hall of Fame celebrating the accomplishments of Jersey City residents of the past could give today's children a future to believe in.</p><p>"Kids need something like that today," said Mr. Waddleton, a lifelong resident of Jersey City.</p><p>Mr. Fine has the kind of ragged- edged voice that belongs behind a microphone during a high school basketball game, where enthusiasm can explode into excitement at a dribble's notice. He went before the Jersey City Council three times to plead his case, but despite his persuasive arguments, the Council thought the estimated cost, $800,000, was too high.</p><p>Eventually a compromise was reached, and the Council gave Mr. Fine seed money of $50,000 with which to start the project and raise the rest of the money.</p><p>Working out of an office next door to the A. &amp; P. on Palisade Avenue in the Heights section of Jersey City, Mr. Fine is trying to pull the project together. He has already decided that there will be four general categories in the Hall of Fame: business, entertainment, arts and humanities and, of course, sports.</p><p>Some names are shoo-ins, Mr. Fine said. Last month, he organized a fund raiser at a Jersey City waterfront restaurant and invited Jim Spanarkle, a former Duke University standout and National Basketball Association player, to speak. He also had a plaque engraved with Mr. Spanarkle's likeness and presented it to him as the first unofficial inductee into the Jersey City Hall of Fame.</p><p>Mr. Fine bought 19 other plaques and hopes to induct five people from each category this year. He now has an advisory committee to help him.</p><p>He has already done some research, looking through old newspaper clips and talking to city residents to come up with his own list. It is stronger in sports than any other category, but that's not surprising, considering his bent. He has Ed Franco, one of the seven blocks of granite of Fordham University's football teams, and Johnny Kucks, winning pitcher of the seventh game of the 1956 World Series between the Yankees and the Dodgers.</p><p>Mr. Fine is not sure whether Ozzie Nelson (from the "Ozzie and Harriet" television show of the 1950's) belongs in sports or entertainment. "He was a football coach at Dickinson High; they called him Honey Boy," Mr. Fine said. "Mayor McCann told me that, but I haven't confirmed it through definitive research yet."</p><p>In the business field he has Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League, and Samuel C. DiFeo, whose network of 41 car dealerships ranks as the 14th largest family-owned business in the nation.</p><p>"And he opened the first car dealership in Russia," Mr. Fine said.</p><p>Entertainment was fairly easy, Mr. Fine said. There are Flip Wilson, Valerie Harper, Jerome Robbins and the pop music group Kool and the Gang. Arts and humanities was a bit more difficult, partly because, he said, it's not his field. But he has found Mary Norton, one of the first women in Congress, and Dr. Lena Williams, a prominent physician from the 1940's.</p><p>But Mr. Fine's list so far skips over what may be Jersey City's greatest contribution to New Jersey culture: the Jersey City pol -- the legendary Democratic political bosses, crooked local politicans and inept but colorful local officials whose pranks have earned a special place in the history of not only Jersey City but also the entire state.  Mr. Fine deliberately left politicians off the initial list because, he said, even though they are dead, their alliances and feuds can turn knuckles white.</p><p>"I don't say I don't want to do it; I'm just starting slow," Mr. Fine said, weighing his words as carefully as any Jersey City natives would when talking about the dead, especially someone they once voted for. "I'm fully aware of the city's unique political heritage and I fully intend to integrate it into the Hall of Fame, but I'm doing it carefully."</p><p>There's no question that deciding which old pols to put into a Hall of Fame and which to leave out is tricky, especially if the City Council is footing the bill. But interviews with Jersey City natives reveal a great willingness to nominate political leaders and other notorious citizens of the second largest and perhaps most characteristic city in New Jersey.</p><p>Frank Hague ("I am the law") would, of course, have to be on the list. The personification of a political boss, Hague ruled the city with a mink-lined iron hand. His wheeling and dealing reached into the White House, yet, on opening day for the city's minor league baseball team, the Jersey Giants, Hague closed the schools and distributed free tickets.</p><p>Another might be John V. Kenny, the "little guy" who bucked the Hague machine and then installed himself at the head of the next political dynasty. Kenny was a Zelig-like character who for decades could be spotted in countless newspaper photographs of wedding couples, ordinations and funerals.</p><p>Yet another was Joseph (Newsboy) Moriarity, who identified himself as a news dealer on his income tax forms but was a loyal Democrat heavily into the mob. While Moriarity was serving time in jail for trying to run down Federal agents with his car, workmen cleaning out a garage on the West Side of town found millions of dollars in the trunk of an old car traced back to Moriarity.</p><p>T. James Tumulty, a 300-pound deputy mayor who could intimidate people with his razor-sharp wit, might be considered. Before he became a city official, he was an outspoken critic who once was asked by Mayor Hague why he always opposed the city budget. "Because I'm not in it, your honor," he said.</p><p>And then there was Barney Doyle, a Hudson County superintendent of weights and measures. It was well known in Jersey City that his qualifications for the job were his political pedigree, not any academic degree. After Mr. Doyle's swearing-in, a local reporter asked him how many ounces were in a pound.</p><p>"Aw, fellas, give me a break," Mr. Doyle said. "I just got the job."</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
