    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  As she recalled it, the evening of March 1, 1990, a Thursday, began ordinarily enough: the St. John's University student took target practice with another member of the school's rifle club and bantered with him and the coach about everything from the coach's shabby clothing to the other student's love life.    But when the evening ended about seven hours later, as the 22-year-old woman later testified, she had been &quot;forced&quot; to drink nearly three cups of a mixture of orange soda and vodka and had been disrobed, ogled, fondled, berated and sodomized by at least seven St. John's students, including her acquaintance from the rifle club. The debauchery began in a house near the Jamaica, Queens, campus; then she was transported, semi-conscious and disheveled, to a second house where a party was underway and the assault continued.">

But when the evening ended about seven hours later, as the 22-year-old woman later testified, she had been "forced" to drink nearly three cups of a mixture of orange soda and vodka and had been disrobed, ogled, fondled, berated and sodomized by at least seven St. John's students, including her acquaintance from the rifle club. The debauchery began in a house near the Jamaica, Queens, campus; then she was transported, semi-conscious and disheveled, to a second house where a party was underway and the assault continued."></div>

One asked, "What if she talks?" Another replied: "So what? Remember Tawana Brawley? Nobody believed her. Nobody will believe this one."</p><p>Some 16 months later, that is indeed the question that lingers in the Queens courtroom where for nearly two months a jury has been hearing the woman's account, told in snippets by three St. John's students who say they took part in the assault, university officials, police officers, a rape-trauma expert and the woman herself.</p>                </div>

                    <p>When prosecutors rest their case early next week, will they have convinced the jury that an intelligent but naive young woman was lured into that house by a man she knew and then forced into sexual activity?</p><p>Or will the jurors believe what two defense lawyers have tried to show through aggressive cross-examinations: that the woman willingly participated in a night of wild sex with a group of men and, some days later, concocted her story of a criminal assault?  20% of College Women Assaulted</p><p>That question -- whom to believe among young people who knew one another about events whose circumstances are often murky -- is at the heart as well of stories being told with greater frequency on campuses stretching from New Hampshire to California.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that 20 percent to 25 percent of college women have been victims of sexual assaults and that the overwhelming majority of those incidents involved the consumption of alcohol or drugs by the victim, the attacker or both. It is estimated that well over half the sexual assaults reported to the authorities each year are committed by someone the victims knew. Indeed the term date rape has become part of the national discourse, in large part because of a Palm Beach, Fla., case in which a woman has accused William Kennedy Smith, a nephew of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, of raping her after they met in a nightclub and she went home with him.</p><p>What is unusual about the St. John's case is that it has come to trial. About 90 percent of sexual assault cases involving people who know each other are never reported, according to social scientists who study the phenomenon. 'Victims Blame Themselves'</p><p>"A lot of victims blame themselves," said Andrea Parrott, a Cornell University psychologist who is studying sexual assaults on 25 New York campuses and whose book, "Acquaintance Rape: The Hidden Crime," was published earlier this year.</p><p>"They say, 'Gee, I shouldn't have been drunk,' 'I shouldn't have gone back to his apartment,' 'I know this is a horrible thing but I brought it on myself' and so they don't report it," Professor Parrott said.</p><p>Another disincentive is the fear of disbelief. The women's stories are frequently met with skepticism by their family members and closest friends, said Linda Fairstein, the chief of the sex crimes bureau in the Manhattan District Attorney's office.</p><p>"It is in acquaintance cases that the victim is most commonly stigmatized by her peers and the people who should be her support system," Ms. Fairstein said. "There is much more of a tendency to blame the victim." Praise and Condemnation</p><p>So in some quarters the woman in the St. John's case has been applauded for coming forward, for persevering during months of investigations and pretrial proceedings, and for withstanding five grueling days on the witness stand last month -- four of them with harsh questioning by the lawyers for the three men on trial.</p><p>But along with the praise has come condemnation and skepticism about her story, about whether she could have been such "a trusting and innocent soul," as the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, an adviser to the woman, describes her.</p><p>People who find such stories incredible "don't know very much about date rape or acquaintance rape or about college and campus life," said Barbara Smith, an author and publisher who founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.</p><p>"This kind of thing does happen all the time," said Ms. Smith. Citing several cases, she said, "Rather than talking about how naive the young woman was, we should be talking about how bestial the young men were to think they could treat a human being in this fashion and get away with it."
