Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses, its population soared by 41.2 percent and developers recently sued the town successfully for the right to build 3,400 high-density housing units in the sparsely populated southern section, which will almost double the township's current 4,000 housing units.   &quot;The recession has held them up,&quot; said Mayor Lorraine Kulick, &quot;but when these projects come in, they will change the whole township. When I moved in 27 years ago, the old-time residents didn't like the new developments. Now, even two-year residents say, 'Stop development.' &quot;">

"</p><p>Besides slowing the pace of building, the recession also has depressed housing prices, with some down by 30 percent, said Linda Trott, president of ERA-Trott Realty on Route 9.</p><p>Most one-family houses have four bedrooms and are on a third to half an acre, she said. Prices range upward from about $170,000 for some 1,800-square-foot, four-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath houses on Old Queens Boulevard or Kipling Way in the northwestern section of town. At the $650,000 level are five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot center-hall colonials on two acres on Stonebridge Court and Shira Lane at the southern end of town.</p>                </div>

                    <p>One of the larger developments is the 25-year-old, 685-home Monmouth Heights off Route 9. Deeds obligate buyers to join the Monmouth Heights Community Association, which maintains an olympic-sized swimming pool, a kiddy pool, two tennis courts and a volleyball court on Ryan Road. Annual association dues are $185.</p><p>Three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath colonials and ranches in Monmouth Heights are priced from $185,000 to $200,000. Four-bedroom houses are $15,000 to $25,000 more.</p><p>The Covered Bridge retirement community off Route 9 has 1,831 one- and two-bedroom condominium apartments. To buy there, at least one spouse must be 62 or older. One-bedroom units sell for $50,000 to $55,000; two bedrooms go for about $58,000, with ranch-style end units fetching up to about $115,000.</p><p>The two other major condominium developments are Oak Knolls, off Longwood Drive, and Southfield, off Symmes Road. There are 266 completed units in Oak Knolls, which eventually will have 330. New units range from $110,000 for a two-bedroom town house with no basement to $130,000 for some three-bedrooms with basements. Resales go for $115,000 to $125,000 for two-bedrooms and about $10,000 more for three-bedrooms. Prices at Southfield start at $130,000 for two-bedrooms and go to $150,000 for some three-bedroom town houses.</p><p>MRS. TROTT said it is hard to find rentals in Manalapan. Covered Bridge condominiums rent for $600 to $650 for one bedroom and $700 to $750 for two. Oak Knolls condominiums rent for $900 to $950 for two bedrooms and about $50 more for three.</p><p>Howard P. and Pamela K. Dorman moved to the Monmouth County township in 1986. Like many others, they did so to escape the congestion of northern New Jersey.</p><p>"We lived in an apartment in Teaneck and were looking to expand our family," said Mr. Dorman. "We had cousins and friends in Manalapan and found that the properties were larger and the housing more affordable."</p><p>They bought a four-bedroom colonial on Saupe Drive for $250,000. Mr. Dorman says their boys, Neil, 11, David, 5, and Jeffrey, 2, all have friends on the block.</p><p>Mr. Dorman, a partner in an accounting firm in Union, is, like many other local fathers, a volunteer coach in the Manalapan recreation program, which provides baseball, basketball and soccer teams for more than 1,200 children 5 to 18 years old.</p><p>Manalapan (pronounced man-AL-a-p'n), which means "land that produces good bread" in the Leni Lenape language, became a farming community when the first English, Dutch and Scottish settlers arrived late in the 17th century.</p><p>Among the earliest was John Reid, Surveyor General of the English Province of New Jersey, who bought large tracts from the Indian sachems Pyahekan and Wilgruylas in 1686. Reid deeded most of what is now Manalapan to his son-in-law John Anderson and his grandson John Anderson Jr.</p><p>In 1685, three men from nearby Shrewsbury -- Alexander Brown, Samuel Dennes and Thomas Hewett -- bought 3,000 acres from the Indians, subdivided it into more than two dozen farmsteads and sold them off.</p><p>Among the attractions for the 17th-century settlers was the abundance of streams and rivers, which were used to power grist, lumber and fulling mills.</p><p>Best-known of Manalapan's many historic buildings is the Old Tennent Church on Tennent Road. The Georgian-style 1751 cedar-clad church has a cemetery that dates to 1731, when an earlier church stood on the site. The Rev. John Tennent and his brother, the Rev. William Tennent Jr. were pastors of the churches from 1730 to 1777.</p><p>During the Revolution, nearly 30,000 British and Colonial troops fought the Battle of Monmouth on an area that straddles the current Manalapan-Freehold border. Although a clear victor was never established, official records indicate that about 500 men, three-fifths of them British, died in the battle. In 1978, the state bought 1,520 acres of farmland and opened Monmouth Battlefield State Park, 80 percent of which is in Manalapan.</p><p>The only other major park is the 93.5-acre Manalapan Recreation Center on the Freehold-Englishtown Road. It has three baseball diamonds, six soccer fields, six basketball courts, a fitness trail, six tennis courts, a roller-hockey rink and playgrounds.</p><p>Residents shop at two major supermarkets, at the 22-store Manalapan Mall on Route 9 and at several strip shopping centers on Routes 9 and 33. The town also has three large farm stores and the Englishtown Auction, a giant flea market established in 1929 as a farmer's auction market, on the Freehold-Englishtown Road.</p><p>AMONG the well-known restaurants are JJ's on Route 33 and the Battleground Country Club, which serve continental food. On Route 9 are Japantown, Hunan Gourmet and Jesse and David's, a kosher deli.</p><p>Children attend the four elementary schools and one middle school in the 4,150-student, k-8 Manalapan-Englishtown Regional School District. Superintendent of Schools Joseph F. Scozzari says that the schools use a whole-language approach, in which reading is taught within the framework of other disciplines, rather than on its own. He also said that the schools try to teach children how to learn and how to work in groups.</p><p>Manalapan's growth has brought class sizes to 30, rather than the 22 Mr. Scozzari considers ideal. A new state-of-the-art middle school, with fiber-optic wiring for computer networking, scheduled to be completed in July, is expected to ease some of the overcrowding.</p><p>Manalapan High School belongs to the Freehold Regional High School District, which includes four other schools and eight municipalities. The principal, Robert F. Breuche, says the regional approach lets the schools share services and programs and negotiate better purchases with vendors. It also lets them make specialized learning centers available to all students.</p><p>Manalapan High provides the science and engineering learning center; other schools have centers for international studies, computer sciences, business, performing arts and humanities.</p><p>Mr. Breuche says that 89 percent of Manalapan High School graduates go on to higher education. The school offers advanced placement courses in English, American history, calculus, physics, chemistry and biology.</p><p>Manalapan is home to the Monmouth County Library on Symmes Drive. Besides its extensive collection of books and films, the library also serves as a social center, sponsoring lectures, concerts, arts and crafts and movies.</p><p>Photo: Old Tennent Church on Tennent Road was built in 1751; one of the single-family houses on Regency Way.

Molly Pitcher: Diaries of at least two Colonial soldiers who fought in the Battle of Monmouth, which took place in and near Manalapan on June 28, 1778, recount the tale of Molly Pitcher, who carried water for the troops and helped operate a cannon after her husband was shot. After much controversy, historians identified Molly as Mary Hays, wife of Pvt. William Hays of the 4th Pennsylvania Artillery.
