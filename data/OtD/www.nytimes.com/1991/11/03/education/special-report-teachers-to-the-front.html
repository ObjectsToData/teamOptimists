That job description is rapidly becoming obsolete, but in the view of many experts the institutions that train teachers have been slow to adapt.</p><p>Many teachers are now required to work in teams, to develop their own courses and to serve on community school councils as an increasing number of districts around the nation attempt to shift power and responsibility to the educators closest to the students and away from centralized bureaucracies.</p><p>This pushing of teachers into leadership roles has been brought on by the popularity of concepts like site-based management, in which individual schools have greater independence in curriculum, community control and parental choice in the selection of schools. These ideas have been instituted primarily at the local school level.</p><p>"The restructuring and the invention are happening out in the schools at an incredible pace, but higher education is in the reactive mode and slow to move," said Ann Lieberman, a professor at Columbia University's Teachers College in New York.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Ms. Lieberman noted, for example, that the Central Park East Secondary School, in New York City, divides teachers into two teams, one teaching the humanities and the other sciences, in an interdisciplinary effort that focuses on themes rather than subjects. This requires the faculty to spend a half day a week in planning sessions while students work on community service projects. A Mismatch or a Success?</p><p>Some experts fear that a serious mismatch is developing as teachers are asked to handle tasks for which they are unprepared. The more optimistic view is that many teachers have become successful innovators with little help from theoreticians.</p><p>John I. Goodlad, director of the Center for Educational Renewal at the University of Washington in Seattle, worries that many teachers cannot keep pace. "Teachers are simply not trained to work together as colleagues and to be community leaders in the renewal of their schools," Mr. Goodlad said. "Most of the training teachers get is still geared to the old model."</p><p>After a five-year study of teacher training, Mr. Goodlad concluded that the most basic structures of college and graduate school education programs must themselves be reformed. Those programs, he said, are often tailored to individuals who can shape their own courses of study. He contrasted this to law and medical schools, which train their students in cohorts so that all receive the same core education. Also, he noted that when teachers are sent into schools for practical training, they rarely attend faculty meetings or administrative planning sessions.</p><p>"We train teachers to think of their jobs solely in terms of what happens when they are alone with their students," he said, "so they rarely get a sense of how a whole school functions. Now the reform movement is asking them to take part in the restructuring and administration of a whole school."</p><p>Even if major universities were to start changing their programs now, he said, "it would take so long to make the switch that it would be the end of the decade before we started getting properly trained teachers in any real numbers." As a result, Mr. Goodlad and other specialists believe that in the short term, local school districts will bear the responsibility of retraining the current generation of teachers to meet their new roles.</p><p>There are already results from these grass-roots efforts. For example, the Jefferson County schools in Louisville, Ky., began developing a research and training institution, the Gheens Academy, in 1983. With 131 of 150 schools in the district operating under some form of site-based management, the academy plays a major role in development for teachers and principals.</p><p>"Ten years ago the central office prescribed what teachers needed to do," said Terry Brooks, who directs the academy. "Now we are training teachers in a system driven by the needs of their customers, the students. The teachers are empowered to identify those needs; the job of the central office is to help fulfill that agenda."</p><p>Traditional staff-development programs in areas like pedagogy and classroom management have been augmented by courses in subjects like consensus-building, decision making and strategic planning, Mr. Brooks said. And rather than take this training as individuals, teachers learn as teams. 'A Common Vision'</p><p>The restructuring effort in Jefferson County starts from the premise that "schools need a common vision and a participatory form of government," Mr. Brooks said. To insure that this vision reflects the needs of students, one program has a teacher "shadowing" a student for a full day or more, following the student through all activities.</p><p>The Gheens Academy, like many other teacher institutions, borrows heavily from the corporate world. Administrators go through a senior management-training program offered by Bell South. Both teachers and principals spend time observing work teams at the Rohm and Haas Company's Louisville plant, where foremen and production workers consult on questions like budget and output.</p><p>The institutions that train teachers are now beginning to look at these local initiatives to learn which pedagogical techniques are worth adopting. Ms. Lieberman, for example, is co-director of the newly formed National Center for Restructuring Education, Schools and Teaching, which acts in part as a clearinghouse for information on new programs and transmits this information to teachers colleges and graduate schools."</p><p>So far, there appears to be a consensus among experts on two ways in which teacher preparation is changing. First, the distance between institutions that prepare teachers and those where teaching takes place is rapidly shrinking as institutions of higher education develop closer ties to local schools.</p><p>"This goes far beyond the old laboratory school concept," Ms. Lieberman said. "These are regular schools, with real populations that are closely linked to professional development programs and there is a burgeoning number of them all over the country. What this means is teachers teaching other teachers and constant inquiry into practical applications."</p><p>Second, teachers are getting a more thorough academic grounding before they start teaching. The interdisciplinary approach no longer permits a teacher to specialize in a single subject area, and teacher involvement in curriculum development demands far more knowledge than what is required to teach a class.</p><p>"These changes," Mr. Goodlad said, "are just in their infancy." But, he said, they will be far-reaching. "The difference between the teacher as a solitary figure behind a closed door and the teacher as steward of a school involves a profound shift in personality and character," he said. "The change in the way we train teachers will have to be equally profound."</p>                </div>
