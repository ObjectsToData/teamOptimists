                    <p>There was a long silence. Our hourlong conversation was over.</p><p>From the very beginning of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, the 49-year-old former Wyoming Congressman was an Administration emissary to the Arabs and a trusted spokesman, valued for his cool demeanor and measured testimony. He repeatedly reinforced the President's gut instincts for military intervention and helped to translate them into a deployment of 425,000 troops by mid-January.</p><p>On Aug. 4, two days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Defense Secretary pushed for use of American troops to protect Saudi Arabia. In October, with Saddam Hussein not budging, Cheney recommended that the President send reinforcements to provide a credible "offensive military option." The aim was to intensify the pressure on Saddam Hussein to withdraw and lay the groundwork to defeat him in battle if he didn't. Cheney later told Congress that only military force, not economic sanctions, could insure that Iraqi troops would leave Kuwait.</p><p>The Defense Secretary, who never served in the armed forces, took a more hawkish stand than several of his predecessors and many military officers. Harold Brown, James R. Schlesinger and Caspar W. Weinberger, the hard-line Reaganite, all argued that sanctions be given more time before any military attack began. That was also the public position of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the American commander in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>"I would not go so far as to say Cheney is egging the President on, but he is on the same wavelength," a senior Administration official said in December. "Much of the military seem more reluctant. They are way behind Cheney."</p><p>Why is he such a hawk? The answer rests partly with his innate conservatism and partly with his loyalty to George Bush.</p><p>If Cheney had doubts about the United States march toward war, he contained them behind his iron reserve. He gave no hint of the worries openly voiced by military experts like Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who favored the sanctions approach and warned before the American strike on Iraq that Washington might be caught in a prolonged, costly and unnecessary war.</p><p>On Sunday morning news programs, week after week, Cheney coolly presented the Administration's case. And at press conferences before and during the war, he and Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a stoic team.</p><p>"He is calm inside," Lynne Vincent Cheney, his wife of 26 years and chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, said of her husband's mood a few days before the United States launched its attack. "He is a man with a deeply held conviction, and he does sleep well. But he is not dispassionate. He never talked much. But he is even quieter now. He is quieter and thinking more." FIGHTING IN THE Persian Gulf was about the last thing anybody expected when Cheney came to the Defense Department in March 1989. In the months that followed, it looked as if his main challenge would be to scale down and reorganize the post-cold war military in line with new White House policies toward Moscow. Change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was overturning decades-old precepts of strategic planning. When Defense Department officials weren't on Capitol Hill, they were worrying about third-world trouble spots like the Philippines and Central America.</p><p>The defense of the Arabian oil fields, a priority that had long been second only to the security of Europe, was suffering from benign neglect in light of the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran and a perceived lessening of the Soviet threat to Iran. The Persian Gulf was mentioned only in passing in National Military Strategy, a classified report issued in August 1989 by Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The report mentioned protecting the gulf in the same breath as maintaining access to the "critical natural resources of South American and Africa."</p><p>Before August, the Defense Secretary's chief accomplishment -- with help from General Powell, his trusted ally -- was a plan for reducing the military by 25 percent. The Defense Secretary has also been credited for his efforts, belated though they were, to shake up the Pentagon's procurement bureaucracy. His cancellation of the Navy's $57 billion A-12 Avenger attack plane this month followed complaints that military contractors misled him about the cost and progress of the project. Nonetheless, his decision stunned the weapons industry, which had grown accustomed to cost overruns and Government bailouts.</p>                </div>
