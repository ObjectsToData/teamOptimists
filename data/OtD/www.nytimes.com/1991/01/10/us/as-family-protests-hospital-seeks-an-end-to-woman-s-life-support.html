Over the objections of the state hospital where Miss Cruzan lived in a vegetative coma, the tube was removed and she died last month.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"We've all worked long and hard for the patient's right to say stop," said Susan M. Wolf, an associate for law at the Hastings Center, a research center for biomedical ethics in Briarcliff, N.Y. "That leaves the lurking question of whether it's a symmetrical issue and they also have the right to say do everything indefinitely, even when the doctors believe it's futile."</p><p>It is a rare termination-of-care case of any kind that reaches the courtroom. Decisions to withdraw medical technology are made daily around the country. The American Hospital Association estimates that 70 percent of hospital deaths are preceded by a decision to stop some form of care. Yet Dr. Caplan said he knew of no more than 40 state court opinions about ending care.</p><p>It is even rarer that a dispute finds the doctors arguing for withdrawal of life support against the wishes of the patient's family. "None of those 40 address that situation," he said. "If there is such a case, it's the exception."</p><p>Ms. Wolf agreed. "Maybe one other case has been reported where this kind of role reversal took place," she said, but she added that she was not familar with one.</p><p>The reason there are few court cases of this type, experts say, is because doctors are reluctant to publicly advocate the death of a patient.</p><p>Dr. Eugene Boisaubin, an emergency room doctor who is head of the biomedical ethics consultation service at the Methodist Hospital in Houston, said circumstances similar to those of the Wanglie family arose regularly.</p><p>He estimates that 95 percent of the disagreements can be resolved with talking and time. In the other 5 percent of cases, he said, "we do what the family wants, even though it goes against our medical judgment. We do know that the patient will die, but not until weeks or months later. Until this, no one had the guts to go to court."</p><p>He said that he had heard of hospitals choosing to override the family and disconnect life support without a court order, he said but that his hospital had never chosen to do so. It Began With Fractured Hip</p><p>The case that Hennepin County Medical Center plans to take to court began on Dec. 14, 1989, when Mrs. Wanglie tripped on a scatter rug in her hallway and fractured her right hip. She was taken to a private hospital near her home where she underwent surgery.</p><p>The next month she developed breathing problems and was transferred to the Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was placed on a respirator. She stayed there for five months, fully conscious and alert, writing notes to her doctors and her husband, Oliver, since the breathing tube down her throat prevented her from speaking.</p><p>In May she was weaned from her respirator and transferred to a longterm care institution across the river in St. Paul. She had been in the institution for less than a week when her heartbeat and breathing stopped suddenly. By the time she could be resuscitated she had suffered severe brain damage and was transferred back to Hennepin County Medical Center in a vegetative state.</p><p>"She doesn't know anybody or anything," said Mr. Wanglie, 86, a retired Minneapolis lawyer. He and his children, Ruth, 48, and David, 45, visit two or three times a week, he said. They stay about a half an hour and talk to the nurses about Mrs. Wanglie's condition, but they do not talk to his wife, he said, because "she wouldn't even know we were there."</p><p>Mr. Wanglie said the doctors caring for his wife first raised the question of turning off her ventilator in late May. At a meeting in a hospital conference room, he said, the family vehemently objected. He told the doctors that his wife of 53 years would have wanted to live.</p><p>Mrs. Wanglie, a retired school teacher, is the daughter of a Lutheran minister "and she has strong religious convictions," her husband said in an interview. "We talked about this a year ago. If anything happened to her, she said, she wants everything done.</p><p>"She told me, 'Only He who gave life has the right to take life,' " Mr. Wanglie said of a discussion he had with his wife before her fall. He said she had never put those thoughts into writing.</p><p>"It seems to me they're trying to play God," Mr. Wanglie said. "Who are they to determine who's to die and who's to live? I take the position that as long as her heart is beating there's life there."</p>                </div>
