    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  WHETHER one is for or against abortion, one of the fixed points in the debate has been the Roman Catholic Church's teaching that human life deserves full protection from the moment of conception. Now in two important scholarly articles, several Roman Catholic ethicists are questioning whether the very earliest stage of fetal development can legitimately be thought of as an individual human life.    Both articles discuss what has come to be called the pre-embryo, the stage of human development that lasts for approximately two weeks after the union of sperm and ovum.  During this period, argues the Rev. Richard A. McCormick, a leading Catholic moral theologian, the new life does not exhibit the stable and determinate character necessary for considering it a distinct individual, or a person with human rights. He makes his case in the premier issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, a quarterly that the Georgetown University research institute, known primarily for its work in medical ethics, will begin publishing next month.">

He makes his case in the premier issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, a quarterly that the Georgetown University research institute, known primarily for its work in medical ethics, will begin publishing next month.</p><p>An even more elaborate argument along the same lines appears in the current issue of Theological Studies, the leading American Catholic theological journal, published by the Jesuits. The authors are Thomas A. Shannon, an ethicist in the humanities department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass., and the Rev. Allan B. Wolter, a professor emeritus of philosophy at Catholic University of America.</p><p>These articles are not rebellions against church authority nor defections in the conflict over abortion.  And though the arguments may contain potentially radical concepts, they are not immediately relevant to the vast number of abortions, which occur much later in pregnancy. But the articles demonstrate that the abortion debate is not as frozen as it often seems. Increasing knowledge about fetal development and pressure to get beyond a political stalemate is leading both camps to rethink old positions and consider new ones. Growing precision about the development of the embryo's brain and nervous system, for example, has spurred recent proposals for a definition of "brain birth" to mark the beginning of life just as "brain death" marks the end.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Many of the scientific developments are welcomed by abortion opponents. Heightened awareness of risks to fetal health has strengthened the sense of continuity between life before and after birth. Because sonograms are now routinely used to check for fetal abnormalities, the first "baby picture" may date from the 15th week of pregnancy.</p><p>But another scientific development has produced new ethical puzzles for both sides in the debate. During in-vitro fertilization, multiple eggs are normally obtained from a prospective mother and fertilized in the laboratory. Some will be reimplanted but others will be discarded, frozen for future use or used in the laboratory for research purposes.Government commissions and courts in several nations have struggled to determine the moral status of this pre-embryonic life. Father McCormick, Dr. Shannon and Father Wolter believe that at this earliest stage of human development, an established anti-abortion position has to yield before new data.</p><p>Actually, while official Catholic documents on abortion insist that new human life deserves full protection "from the moment of conception," they differ from anti-abortion literature that portrays even the fertilized egg as an "unborn baby." Key Vatican documents sometimes maintain a cautious reserve about whether "the fruit of conception is already a human person," simply warning that when in doubt one must avoid the risk of murder.</p><p>But at other points, these documents stress that conception initiates a distinct and genetically unique existence: "from fertilization the biological identity of a new human individual is already constituted."</p><p>The authors of the recent articles argue, however, that the pre-embryo is not at all the kind of distinct individual that church teaching supposes. Citing recent biological research, they note that at the first stages of cell division, each cell is identical and "totipotent" -- capable, if separated, of producing a complete adult.  Furthermore, a pre-embryo can divide into twins and then recombine into a single entity.  Eggs and Humans</p><p>In short, Dr. Shannon and Father Wolter conclude, the pre-embryo lacks the "determinate and irreversible individuality" that is "a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for it to be a human person." The pre-embryo may be distinct from its parents and have "genetic individuality," says Father McCormick, but not "developmental individuality." Pre-embryonic life deserves protection, both articles conclude, but not of an absolute sort that couldn't be set aside for serious reasons. Father McCormick is wary, however, of pre-embryonic experimentation and urges that it be subject to national regulation.</p><p>There are both recent and venerable Catholic precedents for these views. Catholic moralists have found it intuitively difficult to equate fertilized ova with full human beings when perhaps half or more of the eggs are lost after failing to implant themselves in the uterus.</p><p>Dr. Shannon and Father Wolter explicitly link their views to the belief prevalent in the ancient and medieval church that abortion, though condemned for a variety of reasons, does not constitute murder until the point in the pregnancy where the fetus takes on a distinctly human form and human soul. This older theory of "delayed animation" may have rested on outdated biology but so too, they contend, does the teaching that sees a genuine individual in the pre-embryo.</p><p>"Delayed animation" is often invoked by proponents of "brain birth," who would mark the beginning of personhood or protectible human life from some key point in the maturation of the fetal brain and nervous system. In a yet-unpublished paper, Dr. Shannon accepts this notion. But he notes that different proponents of "brain birth" have chosen points in the development of the nervous system ranging between 8 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.</p><p>Father McCormick is skeptical about "brain birth" as an answer to the moral problem of abortion although he agrees that it might foster a consensus for purposes of public policy. "Why is brain activity so important?" he asks. Other writers have warned against equating brain and self and objected that the attractive symmetry between "brain birth" and "brain death" may be superficial. Fetal brain activity does not instigate a process of integrated organic development in the same way that adult loss of brain activity ends it.</p><p>Implicit in these discussions is a principle that challenges both camps in the abortion debate. Judgments about the moral significance of unborn life, these scholars are arguing, can never be purely scientific, but neither can they be purely personal or dogmatic, reached without regard to the underlying biological realities.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
