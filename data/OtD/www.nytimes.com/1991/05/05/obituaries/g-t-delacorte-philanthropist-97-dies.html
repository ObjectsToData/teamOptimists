                    <p>George T. Delacorte, the founder of Dell Publishing and a philanthropist who gave millions to embellish New York City with fountains, statues, theaters and schools that bear his name, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 97 years old and also lived in North Palm Beach, Fla., and Sharon, Conn.</p><p>A son, Albert, said Mr. Delacorte had not been ill and apparently died in his sleep of natural causes.</p><p>Mr. Delacorte made his fortune publishing everything from penny-a-word mysteries and romances to comic books -- Mickey Mouse, Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny -- to the novels of Kurt Vonnegut, James Clavell, James Jones and Irwin Shaw. But his name became chiseled into the consciousness of New Yorkers as the man who gave them the Delacorte Clock, Delacorte Fountain and Delacorte Amphitheater in Central Park and, at Columbia University, the Delacorte Professorship in the Humanities and the Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism.</p><p>His most popular contribution may be the enchanting Alice-in-Wonderland statue that he placed in what he called "the finest spot in Central Park" in 1959.

                    <p>The statue, just north of the Conservatory Pond, was given as a memorial to his first wife, Margarita, because, it was said, she used to read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to their six children. "I don't know," he said. "It's a good story. It just seemed a nice thing to have in the park. On Sunday mornings I watch the kids climbing over it, under it. It's a regular parade."</p><p>Not far away to the south is the Delacorte Clock at the Children's Zoo, a whimsical carousel with a dancing bear, an elephant playing a concertina, a kangaroo with a horn and other animal figures that perform every half hour to the music of a glockenspiel. To the west is the Delacorte Amphitheater, home to Shakespeare in the Park. A mobile Delacorte Theater made it possible to take Shakespeare to other parks around the city. At Columbus Circle and at Bowling Green and at City Hall are Delacorte fountains.</p><p>In 1985 Mr. Delacorte, by then in his 90's, gave Columbia, his alma mater, $2,250,000 to create the George T. Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism. He then pledged an additional $2 million to establish a chair in his name.</p><p>In 1982 Columbia had awarded him an honorary doctorate after he had contributed the ornamental iron gates that formed the entry to the university and had paid for the planting of cherry trees, shrubs and ivy ground cover on the campus. In 1975 Mr. Delacorte gave $750,000 to Columbia to establish the Delacorte Professorship in the Humanities.  'Delacorte's Folly'</p><p>But of all his contributions, his own favorite remained the Delacorte geyser at the tip of Roosevelt Island. He and his wife called it "Delacorte's Folly." In 1969, Mr. Delacorte conceived the idea that New York should have a geyser equal to the Jet D'Eau in Lake Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p>His geyser, at 400 feet, was to be the highest fountain in the world, but many New Yorkers were outraged that, when built, the $350,000 jet spewed polluted East River water into the air. He was forced to chlorinate the fountain. Then the chlorination withered trees that Sutton Place residents had placed on the island to improve their view. Mr. Delacorte was more annoyed than moved by the complaints. He said his fountain was there before the trees.</p><p>In an editorial when the fountain was installed, The New York Times, citing the city's crucial needs and noting that the money might have been put to better use instead of being thrown "literally down the drain," called him "the wrong-way Corrigan of New York philanthropy."</p><p>In his 90's, when he was asked whether he had given any thought to using the $350,000 to help the poor, he said, "People are poor because they're dumb or because they're lazy. If you feed them you just keep them in the same strata."  'I Hate Hospitals'</p><p>Mr. Delacorte was a philanthropic loner who did not like to serve on the boards of museums or schools or hospitals. "I hate hospitals," he said. Instead, he gave money where and when he liked to whatever struck his fancy. Only once, did he join with others. That was in 1964, when he helped create a group called "Make New York Beautiful Inc,," to "promote interest and aid in the donation of permanent improvements to the City of New York for its cultural advancement and beautification."</p><p>With the straightforwardness that characterized his public comments, he said, "We want guys who are going to kick off, and want to do something for the city before they do, to give maybe $ l00,000 or $500,000."</p><p>George Thomas Delacorte Jr. was born in New York City on June 20, 1893. He attended Boys High and went to Harvard before switching to Columbia, where he graduated in 1913. By that time he was married and brought his first son to his graduation ceremony. Afterward, determined not to be a lawyer as his father was, Mr. Delacorte went to work for a small publishing company.</p><p>When he was dismissed the company paid him the $10,000 he had been promised in his contract, enough to found his own company, Dell Publishing. It was 1921 and the beginings were small -- two employees and one title, "I Confess." Soon, he was turning out dozens of pulp magazines with penny-a-word stories: "Cupid's Diary," "Screen Stories," and "Inside Detective."  'Read a Fresh Magazine'</p>                </div>
