"Now they're helping make it available to us in the West."</p><p>The books are remarkable for detailing everything from Soviet military training methods to specification of the most modern Soviet submarines and airplanes, and publishers are gambling that American readers will be sufficiently intrigued by the revelations of what was once classified information to make the books big sellers.</p><p>Some of the information in the books has come from unofficial Soviet sources and some from ranking military and intelligence sources in Eastern Europe. But most was supplied by Soviet officials who, for political and economic reasons, have been willing to provide Western publishers with facts, figures and photographs that were formerly kept secret.

                    <p>"We're now at the end of the cold war, we hope, and the Soviets are much more open at every level," said John W. R. Taylor, who for 30 years was editor of "Jane's All the World's Aircraft," one of the series of authoritative military reference books published in London.</p><p>Mr. Taylor is also the editor of "Soviet Wings: Modern Soviet Military Aircraft," just published by Presidio Press in Novato, Calif. and simultaneously by publishers in England, Canada, France, Japan, Yugoslavia, Italy and Germany. The book consists of 141 color photographs never before published in the West, including some featuring the latest Soviet combat aircraft. All the photos are by Aleksandr M. Dzhus, a Soviet aerial photographer.</p><p>Soviet aircraft have sometimes participated in air shows in the West, but Mr. Taylor and others said those planes were usually photographed sitting on runways, their weapons covered up. But "Soviet Wings" shows them taking off from carrier decks, shows their armament and electronic jamming equipment and has detailed specifications.</p><p>"We had so few good pictures of Soviet aircraft that the joke in aviation and intelligence circles was that they built only blurred aircraft," said Lionel Leventhal, the head of Greenhill Books in London, a leading publisher of military books. Mr. Leventhal acquired the photographs for "Soviet Wings" from a Moscow publisher and arranged for the book's simultaneous publication on three continents (but not in the Soviet Union).</p><p>The book is a main selection of the Military Book Club. "It's something of a gamble for us," Mr. Feder said, "because it's an expensive book." (It retails for $50, and the club price is $30.) "But some of those planes haven't been seen before, and most of the photographs compare well to those of American aviation photographers." A Year With the Soviet Military</p><p>Next month, AbbevillePress will publish "Inside the Soviet Military" by Carey Schofield, a British journalist, with photographs by Leonid Yakutin, a Soviet naval officer and military photographer. They spent a year with the Soviet military, visiting a naval base at Vladivostok, covering parachute training at Ryazan, watching the winter maneuvers of Warsaw Pact troops and visiting many other bases, units and warships.</p><p>In his foreword to the book, Christopher Donnelly, Sovietologist in residence for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, wrote that never before had a Western observer been allowed to see and report on the Soviet armed forces from the inside, and never had such unrestricted access to military installations and personnel been granted.</p><p>"That it was granted at all is amazing," Mr. Donnelly said. "That it has been granted so completely and free from official restraint is one of the most heartening signs for the development of that dialogue essential to a permanent improvement of relations between the U.S.S.R. and the West."</p><p>The reasons for such cooperation are not always clear, although the authors and publishers of those books attribute it to the new Soviet policies of openness. But there may be other motivations as well. Asked what inspired the Soviet authorities to make available the revealing photographs of Soviet planes, Mr. Leventhal replied: "Money. I'm paying them in Western currency." He declined to say how much. Airplanes and Submarines</p><p>Norman Polmar, a naval analyst and a consultant to the Department of Defense, said: "The Soviets for years have wanted to sell commercial airplanes, and 'Soviet Wings' is a reflection of that goal. But they're not as open about their submarine fleet, because they're not trying to sell submarines."</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr. Polmar received greater cooperation from Soviet officials than he expected while writing "Submarines of the Russian and Soviet Navies, 1718-1990." Just published by the Naval Institute Press , the detailed book is co-authored with Jurrien Noot, a research analyst on the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.</p><p>Mr. Polmar said his requests for photographs and certain specifications were honored sometimes and disregarded at other times with no discernable pattern. Nevertheless, he said he had noticed big differences in Soviet attitudes about its military.</p><p>"I sat down with the new Soviet naval attache a few weeks ago," he said, "and at that first meeting he told me he was a Soviet nuclear submariner. Ten years ago when you met a Soviet attache, they would always say there are in headquarters, or on staff work, or served on surface ships. They just didn't talk about who they were and what they did."</p><p>The Soviet Union is not forthcoming about everything pertaining to its military, said Milan Vego, a former Yugoslav naval officer who teaches at the Defense Intelligence College and is a consultant at the Center for Naval Analyses.</p><p>"They have opened up some archives, and it's possible to subscribe to Soviet magazines that were formerly forbidden, so for the first time you can consult originals on military subjects," Mr. Vego said. "But the Soviets still are not forthcoming about tactics; those you have to pursue in East European magazines."</p><p>Despite such detours, publishers say they expect the openness to continue. Aristide D. Caratzas, which publishes books in the humanities and modern history, is planning a range of books from the Soviet Union, including geographical handbooks. And Presidio Press has contracts with high-ranking Soviet military officers for four books, including one on the Afghan war told from the Soviet perspective, and another describing Soviet military aid to North Korea and North Vietnam, and to Egypt and Syria in their wars against Israel.</p>                </div>
