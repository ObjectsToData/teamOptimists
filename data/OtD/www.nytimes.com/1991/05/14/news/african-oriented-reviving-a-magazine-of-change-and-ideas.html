Two young men deeply influenced by Transition were the American literary critic Henry Louis Gates Jr., who becomes the W. E. B. Du Bois professor of humanities at Harvard on July 1, and Kwame Anthony Appiah, the Ghanaian essayist and novelist. Among Transition's editors in chief was Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986.">

The quarterly journal's first new issue, published and distributed by Oxford University Press, will appear this month, with a color photograph of Nelson Mandela on the cover.</p><p>The idea, Mr. Gates said, is to publish "an international journal with Africa at its center."

                    <p>The editors say they feel that the original Transition came along at a crucial turning point in Africa, the beginnings of decolonialization. They feel that Mr. Mandela's release from prison last year, combined with the weakening of dictators all over the continent, make this period equally portentous, and thus a propitious time for the rebirth of a magazine dedicated, they say, to the free exchange of opinions and ideas.</p><p>"I'd like to see Transition serve a kind of glasnost in Africa," Mr. Gates said. "Thirty years ago exactly Transition was launched at a time of great possibility. Now, with the release of Mandela we have another momentous event. I'd like to see Transition move beyond ideology and allow for different voices to interact with each other. As far as I know, there's no journal in Africa serving that function."</p><p>Mr. Soyinka may have indicated the tone of the new Transition in an essay he wrote for the inaugural issue, in which he talks about what might be called the spirit of Berlin in Africa. It is in many ways a harsh essay, extremely critical and unsentimental about Africa's first 30 years of independence. It calls for the eradication of all isms, all dogmas, all sentimental nationalisms that, he believes, have caused untold suffering on the African continent.</p><p>"Two walls, two bastions of human separation, have fallen," Mr. Soyinka writes. One is the Berlin wall, the other the wall that kept Mr. Mandela a prisoner for more than 20 years in South Africa. The collapse of those walls, he says, are real events but they are also metaphors for a basic historical change taking place now, not only at the end of a century but at the edge of a millennium.</p><p>"The dismantling of totalitarian structures across nearly all of Europe," he writes, "surely vies, even for us Africans, for primary significance with the release of Nelson Mandela and the sounds of violent tremors in the foundations of the wall of apartheid."</p><p>But, in an essay called "Beyond the Berlin Wall," Mr. Soyinka, who was once imprisoned in Uganda and exiled from Nigeria, argues that Africa, while often blaming its problems on what is commonly called colonialism or neo-colonialism, has also undermined itself from within, often using the verbiage of anti-colonialism as an excuse for dictatorship.</p><p>"A wall of ideological self-right eousness, festooned with its spurious anti-Western phobia and persecution complex, entombs hundreds of thousands," he writes, specifically citing the Marxist Government of Ethiopia as an example of dogma gone rampant. Part of the legacy of African intellectuals, he writes, consisted of "excusing, ignoring, or even justifying leadership atrocities and betrayals, simply because they are of the 'left.' " Strong American Role</p><p>In fact, Mr. Soyinka, as the chairman of the editorial board, says he will not play a major role in running the magazine. That will be up to its co-editors, Mr. Gates and Mr. Appiah. Their idea, Mr. Gates said, is to keep dogma out and a variety of opinions in. Unlike its predecessor, the new Transition will be edited largely in this country, so the role of black Americans, while important before, is likely to be even more important now. And, that, both men allowed, is a complicated matter if only because of the complexity of the relationship many blacks in this country have toward Africa.</p><p>In his essay, Mr. Soyinka describes "a high-powered black intellectual caucus" that went on a fact-finding mission to Uganda just at a time when the dictator Idi Amin Dada was slaughtering his foes and throwing them to the crocodiles. The commission, which, Mr. Soyinka says, was treated to Mr. Amin's "lavish hospitality," returned home "full of glowing reports of this avuncular leader, so maliciously vilified for his pan-Africanist, progressive stance against the rapacious, patronizing capitalist West." In short, it would be a mistake, the editors of the new Transition are saying, to allow a sentimentalized vision of Africa stand in the way of the truth.</p><p>"Often I find myself in arguments with people who make claims about what Africa is but don't know what they're talking about," Mr. Gates said. "I'd like to see African-Americans more thoroughly involved in dialogue with Africans and I think that will save them a lot of embarrassing sentimentalizing."</p><p>"There will be no party line," Mr. Gates said of the reborn Transition. A Call to the Left</p><p>In addition to Mr. Soyinka's essay, the first issue of the reborn Transition contains an essay by the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes harshly critical of "ideological oneness, devoid of competition or criticism," and calling for a revived political left that can "promote social justice and a step-by-step program of economic growth."</p><p>In an essay entitled "On Seeing England for the First Time," the novelist Jamaica Kincaid writes with a kind of bitter lightheartedness of the way the power of English culture in her native Antigua made her assume from a very early age that English culture was the only culture.</p><p>"The reality of my life was conquests, subjugation, humiliation, enforced amnesia," she writes, arguing, in effect, that among colonialism's products was the "cultural erasure" of its subjects.</p><p>The first issue has an essay by Rob Nixon on Mr. Mandela warning that the media's "Mandelmania," the impulse to turn the anti-apartheid leader into a demigod, represents a dangerous temptation for his followers.  There are articles on AIDS in Africa, on women in South Africa and on the effects of World Bank austerity programs on African economies. There is an essay on affirmative action in this country, on the controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts, on the cultural critic Stanley Crouch and on Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica.</p><p>If there is a common thread in all of these writings it would seem to be the sense of Africa, not as exotic or far away, but as central to world culture.  In the academic world these days, it is fashionable to talk of "minority cultures" as having been forced to what is called "the periphery," while what is seen as white European culture is "the center." It is a schema that, Mr. Gates said, Transition will resist.</p><p>"Too many people have seen Africa as a metaphor for otherness, isolation and difference," Mr. Gates said. "We don't want to perpetuate that myth. Africa is thoroughly in the world and the world is in Africa, and Transition will reflect the centrality of both to each other."</p><p>Photo: Wole Soyinka, chairman of the editorial board of Transition (Sara Krulwich/The New York Times)</p>                </div>
