                    <p>By the opening in Munich in July 1937 of the gigantic "Entartete Kunst," or "Degenerate Art," exhibition that is dramatically if not completely re-created in a memorable show here at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the fate of culture under Hitler had already been spelled out.</p><p>The writings of Thomas Mann, Ernest Hemingway, Helen Keller and Hannah Arendt helped to fuel Nazi bonfires in 1933; the next year, Carl von Ossietzky, the social theorist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, was sent to a concentration camp. When the writer Heinrich Heine warned at the time that "where books are burned, people are burned," he predicted the future only too well.</p><p>As for the German museums, they had been under attack since the 20's, and with the rise to power of the National Socialists in 1933, Expressionist, Cubist, Futurist, Dadaist and virtually every other kind of modern art had been ordered into storage or onto the auction block. Museum directors who supported what the Nazis derided as "Jewish-Bolshevist" culture found themselves out of a job, and a series of "degenerate" art shows, precursors to the Munich event, were staged throughout Germany.</p><p>George Grosz was one of many artists who fled in 1933, beginning what would be a cultural diaspora that benefited immeasurably countries like the United States. "I left because of Hitler," Grosz explained.  "He is a painter too, you know, and there didn't seem to be room for both of us in Germany." Grosz's colleague Max Beckmann waited until the day before the opening of the Munich show before he packed his bags for Amsterdam.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany," herethrough May 12, aims to re-create not only the 1937 exhibition but also the atmosphere of terror that pervaded all aspects of cultural life under the Nazi leader and his Minister for National Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels.</p><p>The show brings together more than 175 of some 650 works that had been on view in Munich. Many of the other objects have been lost or were destroyed by the Nazis. Nearly 100 public and private collections around the world have contributed to the exhibition here, which has been designed by the architectural firm of Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates and is accompanied by a catalogue that is a model of historical detail.</p><p>To convey the scope of Hitler's cultural oppression, the show begins with clips from movies like Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" that had been deemed degenerate, copies of banned books and snippets from recordings of music that had been outlawed.</p><p>Rare film of Nazi-sponsored pageants and of the crowds wandering through the display in Munich has been unearthed and put on view here. Nazi pamphlets, reviews of the "Entartete Kunst" show, material on the 1939 auctioning off by the Nazis of some of the great works of modern art from German museums at the Fischer Gallery in Switzerland, and a 22-foot-long model re-creating the 1937 display round out the didactic but consistently compelling exhibition. A related film program and a series of concerts by the Los Angeles Philharmonic featuring what the Nazis had deemed degenerate music are among many events arranged to coincide with the show.</p><p>Painstakingly organized over the course of five years by Stephanie Barron, curator of 20th-century art at the museum, "Degenerate Art" (which travels to the Art Institute of Chicago from June 22 to Sept. 8) is nothing less than a tour-de-force of reconstructive scholarship. It is also more: a morality tale that can never be told too often and that here unfolds in one riveting chapter after another.</p><p>Coming by happenstance in the midst of debates over public financing of the arts and freedom of expression, the show will inevitably stir contemporary associations in the minds of many observers. There are chilling echoes, to be sure, in the Nazi tactics of prohibiting children from the 1937 exhibition -- as if paintings by artists like Marc Chagall and Oskar Kokoschka were obscene -- and of displaying the prices public museums had paid for the supposedly worthless art on view. "Taxpayer, you should know how your money was spent," declared a sign in Mannheim at the time of that city's "Images of Cultural Bolshevism" exhibition, a precursor of the Munich show.</p><p>But to see "Degenerate Art" is also to realize the profound distance between Germany in 1937 and the United States today: it is one thing to be denied a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and it is another thing entirely to die in a concentration camp, like the artist Otto Freundlich, or be driven to suicide, like the painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and the philosopher Walter Benjamin. "Degenerate Art" (which has been partly supported by grants from both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as from the German Government) is an unspoken admonishment of those who trivialize or hope to capitalize on issues like freedom of speech.</p><p>The exhibition of 1937 was different in scale from the previous "degenerate" displays. Its more than 650 objects, selected from thousands that had been confiscated by Nazi officials from 32 German collections, were crammed into Munich's Archeological Institute. Works by 112 artists -- only 6 of them Jewish -- were included.</p>                </div>
