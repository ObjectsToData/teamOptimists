A Providence, R.I., television news reporter was calling from a car phone, trying to identify a very large 19th-century painting offered at an estate sale.    The canvas measured 6 feet by 10 feet. The artist had rendered a mountain and a lake. The date seemed to be 1858. And there was a signature, &quot;ABierstadt.&quot;">

The artist had rendered a mountain and a lake. The date seemed to be 1858. And there was a signature, "ABierstadt."</p><p>As Dr. Ferber elicited more and more of the details, she realized that the 20th-century telephone description closely corresponded with the 19th-century contemporary accounts of a celebrated work that had been missing for 108 years.</p><p>It was "Lake Lucerne," a panoramic portrait of the Swiss lake that was the most ambitious of the early works of the painter Albert Bierstadt. And although the painting had been heralded during its exhibition debut at the National Academy of Design in Manhattan in 1858, it had dropped out of sight after its sale to an anonymous buyer in 1882.

                    <p>The car-phone call was of more than passing interest to Dr. Ferber. She and a co-curator were at that moment assembling the most comprehensive Bierstadt show ever mounted, "Albert Bierstadt: Art and Enterprise." The exhibition -- which opens at the Brooklyn Museum this Friday, and later this year will travel on to San Francisco and the National Gallery of Art in Washington -- was their attempt to assemble, for the first time, Bierstadt's greatest paintings under the same roof.</p><p>But the lost "Lake Lucerne" was a major missing link. "It fell at an important juncture in Bierstadt's career, and summarized all he had learned," said Dr. Nancy K. Anderson, the co-curator of the exhibition. She is assistant curator of American art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and she had tried for years to track down the painting in New England.</p><p>After receiving the tip, Dr. Ferber and Dr. Anderson flew to Warwick, R.I., to inspect the painting. "As soon as we saw it, there was no question about its authenticity," Dr. Ferber said. It had been purchased by an Essex, R.I., shipping merchant, William Sunderland, and been hidden away in the same house for 70 years by a reclusive relative, whose estate was put up for sale after her death in 1989.</p><p>"Lake Lucerne" was not found in time to be shown at the Brooklyn Museum, but it will join the Bierstadt show after being cleaned and restored, probably, Dr. Ferber said, after the exhibition has reached the National Gallery in November. The curators did manage to insert a color image of the work in the catalogue as it was going to press, so that museumgoers can see it in the context of the other Bierstadts. "Lake Lucerne" was purchased by Richard M. Scaife and Margaret R. Battle as a gift to the National Gallery for its 50th anniversary celebration this year. Gilt, and Plenty of It</p><p>The painting was even mounted in its original foot-wide gilt frame, giving the curators valuable new information about the artist's taste in presentation. "It's the kind of thing a curator dreams of happening," said Dr. Ferber.</p><p>The phone call about "Lake Lucerne" had not come to Dr. Ferber by chance; it had been directed to her because of her thoroughness in alerting the nation's art community to the Brooklyn Museum's quest for Bierstadts. The television reporter had called an expert at Christie's, the Manhattan auction house, who steered her to Dr. Ferber.</p><p>In fact, the presentation of the 74 canvases in the mammoth Bierstadt exhibition, which runs at the Brooklyn Museum until May 5, was the product of five years of curatorial hurly-burly, a good measure of dogged detective work, and the occasional bit of dumb luck. Those efforts yielded not only a remarkable harvest of long-lost works, but also new information about Bierstadt, and new insights about the works of this landscape painter whose heroic 19th-century panoramas of the West came to embody a nation's vision of itself.</p><p>So ambitious was the dragnet for Bierstadts that owners of "lost" paintings, who had never called attention to their works before, offered their treasures to the museum. Among the Bierstadts in the show that were flushed out in the search were "Nebraska Territory: Wasatch Mountains," (1859), "Wind River Country" (1859) and "Haying, Conway Meadows" (1864). California Is Heard From</p><p>"Another of the paintings, 'Mountain Brook,' has never seen the light of day in a museum gallery," Dr. Ferber said. It was last exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1863. No one knew of its existence until it turned up in a collection in California last year.</p><p>Bierstadt, born in Germany near Dusseldorf in 1830, was brought to the United States by his parents two years later. After studying in Europe, he made overland painting-and-sketching journeys to the Rocky Mountains and to the Pacific Coast in 1859 and 1863. His Western paintings made him a celebrity and solidified his reputation as a master. The prices fetched by his great canvases -- as much as $50,000 -- became legendary in their own right.</p>                </div>
