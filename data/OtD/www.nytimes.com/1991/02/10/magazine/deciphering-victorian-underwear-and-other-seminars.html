Near the entrance to the Hyatt Regency Hotel on East Wacker Drive, assistant professors in black leather pegged pants wade through icy slush. Andrew Ross watches them impassively. Under his mane of unruly hair he looks exhausted, but so do the hundreds of other literature scholars who eddy about in the hotel lobby, arguing.   &quot;I haven't been outside in 72 hours,&quot; Ross murmurs in his throaty Edinburgh burr. Born in Scotland, Ross is a 34-year-old Marxist scholar of American popular culture who was recently recommended by Princeton's department of English for tenure. A former roustabout on North Sea oil platforms as well as the former butler of the great-grandson of Giuseppe Verdi in Berkeley, Calif., Ross has so far produced three books and 50 articles, his subjects ranging from Batman comics and computer hackers to new-age trance channeling and the semiotics of the Weather Channel.">

Near the entrance to the Hyatt Regency Hotel on East Wacker Drive, assistant professors in black leather pegged pants wade through icy slush. Andrew Ross watches them impassively.

Born in Scotland, Ross is a 34-year-old Marxist scholar of American popular culture who was recently recommended by Princeton's department of English for tenure. A former roustabout on North Sea oil platforms as well as the former butler of the great-grandson of Giuseppe Verdi in Berkeley, Calif., Ross has so far produced three books and 50 articles, his subjects ranging from Batman comics and computer hackers to new-age trance channeling and the semiotics of the Weather Channel.</p><p>For Ross, as for other rising stars in contemporary literary criticism, a good M.L.A. means hurtling between panel and symposium, publishing party and cash bar, seeing and being seen. Tall, lean, with saturnine good looks, Ross attracts attention wherever he goes. "That's him!" comes a reverent whisper from a group of graduate students nearby. "That's Andrew Ross!"</p><p>"M.L.A. is an anxious, exploitative, self-referential universe," Ross says, "but we do get a lot done at these bashes." He straightens his hand-painted Japanese tie, smooths his pale mango wool-and-silk Comme des Garcons blazer ("It's a sendup of the academic male convention of yellow polyester") and checks the wedge-heeled suede lace-ups recently acquired on West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village ("White boy's shoes, worn always with white socks"). Politely sidestepping a clutch of Dante experts, Ross disappears into an elevator, off to present a paper on censorship, Mapplethorpe and 2 Live Crew.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Modern Language Association of America is about scholarly research and hiring, money, power and fashion -- not always in that order. At the most recent convocation, members could choose among a dizzying 2,400 scholarly presentations, including the sedate ("Encyclopedias as a Literary Genre"), the arcane ("Aspects of Iconicity in Some Indiana Hydronyms") and the standing-room-only ("The Sodomitical Tourist"; "Victorian Underwear and Representations of the Female Body"). (A sampler of scholarly papers is on page 57.)</p><p>"Modern language" is a catchall term. Founded in 1883, the M.L.A. currently serves about 30,000 members. A few members are from overseas and rarely attend its meetings. Some join chiefly for the group health insurance. But the vast majority of the association's members teach and do research on literature and language at North America's colleges and universities.</p><p>"Managing M.L.A. gets more complicated all the time," says English Showalter, a professor of French literature at Rutgers University and former executive director of the association. "We recommend standards for the profession on academic freedom, on teaching loads and class sizes, on scholarly editions. There's a multimillion-dollar publishing program and a massive computerized bibliography. And the delegate assembly passes resolutions on everything from imprisoned scholars to fetal-tissue research." M.L.A. publications include bibliographies, teachers' guides and its perennial best seller, "The M.L.A. Handbook," which sets out rules for writing research papers and scholarly articles.</p><p>Two-thirds of the sessions at the annual M.L.A. concern the history, criticism and teaching of English. Similar panels are held on (and in) French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and German. Still other sessions feature what the association terms lesser-taught languages, like Tagalog, Xhosa, Pushtu and Ga.</p><p>As often happens at the M.L.A., this linguistic bounty spawns unending debate. Along the hallways, voices float out from packed meeting rooms expounding on sexual tourism, the pseudo-Jamesian use of allegory, the hermeneutics of suspicion. A session on "materializing culture" inspires a flood of purest critspeak: ". . . for the body commodified,  in rap esthetics, the voyeuristic sampler self is a sound object, continuously metamorphosing, coded, re-tattooed, resignified into designer subjectivities prefiguring our own implosion, volatilizing culture to the point of hysteria and collapse."</p><p>The M.L.A. is the largest, wordiest, most angst-ridden gathering in American arts and letters. "Unlike sociologists, literary scholars don't throw each other in the swimming pool, and they're too politically correct to smoke or drink," one hotel manager explained at a previous convention. "M.L.A.-goers just talk, talk, talk -- then sit in their rooms and cry."</p><p>Small wonder, then, that each year the M.L.A. insures ulcers, decides reputations, shatters and promptly reinvents definitions of literature, language and interpretation in just four frantic days. It also teaches academic combat skills. Tenure-hungry instructors learn to read convention ID badges in one flickering oblique glance (always check the institutional name first) and to compose adroitly venomous queries for the discussion periods that follow the presentation of papers ("What precisely do you mean by that?" can be very effective).</p>                </div>
