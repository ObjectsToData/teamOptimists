                    <p>It is early morning and Constance Elaine Clayton steps briskly from the gilded doors of an empty elevator, her raincoat billowing in her wake. Her staff greets her with a bright "Good morning, Dr. Clayton," before the Superintendent of Philadelphia's public schools, the sixth largest system in the United States, settles into her office, her presence scenting the air with perfume and power.</p><p>For the last eight years, Dr. Clayton has led this school district of nearly 195,000 students through what many Philadelphians call an educational renaissance.</p><p>While the city's public schools are still far from being among the nation's best, a spirit of innovation and greater possibilities pervades schools here. Students' scores on tests based on national norms have improved. Innovative programs have been started to improve the teaching of science, mathematics and the humanities. And a deficit of $78.7 million when Dr. Clayton assumed office in 1982 has been eliminated. The district expects to have an $11 million surplus this fiscal year.</p><p>Along the way, Dr. Clayton, a 53-year-old native Philadelphian, has built a reputation beyond the city, as a sensitive and perceptive educator. She is president-elect of the national Council of Great City Schools, which represents 47 of the nation's largest urban public school systems.  Unusually Long Tenure</p>                </div>

                    <p>Her administration, the first in which Philadelphia's public schools have been led by a black and a woman, has been unusually long and relatively controversy-free for a large urban system.</p><p>Some ascribe her achievements to a combination of an iron will and an iron hand. Others emphasize that she has been masterful in managing to push city politics out of a school bureaucracy that had historically been a ready source of patronage.</p><p>Throughout her tenure, Dr. Clayton has helped to revitalize interest in Philadelphia schools by establishing good relationships with parents and with local business leaders, who have admired her record of sound fiscal management.</p><p>For example, Dr. Clayton's management director, Irv Davis, has told the school board that he expects an $11.2 million surplus this fiscal year, which ends in June.</p><p>But he has also said that his preliminary projection for the next year, using what Dr. Clayton called "a worst-case scneario," was for a deficit of as much as $45 million, depending on scheduled changes in state aid formulas.</p><p>Dr. Clayton said that even with the prospect of a deficit, "I believe the business community will continue to look at this district in terms of its fiscal prudence and management."</p><p>Robert Schwartz, program director for education for the Pew Charitable Trust in Philadelphia, a nationally prominent philanthropic group that earlier awarded the Philadelphia school system $8.3 million this year to help restructure its 22 high schools, said Dr. Clayton's relationship with the business community was unusual.</p><p>"My sense of it is that this relationship here is a very strong one," Mr. Schwartz said. "Fairly typically, there is a honeymoon period in which business lines up to help. What's difficult is sustaining that partnership over a long time." 'A Moral Responsibility'</p><p>Using such partnerships, she has created college access centers that are placed directly in neighborhoods for those who are considering going to college. And she has guided programs that help financially troubled college students receive small emergency grants.</p><p>"Somebody had better step forward and be the advocate for kids," she said, speaking softly yet firmly over the low sound of classical music in her office. "We have a moral reponsibility to these youngsters."</p><p>It is a formidable task. Like most large urban school systems, Philadelphia's is charged with educating an increasingly poor and troubled student body. Yet, despite school facades of broken bricks and peeling paint, more students than not believe they can achieve, many Philadelphians say.</p><p>"She came at a time when the district was in dire straits, both fiscally and educationally," said Herman Mattleman, a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia who until last fall was president of the city's school board. "She was the center of an important turnaround. She's a bright lady, determined and a good educator."</p><p>But Mr. Mattleman refused to discuss why he quit the board last year after leading it for seven years. Philadelphia newspapers, citing his friends and colleagues, reported at the time that Mr. Mattleman had left out of frustration with the "dictatorial" manner in which Dr. Clayton managed the school district.</p><p>Thomas A. Mills, a school board member who is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has no such hestitation. "She is very abrasive, very imperial and very aloof" he said in a recent telephone interview.</p><p>Most galling to him, he said, is what he called Dr. Clayton's tendency to skirt responsibility for what goes wrong and her "great alacrity" in accepting the credit for anything that goes right.</p><p>Even her most ardent supporters say Dr. Clayton suffers from a crusader's complex in which she does not welcome criticism of the system she is laboring 14 hours a day to save and improve. But the president of the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Sheldon Hackney, a strong supporter of the Superintendent, said he had noticed a softening in Dr. Clayton's tone and manner in recent years.</p><p>"She has a very strong personality and you have to take that with the pluses and minuses," he said. "She's very tough and I admire that."</p>                </div>
