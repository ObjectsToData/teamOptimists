                    <p>SOMETHING LEATHER    By Alasdair Gray. 256 pp. New York: Random House.</p><p>Remember the tale of the Three Little Pigs? Two uninspired ones built houses out of straw and sticks, only to have them huffed and puffed into oblivion by the Big Bad Wolf. The third, much more creative, made his of brick and so provided the shelter that kept his rasher buddies from becoming the wolf's breakfast bacon. Imagine the first two, however, not only hiding out in that sturdier domicile but also booting up the third pig's Macintosh to grind out a treatise defending the continued building of straw and stick houses in areas populated by blowhard wolves. If you can conceive of such a writing project, you are ready for "Something Leather."</p><p>The publisher clearly labels Alasdair Gray's book a novel, so the reader has the right to expect such. Or so one would think. Yet it is not many pages before one must ask oneself just what is going on here. Mr. Gray has a reputation for experimental fiction, to be sure, but "Something Leather" challenges even the most liberal definition of the genre. By the time the reader has endured all but the epilogue, it is probable that annoyance will not only have set in but will have taken firm hold.</p><p>"Critic-Fuel: An Epilogue" is, then, just that -- fuel. Not fuel for stimulation of thought but rather fuel to ignite annoyance into a much larger conflagration. Anger, perhaps. Mr. Gray here explains everything that motivated him to write the previous 230 pages. Put succinctly, he says he had been pressed for several years by a publisher to turn out a new book. Nothing was happening, and he needed money. He resurrected a short story that had already been rejected by editors of popular magazines who had once shown sympathy for his work and sent it to the book publisher, who paid him a substantial advance. That tale, retitled "One for the Album," is essentially the first chapter of the current "novel."</p>                </div>

                    <p>As he tried to extend it, he found that the story would not go anywhere. This is not surprising, to me at least. Where    is    a plot about "a modest, conventional woman" working in Glasgow, who suddenly decides to go to the office totally bald and dressed in leather clothing, likely to get? Not far. So, admitting this, Mr. Gray doubled back, split into two parts the original short story about how she got (a) bald and (b) leather-clad, and filled in-between with almost totally unrelated chapters about various Glaswegians reflecting on war, politics, marriage, sex, you name it. And where did Mr. Gray get    these    chapters? By his own admission, the same place he got the story of the bald woman: out of the drawer with his other unpublished stories, unstaged plays and long-ago-produced radio and television scripts.</p><p>Mr. Gray, who has published some very creditable works of fiction, shamelessly admits to absolutely everything in his epilogue. At times I felt he was chiding me for having sat through all this. He even says that, in retrospect, he probably mistitled the book: "I now wish I had called it 'Glaswegians.' " Would that he had. I might therefore not have been so misdirected by a bald woman legal adviser, who, if not involved in much of a plot, is a distracting concept nonetheless.</p><p>Other critics have been offended by what they believe to be Mr. Gray's "pornography" -- material certainly in evidence here. Even Anthony Burgess, who called his "Lanark" one of the best 99 novels since World War II, found his "1982 Janine" much more problematical in this regard. "Something Leather," not to be outdone, contains a good deal of sadomasochism, a headmistress teaching a young girl to masturbate and ritual bondage in which a beautiful woman is shaved of all the hair on her body and then tattooed by the women who tied her up -- not to mention wasps placed all over her flesh just to make it more titillating. Then these same women steal all her clothes, leaving her little more than the leather skirt she thoughtlessly bought in the first chapter, before she had a clue as to what her purchase would get her into.</p><p>Now, I could handle this if the author were guiding it all toward some thematic point. But Mr. Gray seems to me to have no place to go with it. It is gratuitous, the outpouring of his imagination without the form of art to shape and control it.</p><p>Such is the stuff of authorial self-indulgence. Equally self-indulgent are Mr. Gray's instructions, again in the epilogue, as to what it all was supposed to have meant, what I as the reader just might have missed. He even provides a chronology that shows which years between 1963 and 1989 each chapter actually took place in. He also tells us which of his four heroines (June, Donalda, Senga and Harriet) was the central figure in each chapter, even though most of the time that character has barely surfaced in the chapter -- that is, in the short story or script he had pulled from his file drawer of rejected or out-of-date manuscripts. The four women themselves are on stage so rarely and so inconsistently that they virtually never engage the reader's identification.</p><p>And on the matter of self-indulgence, there is also the characters' dialect and dialogue. Mr. Gray sometimes seems to spell out phonetically virtually every word his characters speak, accurately I am sure, but to the utter distraction of the reader trying to concentrate on other matters -- plot, character development and theme.</p><p>Taken on their own, some of the interior chapters have artistry and merit. I particularly liked the reflections on war in one titled "In the Boiler Room" and the comical friction caused by the divergent life styles of boarders in "Quiet People." As short stories, some are quite fine. I would recommend the reader take them as such, even though Mr. Gray insists they are part of a novel.</p><p>The weakest passages in the book, however, are the chapters about the bald leather-skirted woman, the very ones that supposedly unify "Something Leather" and give it literary purpose. They are rather the straw and sticks that house the four characters; and what bricks there are are strewn about the interior, supporting the edifice not very much at all.</p>                </div>
