Samuel, a music professor and the university's music librarian cites the quote with pride, noting that with that reputation, the Yale Music Library has become a magnet for manuscripts dating from the Middle Ages to the present. The collection includes original works by Bach, Thomson, Kurt Weill, Charles Ives and Paul Hindemith, as well as an extensive group of arrangements and recordings donated to the library by Benny Goodman.   &quot;As soon as word got around that we were in the archival business, many opportunities opened up,&quot; said the 66-year-old Mr. Samuel, known around campus as Sam. &quot;People contacted us.

                    <p>"YALE knows how to take care of manuscripts," the composer Virgil Thomson once said. Howard E. Samuel, a music professor and the university's music librarian cites the quote with pride, noting that with that reputation, the Yale Music Library has become a magnet for manuscripts dating from the Middle Ages to the present. The collection includes original works by Bach, Thomson, Kurt Weill, Charles Ives and Paul Hindemith, as well as an extensive group of arrangements and recordings donated to the library by Benny Goodman.</p><p>"As soon as word got around that we were in the archival business, many opportunities opened up," said the 66-year-old Mr. Samuel, known around campus as Sam. "People contacted us. It grew by leaps and bounds."</p><p>While Yale had been amassing music material since 1850, Mr. Samuel's arrival in 1972 heralded the beginning of the formal music archives with detailed cataloguing of the contents.</p><p>"Yale Music Library had a very good rare book collection and a very limited budget," Mr. Samuel said. "I knew I wouldn't be able to significantly increase the rare books," so he decided to concentrate on other materials. "My assistant and I went to the university archives and studied archival methods," he said. "We became the music branch of the Yale University archives." Since then, the university's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library has lent the cramped music library two floors for its holdings.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In addition to the manuscripts, which are valuable because they give clues to the process of composition, the music library is interested in material from famous performers, he said.  All That Jazz</p><p>"Photographs, programs, reviews, recordings both private and commercial -- these are the categories of material we're interested in," said Mr. Samuel, seated in his cluttered office surrounded by stacks of memorabilia, including a carved music stand that once belonged to the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, whose papers and recordings the library is currently processing.</p><p>The music archives are particularly strong in 20th-century American composers, like Ives, Thomson and Hindemith, and German composers and scholars between the World Wars, including Kurt Weill and Franz Schreker, his teacher. The library also has a large jazz collection, including the archives of John Hammond, the jazz promoter and record producer, materials from the bandleader Ted Lewis and the bassist Slam Stewart and photographs of black jazz musicians compiled by the critic Stanley Dance. But the cornerstone of the jazz holdings are those from Goodman, whose bequest to the library included his clarinet.</p><p>Mr. Samuel said he first met Goodman when the bandleader received an honorary doctorate from Yale.</p><p>"I suggested the possibility of establishing the Benny Goodman Archives," the librarian said. "He didn't say no."</p><p>After several conversations, "in December 1985, he gave us about 30 arrangements done by Fletcher Henderson," Mr. Samuel said. "I suspected that Benny wanted to see what we would do with them. We catalogued the dickens out of them, and then sent the catalogues to him.</p><p>"Sometime around May 1986, his lawyer called me and said, 'Benny and I want to come up and visit you, just a social visit.' In June, I wisely invited the university librarian to have lunch with us. I made a reservation at Mory's," the famous campus eating club.</p><p>"We had a private room. When the waiters learned that Benny Goodman was there, they ran home, got their records and brought them back for his autograph." Goodman died three days after that luncheon visit. In his will, he left the library all 400 of his master tapes and all 1,500 of his arrangements as well as related material.</p><p>Goodman also left Yale the rights to reproduce the tapes, "because he knew there was material in the tapes that could be released," Mr. Samuel said. "We could realize some royalty income to help with the large expense of processing and servicing his extensive archives. From his apartment in New York and his house in Stamford, we brought in five truckloads of material."</p><p>In 1988, the Yale Music Library brought out its first volume of previously unreleased recordings from Goodman's private collection on cassettes, records and compact disks. The songs, recorded in the 50's and 60's, included "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face," "Them There Eyes" and "More Than You Know." Four more volumes followed, with the sixth due in May and the seventh in October. Three more volumes will complete the series, Mr. Samuel said.</p><p>To initiate the recording project, "I had to borrow a lot of money," Mr. Samuel said. "I had to hire an authority to go through the tapes to determine what had already been released and what was worthy of being released. Then I had to pay a recording engineer."  Boxes in the Hall</p><p>The cost "has run into six figures," he said. "The royalties are finally nearing that number. More important than the money is he's still alive."</p><p>Mr. Samuel noted that the average cost of cataloguing a collection from one source is $18,000 but has risen as high as $50,000.</p><p>"We don't have a budget for processing," he said. "I've had to scrounge around for money. We've had grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, and quite often the composer or the composer's family will help us."</p><p>Processing is not a glamorous business, nor a quick one, Mr. Samuel said, leading a visitor through the stacks of the music library, past music scores, to a tight spiral staircase that descends to the basement and three locked air-conditioned rooms that house manuscripts, photographs, tapes and items of memorabilia awaiting processing.</p><p>The precious collections are stowed in acid-free folders and boxes on metal shelves. But a great many boxes sit in the corridor, awaiting processing. Clearly, the library is bursting at the seams.</p><p>"We outgrew it 20 years ago," Mr. Samuel said. "We are in desperate need of new quarters."</p><p>The university's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., has commissioned the design for a new music library building from the architect Cesar Pelli. The cost of the project, which is scheduled for completion in 1994, is $15 million, Mr. Samuel said; so far, about one-third has been given or pledged.</p><p>As the archives grow, interesting comparisons between the holdings are possible.</p><p>"I was preparing an exhibit of Carl Maria von Weber's 'Invitation to the Dance,' and something occurred to me," Mr. Samuel said. "Weber's piece was the basis of Benny Goodman's theme song, 'Let's Dance.' I pulled the alto sax part and Weber's original melody and displayed them together. That's my favorite overlap."</p><p>Photos: Harold E. Samuel, left, Yale University's music librarian, in the university's Benny Goodman Archives.
