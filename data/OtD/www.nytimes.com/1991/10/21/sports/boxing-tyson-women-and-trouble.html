Just as his extraordinary boxing skills afforded him the means to accumulate other exotic cars -- Rolls-Royces, Jaguars and Lamborghinis -- so too did they provide a succession of chances to meet women in numbers beyond even his own expectations.</p><p>But Tyson's relations with women have repetitively brought complications and unwelcome headlines. As one incident followed another -- ranging from a charge that he strongarmed a kiss from a parking-lot attendant in Los Angeles in 1987 to the accusation a year later that he beat his wife, the actress Robin Givens -- questions began to be raised about Tyson.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Has he been a sexual aggressor with a compulsion for taking advantage of women, as some have charged? Or has Tyson been, as he and his supporters assert, a victim rather than the victimizer, a celebrity whose wealth and fame have made him a target for women seeking money, notoriety or both?</p><p>These questions have taken on greater interest since Sept. 9, when a grand jury in Marion County, Ind., indicted Tyson on charges that he raped an 18-year-old woman, who was a contestant at the Miss Black America pageant in Indianapolis in July. Tyson has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>The indictment came only two months before Tyson was scheduled to fight in the biggest match of his career, against the undisputed heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, on Nov. 8. That bout will now apparently be fought in January -- despite the fact that the trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 27 -- because of a rib-cage injury that forced Tyson's camp to request a postponement last Friday.</p><p>But whatever the interest in Tyson's future in the ring, and it's certainly still considerable, the indictment has made the fighter's personal behavior with women -- often a private matter for athletes or other public figures -- an even greater issue of public attention.</p><p>In fact, on the day Tyson was indicted, the Marion County prosecutor, Jeffrey Modisett, made it clear that in the trial, he will rummage through the 25-year-old fighter's social past in building a case against him. "It is quite possible that other aspects of his behavior will become very relevant in the case," Modisett said. A Group of Complaints</p><p>In an attempt to show that Tyson was a man out of control, the prosecutors seem likely to concentrate on the day and a half leading up to the early morning hours of July 19, when the woman contends that Tyson raped her in his room at the Canterbury Hotel.</p><p>The prosecution could call as witnesses a number of the pageant's contestants -- reportedly as many as 10 -- as well as a past winner. Some of these women claim to have been victims of physical approaches by Tyson in Indianapolis. Their allegations are at the heart of a $21 million suit filed against the fighter and others by the organizer of the Miss Black America pageant, J. Morris Anderson, whose legal brief provided the description of Tyson as a "serial buttocks fondler."</p><p>Rosie Jones, Miss Black America of 1990, told reporters that Tyson not only touched her buttocks, but also whispered "perverted things about sex" and then laughed at her when she objected. She has filed a $100 million lawsuit against Tyson in Federal court in Manhattan. It is pending.</p><p>"He shouldn't go around touching people and doing what he wants just because he's Mike Tyson," Jones was quoted as saying in Newsday.</p><p>But it's precisely because he is Iron Mike Tyson -- two-fisted destroyer in the prize ring -- that he has intrigued the public. A larger-than-life figure, Tyson has made gaffes that range from minor news notes to lurid tales played out over weeks in tabloids and on television. Consider just a few examples:</p><p>*Tyson was quoted by a former fighter and one-time confidant, Jose Torres, as saying that the best punch he ever threw was one he landed on Givens, whom he was separated from in late 1988 and divorced from in 1989. Tyson later denied saying this.</p><p>*On receiving an honorary doctorate of humanities degree at Central State University in Ohio in 1989, the fighter told his audience: "I don't know what kind of doctor I am, but watching all these beautiful sisters here, I'm debating whether I should be a gynecologist."</p><p>*In 1987, he ended up paying $105,000 as part of a settlement for his parking-lot kiss. Ever since, he has been the object of lawsuits filed by women on both coasts. Some of them have been settled and some are still pending.</p><p>The latest is an $11 million paternity and palimony suit filed by Natalie Fears, the mother of his 17-month-old son, D'Amato, one of two children Tyson has acknowledged fathering. One of Tyson's lawyers, Bob Hirth, called the suit frivolous, and said Tyson had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars for the child's support and generous financial assistance to the mother.
