                    <p>AFTER two years of living like academic nomads, the students and teachers of Nightingale-Bamford, a private girls' school on Manhattan's Upper East Side, are home again.</p><p>When the 1991-92 school year began last month, they returned to their 62-year-old, Georgian-styled schoolhouse at 20 East 92d Street after a $22 million expansion and renovation of the building. While the work was going on they held classes and ate lunch in 17 neighboring schools, churches, synagogues and community centers.</p><p>"We were trying to meet educational needs of the 20th and 21st century with a building from the 1920's and having a harder and harder time doing it," said Ann McChord, director of administration for the school, which has 475 students from kindergarten through grade 12. "To make the kinds of improvements we wanted, we had to leave the building. The work could not go on around us."</p><p>Nightingale-Bamford is not alone in its decision to put students and staff through the agonies of a reconstruction. By a rough count, New York City's private, or independent schools, as they prefer to be called, are spending more than $75 million on ongoing and recently completed improvement projects.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Spence School, at 22 East 91st Street, spent $7.2 million on its expansion and upgrading and the Chapin School, at 100 East End Avenue, at 84th Street, spent $8 million. The Dalton School, which owns several buildings on the Upper East Side, this month began a campaign to raise $27 million for a new gymnasium and other capital improvements.</p><p>On the West Side, the Calhoun School three years ago bought a building at 160 West 74th Street from the defunct Baldwin League School and then put $7 million into renovating the building for its preschool, kindergarten and first grade.</p><p>In the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, the Berkeley Carroll School expects to complete in January a $5 million renovation and expansion of its upper and middle school building on Lincoln Place.</p><p>All this construction activity has put the schools in the improbable role of real estate developers. Administrators, trustees and parent volunteers have found themselves struggling with zoning and planning issues, pleading their cases before community boards and working with architects, contractors and construction companies to see the projects through to completion. With a few exceptions the schools are not creating new space to expand enrollment, nor are they anticipating a rush of applicants. Rather, they are upgrading to meet the changing needs of their students and putting money into more sophisticated science laboratories, expanded room for computer studies, new gymnasiums, larger cafeterias and libraries and more spacious and comfortable work areas for teachers.</p><p>Competition for students plays a major role in the decision to modernize.</p><p>"The main point, of course," said Dr. Gardner Dunnan, headmaster of the Dalton School, "is to improve educational programs. But schools also want to be sure that their science, math and computer programs are up to the other institutions." He said that in analyzing its strengths and weaknesses, Dalton had found it was not as strong in math and science as in the humanities.</p><p>Mildred Berendsen, headmistress of the Chapin School, said that the improvements in the girls schools are one way that they can reaffirm their commitment to science, math and physical education studies for young women.</p><p>"They have always been important," she said, "but they demand special spaces. When you create those spaces you are making a statement about the content of the education you provide and the environment for students and teachers."</p><p>In the last few years, several independent schools in New York City have closed or merged. This unsettling trend has even prestigious and generously endowed schools looking over their shoulders.</p><p>"We are not anticipating a major expansion of the applicant pool," said Frederick Calder, director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, half of whose 138 member schools are in New York City.</p><p>"New York City will hold its own," he said. "But we are not looking for the kind of growth we saw in the 60's and 70's, largely because the students are not there."</p><p>Brooklyn is an exception, Mr. Calder said. In that borough, independent school enrollment is still increasing.</p><p>What makes these ambitious rebuilding plans all the more challenging is that the money to pay for them must come, for the most part, from parents and alumni. Moreover, they are being undertaken at a time when the schools are coping with not only a shrinking pool of potential applicants but also rising operating costs and a faltering national and local economy that is straining the budgets of some parents. Annual tuition ranges from about $9,000 to $11,000.</p><p>Still, many schools have no other choice.</p><p>By the time construction started at Nightingale-Bamford, space was so tight that hallways had been pressed into service for computer study and for book storage from an overflowing library. Lunch was starting at 10:30 A.M. so that everyone in the school could be fed, and the auditorium was doing double duty as a gymnasium.</p>                </div>
