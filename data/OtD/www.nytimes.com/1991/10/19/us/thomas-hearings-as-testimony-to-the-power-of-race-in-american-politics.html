The particulars were new -- a black conservative defended by Southern white Senators. But in its imagery, in the emotions it engendered and in the way both blacks and whites reacted, the fight over Judge Thomas's nomination was a stark evocation of the eerie continuity and the startling power of race in American life and politics.">

But in its imagery, in the emotions it engendered and in the way both blacks and whites reacted, the fight over Judge Thomas's nomination was a stark evocation of the eerie continuity and the startling power of race in American life and politics.</p><p>"When you put all the hot buttons out in front of you, clearly race is the one that's white hot," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic political consultant.  Flux in Race Relations</p><p>The furor, particularly the emotion-packed Senate hearings last weekend, reflected much of the flux in the nation's race relations. Not only was the Thomas nomination salvaged by white Southerners, who were clearly concerned with the power of the black vote, but it also presented television audiences -- perhaps for the first time -- with a view of cadres of conservative black professionals very different from the general stereotypes of blacks.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But beneath the surface, the emotions engendered were so familiar as to be almost primal.</p><p>For blacks, there was a solid show of support for an embattled black man, even one assailed as an enemy of civil rights, that reinforced the degree to which blacks have behaved as a unified political force.</p><p>For whites, there was a melodrama in which a black man was seen as either a long-suffering figure assaulted on all sides or Willie Horton in a suit and tie -- a division that mirrors the traditional racial iconography of the South.</p><p>For the nation, there was the reminder that racial politics remain the most emotionally charged divide, one that is so powerful that a black conservative critical of the civil rights agenda could raise the specter of racism and the Democrats questioning him were all but silenced.</p><p>There was also the reminder that more than three decades after the beginning of the civil rights revolution in the South, the racial dilemmas that once haunted the South now play the same role nationally.</p><p>"The role that blacks play today is the role they have always played in the South," said Joel Williamson, a humanities professor at the University of North Carolina who is the author of "The Crucible of Race: Black-White Relations in the South Since Emancipation" (Oxford University Press, 1984). "If you just look at the black and white bodies and their mutual proximity to one another, there's been a revolution. But if you look at ideas, opinions and notions, if you push it out toward the subconscious, very little has changed."</p><p>In some ways, the Thomas nomination, the hearings and the vote helped destroy the idea of a monolithic black community. Instead, Judge Thomas's conservative views and the savvy black professionals who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, provided a rare view of the philosophical and economic diversity among blacks.</p><p>But most striking may have been the way that many black Americans vigorously supported Judge Thomas, who characterized the hearings as a "high-tech lynching," a comparison that was later derided by members of Congressional Black Caucus.</p><p>Roger Wilkins, a longtime civil rights figure who teaches at George Mason University, attributed part of the support to the degree to which most blacks were unaware of the specifics of what he termed Judge Thomas's "hideous record of attacking civil rights remedies and civil rights leaders."</p><p>But he also saw a deep-rooted and instinctive reaction of blacks who saw a common interest in defending one of their own.</p><p>"Blacks have been terribly deprived throughout our history and we've been deprived among other things of symbols of pride occupying high places," he said. "So that when a black is presented for such a position there is an instinctive reaction to support that person."</p><p>That was the clear view on Auburn Avenue here, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born, and where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference he headed and the civil rights center named for him stand.</p><p>Here, in one of the spiritual meccas of the civil rights movement, there was overwhelming support for Judge Thomas, more often in spite of his philosophy than because of it.</p><p>"How can a black man be a conservative?" asked Marquette DeCuir, shaking his head in disgust as he and a small group of men discussed the Thomas affair near the shoeshine stand at the Fashion Dry Cleaners.</p><p>But, that said, he voiced his wholehearted support of Judge Thomas, to the unanimous assent of the other men on hand. "Of course, I'm going to support a black man," he said. "I don't care who he is."</p><p>In their recent book, "Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights and Taxes on American Politics," (W. W. Norton, 1991) Thomas Byrne Edsall and Mary D. Edsall argue that racial issues, explicit and subterranean, have torn apart the old Democratic coalition and driven whites toward the Republican Party. It is a process that mimics the traditional politics of the South.</p><p>Professor Williamson says much of the racial psychology of the South is also being played out on a national level. Much like the world depicted in Ralph Ellison's classic novel, "Invisible Man," he said, whites had never been able to see blacks as people but rather as stereotypes. He said throughout history Southerners had seen blacks as either devils or angels -- either beloved field hands and docile country folk or as rapacious animals.</p><p>In the Thomas hearings, before a transfixed nation, Judge Thomas was transformed into both, with a power clearly exacerbated by race, he said.</p><p>But Professor Williamson said integration, however limited and often painful, was also producing a quiet transformation. "The one bright element is this business of physical integration," he said. "We're getting better generation by generation, but I think we have several hundred years to go."</p><p>Whatever the case, few people expect race to recede as a national issue.</p><p>"I think it will continue to heat up," Professor Wilkins said. "When we're in uncertain economic times, white people become insecure and frightened, and they look around for scapegoats. The racial advances we've had usually have come in times of economic expansion, when people feel good about themselves. I don't think the American people are going to feel very optimistic for some time to come."</p>                </div>
