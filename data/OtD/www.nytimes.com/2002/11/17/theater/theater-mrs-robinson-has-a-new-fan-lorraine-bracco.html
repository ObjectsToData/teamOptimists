JENNIFER MELFI, a k a Lorraine Bracco, is sitting on a couch, relaxed and casual in light pink turtleneck, gray sweat pants and red-striped white sneakers. But this isn't the set of ''The Sopranos,'' where Ms. Bracco portrays Dr. Melfi, the quiet and conservative psychiatrist for the New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano. It is the Plymouth Theater, where on Tuesday Ms. Bracco will make her Broadway debut, replacing Kathleen Turner as Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate.''    ''I wanted a challenge,'' Ms. Bracco says. ''This will be my Ph.D. in acting. Dr. Melfi is the last big role I kind of created, and I've been getting a little comfortable. I'm not at all bored with her, because I think the writing is extraordinary, but I thought it was about time I jumped. I'm old enough to jump.''  ">

                    <p>DR. JENNIFER MELFI, a k a Lorraine Bracco, is sitting on a couch, relaxed and casual in light pink turtleneck, gray sweat pants and red-striped white sneakers. But this isn't the set of ''The Sopranos,'' where Ms. Bracco portrays Dr. Melfi, the quiet and conservative psychiatrist for the New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano. It is the Plymouth Theater, where on Tuesday Ms. Bracco will make her Broadway debut, replacing Kathleen Turner as Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate.''</p><p>''I wanted a challenge,'' Ms. Bracco says. ''This will be my Ph.D. in acting. Dr. Melfi is the last big role I kind of created, and I've been getting a little comfortable. I'm not at all bored with her, because I think the writing is extraordinary, but I thought it was about time I jumped. I'm old enough to jump.''</p><p>Ms. Bracco, who turned 47 last month, has often described herself as spontaneous, loud and rowdy. During the interview, she hinted at those aspects of her personality, sprinkling her responses with jovial-sounding variations of a four-letter obscenity. In the late 90's, during a court battle with her former husband Harvey Keitel over custody of their daughter, Stella, she was reported to have greeted Mr. Keitel in a Rockland County courtroom with an obscene gesture (though she said in the interview that she doesn't remember doing it). ''If I remember correctly, I think I said to the judge that we should just all go out for margaritas,'' Ms. Bracco declared.</p><p>So it is perhaps not surprising that one reason she is ''thrilled'' to be in ''The Graduate'' is that she considers Mrs. Robinson ''somebody I can get rowdy with.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Mrs. Robinson is a great American icon,'' Ms. Bracco said. ''She is exciting, shocking, miserable, angry, desperate -- and a hell of a lot of fun to play. I guess a good way to put it is that she's a hoot. She's a piece of work, a very complicated woman. She's self-loathing. I understand her frustration and her desperation, with her marriage and her child. I like that she has a palette of colors, and that she's not pastelly. You're not going to pick out pretty in pink for Mrs. Robinson. And she's true to herself. I love her for that.''</p><p>The nudity in the role -- a brief, dimly lighted bedroom scene with the character Benjamin Braddock (played by John Lavelle), the friends' son whom Mrs. Robinson seduces -- doesn't faze her, she said: ''It's part of the character. It's part of her need to seduce, her way of getting Benjamin to pay attention to her.''</p><p>Mr. Lavelle takes over on Tuesday from Jason Biggs, who is leaving at the same time as Ms. Turner. The play -- adapted and directed by Terry Johnson and based on the novel by Charles Webb and the screenplay by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry -- opened in early April to generally lackluster reviews. But it has done well at the box office and its producers are hoping that Ms. Bracco's fame from ''The Sopranos'' will provide the star power that Ms. Turner brought to the role.</p><p>Ms. Bracco said that in a couple of ways, she is very much like Mrs. Robinson. ''She gets what she wants,'' the actress said. ''I will work hard for what I want. I'll put in the hours, whatever it takes. And she's truthful. She is brutally honest. I have been unfortunately called that myself.''</p><p>Her frankness -- and her sense of humor -- are apparent when she is asked about the flap last month over the Columbus Day parade in New York City. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a longtime friend -- they met because their daughters ride horses -- invited her and a ''Sopranos'' colleague, Dominic Chianese, to march with him. The mayor cited their public-service work -- Ms. Bracco is on the board of Riverkeeper, an environmental organization, and the New York Council for the Humanities. But parade organizers, unhappy with the way Italian-Americans are portrayed on the HBO series, refused to let the actors march. So the mayor, Ms. Bracco and Mr. Chianese -- who plays Uncle Junior -- stayed away from the parade and instead lunched at an Italian restaurant in the Bronx.</p><p>''How do I answer without embarrassing my friend the mayor?'' she said. Then she was silent for a moment. ''I'm glad I live in a country where everybody is entitled to their opinion,'' she continued. ''That said, I think most people understand that I'm an actor creating a role.''</p><p>She smiled. ''If someone has a hard time separating that from the person, maybe they should go see Dr. Phil,'' that other television therapist, she said. ''Because I'm very busy seeing Tony Soprano and all my other clients in my practice in New Jersey.''</p><p>Ms. Bracco is the third ''Sopranos'' actress to take advantage of the hiatus in filming the series -- shooting for the fifth season begins in February -- to appear on Broadway this fall. Edie Falco, who plays Tony's wife, is starring in ''Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,'' and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Tony's daughter, is portraying Belle in ''Beauty and the Beast.''</p><p>Ms. Bracco was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island; her father worked in the Fulton Fish Market. In school, her classmates on the bus voted her the ugliest girl in sixth grade. ''It was something that definitely marked me,'' she said. ''I was very hurt. I remember crawling into my father's lap and crying, saying I don't ever want to go to school again. But my father said the magic words -- 'You're the most beautiful girl in the world to me' -- and then gave me a pat on the shoulder and said, 'You'll be in school tomorrow at 9.' ''</p><p>Her father was more accurate than her schoolmates. As a teenager, Ms. Bracco became a fashion model, and she spent a decade working in Paris. ''People just kept pushing me, saying I could model,'' she recalled. ''I had an English teacher, Mr. Horowitz, who took me into the city to meet with Wilhelmina'' -- the head of a leading modeling agency -- ''and she took me right then and there.''</p><p>Her transition to acting, she said, was slow and painful: ''It took what seemed a lifetime. I made a movie in France, and I hated it. I was bored by the whole process. It only became interesting after I met Harvey Keitel and returned here. Harvey taught me what an actor does, how it works. I sat in the Actors Studio behind him for a year a half, two years, until I said, 'I think I can do that.' ''</p><p>In 1991, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as a Mafia wife in ''Goodfellas.'' But her career didn't take off. Much of the 90's consisted of unexciting roles in unmemorable films, combined with unpleasant publicity from her successful custody fight, a battle whose legal costs led her to file for bankruptcy in 1999. (She and her most recent husband, the actor Edward James Olmos, are divorced.)</p><p>''You have to make a choice,'' she said. ''I was troubled with the separation from Harvey, and I had two kids at home'' -- Stella and Margaux, her daughter from her first marriage, to a French actor, Daniel Guerard -- ''who needed Mommy. I remember asking myself, 'What is it you want?' I said I could have a great career -- there were a lot of roles I didn't take, for a while I just kind of worked to pay the mortgage -- or do I want good kids, do I want a family life? I decided I wanted kids I was proud of. And I look at them now, and I'm proud and happy. They make my heart sing.''</p><p>''The Sopranos,'' of course, was ''a big turning point.''</p><p>''It allowed me to put myself back on my feet,'' she said. ''It gave me a lot of confidence, so now I can challenge myself and do something like this.''</p><p>''Success is not just money in the bank and Emmy nominations and Oscars,'' said Ms. Bracco, who was nominated for Emmy Awards in each of the first three ''Sopranos'' seasons. ''Sure, I would like to win those things. But I'm invited to the party every year. I'm in the room when they're giving out the Emmys. So I can't complain. It's not really a bad place to be at my age.''</p><p>The Graduate</p><p>Plymouth Theater, 236 West 45th Street.</p><p>Photo: Lorraine Bracco in costume as Mrs. Robinson.
