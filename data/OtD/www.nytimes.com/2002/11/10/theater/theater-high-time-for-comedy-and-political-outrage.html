One of the critical texts we read was an essay by the esteemed Canadian critic Northrop Frye, who, in discussing classical stage comedy, distinguished between what he called ''Old Comedy,'' typified in the works of Aristophanes, and the ''New Comedy'' of Menander, whose plays were produced almost a century later.    In Old Comedy, there is normally an idealistic, if somewhat foolish, protagonist who challenges the status quo in some ultimate way, by inhibiting sacrifices to the gods, or by entering Hades to retrieve a dead poet, or by persuading the women of Athens to go on a sex strike. The motive of these well-meaning heroes or heroines is usually to bring some special good to the city of Athens, which was then involved in what seemed like an interminable war with Sparta. Most of the protagonists in these Old Comedies succeed triumphantly, bringing peace and prosperity to their beleaguered polis, even though in actual fact Athens was ultimately to lose the Peloponnesian war.

In Old Comedy, there is normally an idealistic, if somewhat foolish, protagonist who challenges the status quo in some ultimate way, by inhibiting sacrifices to the gods, or by entering Hades to retrieve a dead poet, or by persuading the women of Athens to go on a sex strike. The motive of these well-meaning heroes or heroines is usually to bring some special good to the city of Athens, which was then involved in what seemed like an interminable war with Sparta.

One of the critical texts we read was an essay by the esteemed Canadian critic Northrop Frye, who, in discussing classical stage comedy, distinguished between what he called ''Old Comedy,'' typified in the works of Aristophanes, and the ''New Comedy'' of Menander, whose plays were produced almost a century later.</p><p>In Old Comedy, there is normally an idealistic, if somewhat foolish, protagonist who challenges the status quo in some ultimate way, by inhibiting sacrifices to the gods, or by entering Hades to retrieve a dead poet, or by persuading the women of Athens to go on a sex strike. The motive of these well-meaning heroes or heroines is usually to bring some special good to the city of Athens, which was then involved in what seemed like an interminable war with Sparta. Most of the protagonists in these Old Comedies succeed triumphantly, bringing peace and prosperity to their beleaguered polis, even though in actual fact Athens was ultimately to lose the Peloponnesian war.</p><p>These plays are also characterized by the way they reach out to the audience with specific political and personal praise or criticism, naming names, accusing or complimenting political or military leaders and reminding audiences of their civic responsibilities. Furthermore, there are beautiful musical interludes, sung by the chorus, envisioning a better world.</p><p>New Comedy, on the other hand, is much more localized and realistic. (''O Life and Menander, which of you copied the other?'' a third-century critic wrote.) The focus here shifts from the city to the family, and the plays tend to take place on streets in front of private houses. Their plots normally deal with domestic issues, like money and marriage. There are rigid authority figures, normally parents, who must be accommodated, witty and wily slaves who help engineer the plot, and sometimes long-lost children who show up just in time for a happy ending.</p>                </div>

                    <p>While not much of Menander's work has survived, he has had far more influence on subsequent stage comedy than Aristophanes. Most Roman comedy is derived from Menander, and of course Moli&egrave;re, Congreve, Sheridan, on through to Neil Simon, are indebted to him. Many television sitcoms display strong elements of New Comedy.</p><p>On the other hand, usually in times of trouble, the occasional Old Comedy re-emerges. There are echoes of the form in some of George Bernard Shaw's work, like ''Major Barbara,'' and in the occasional American musical, like ''Of Thee I Sing'' or ''Hair.'' (Most of Shakespeare's comedies deserve a special category of their own, which Frye described as ''Green World Comedy.'') In any case, since comedy is such a complicated and elusive endeavor, these attempts to pin it down can sometimes be illuminating.</p><p>In 1992, about 10 years after I had pretty much quit teaching at M.I.T, and a year or two after I had confined myself within the New Comedy tradition with a play called ''The Cocktail Hour,'' I found myself trying to stretch into a more open form. The Bush-Clinton election was then well under way, and I tried to respond to it with something I called ''The Fourth Wall.'' The play had a quixotic, idealistic heroine, a certain amount of political editorializing and even some choral interludes, since the characters occasionally sang selections from Cole Porter. In my more academic moments, I flattered myself into thinking I was slipping into the Aristophanic vein of Old Comedy.</p><p>No matter how you characterize the play, over the next couple of years it was produced in various places and various times with varied success. It infuriated the Republicans in the audiences at the Westport Country Playhouse, irritated the critics when it set down in Cambridge, Mass., and generally pleased audiences when it showed up in Chicago.</p><p>After Bill Clinton was elected, I adjusted its political commentary to apply to his fledgling administration, but some of the juice began to seep out of the play. No matter where it was done, I can't say that it won the praise and prizes that Aristophanes won, in the annual spring festivals of Athens, with his raw, passionate, aggressively political Old Comedies.</p><p>Another few years went by. In the summer of 2001, after George W. Bush had entered the White House, I began to write another play with a political theme. Halfway through, I started to feel that I was repeating myself. I returned to ''The Fourth Wall,'' which by then had long been out and around. I found I could rewrite it fairly drastically to apply to the current political scene. I sent it to Casey Childs, the executive producer of Primary Stages, who presides over an Off Broadway theater with a proscenium arch and a reputation for harboring comedy. Casey agreed to produce the play and Sandy Duncan, Charles Kimbrough, Susan Sullivan and David Pittu signed on to perform. David Saint, the director of the three previous productions, agreed to take time off from his job as artistic director of the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J., to direct it once more. It opens on Wednesday.</p><p>Much as I may have changed ''The Fourth Wall,'' the world around it seems to have changed even more. Today, with sabers rattling in Washington, terrorists attacking at home and reassembling abroad, and our pride in our economic system seriously diminished by the misdeeds of several major captains of industry, I can't help but hope that audiences for this play will find its political indignation more important and germane than they did in its earlier versions.</p><p>Aristophanes' Old Comedies seem to have thrived in the heightened atmosphere of public anxiety and political urgency, when the Spartan jackboots could almost be heard marching outside the walls of Athens. All the more reason, he must have felt, to entertain, admonish and cajole his fellow citizens under the guise of laughter.</p><p>In my own case, I hope that this reincarnation of ''The Fourth Wall,'' for all its lightheartedness, contains an underlying sense of what is fashionably called gravitas, which may have been found lacking in some of my other endeavors.</p><p>Photo: Charles Kimbrough and Sandy Duncan in ''The Fourth Wall'' by A.
