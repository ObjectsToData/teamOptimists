    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" From Photo to Lecture      Thomas E. Franklin, a 1988 graduate of Purchase College, was a staff photographer at The Record in Bergen County when he crossed the Hudson on the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001, to photograph the collapsed World Trade Center. It was exactly 5:01 p.m. -- his digital camera recorded the time -- when he made the iconic photograph of three firefighters raising the flag at ground zero. ''So much of that day is a blur for me,'' he said, ''but as a passing thought I recognized that my picture had symbolism.''    The photograph ran the next day in The Record, bringing fame both to Mr. Franklin and the newspaper. He said the Record received 1,000 e-mail messages that day and 1,000 phone calls that week about the photo. Eight people were hired just to answer the phones. Mr. Franklin, 36, who still works at The Record, has appeared on the ''Today'' show and has met President Bush. The picture, which is owned by The Record, has raised millions of dollars for charity through the North Jersey Media Group Disaster Relief Fund. A special postal stamp has also been issued.   ">

The photograph ran the next day in The Record, bringing fame both to Mr. Franklin and the newspaper.

                    <p>Other speakers in the series include David Schwartz, chief curator of film at the American Museum of the Moving Image (Nov. 13); Johan Marfey, creative director for Revlon (Dec. 4) and Antonio Pagliarulo, author of ''Rocking the Goddess: Campus Wicca for the Student Practitioner'' (Dec. 11).

Kissinger. Mr. Jarecki, who co-produced and directed the film ''The Trials of Henry Kissinger,'' grew up in Rye with a father who left Germany in 1939, shortly after Mr. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize winner, did. ''I regarded him as an immigrant success story,'' Mr. Jarecki said. ''I knew little about the cruelties of U.S. policies in countries around the world.''</p><p>He said that his film, made with Alex Gibney, who co-produced and wrote it, was provoked by ''The Trial of Henry Kissinger,'' a book by Christopher Hitchens arguing that Mr. Kissinger should be put on trial for war crimes he is accused of committing in countries like Chile, Cambodia and Indonesia. The film, which Newsday said, ''informs, fascinates and leaves one with an ugly taste in the mouth,'' presents speakers both supportive and critical of Mr. Kissinger.</p><p>The film will be shown at the Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville on Nov. 19 at 7 p.m., when Mr. Jarecki will give the introduction and lead a discussion afterward ($12). It can also be seen from Nov. 15 through 21 at the center ($9). Information: (914) 747-5555.</p><p>Home Art Show</p><p>Once a year Elise Goldschlag, a fiber artist, hires movers to take the furniture from the first floor and finished basement of her Irvington house to her garage for the weekend. Then about 2,000 people show up at her house for an art fair presented by the Wild Angels, a group of 25 artists that Ms. Goldschlag helped found seven years ago.</p><p>This year the event, which features jewelers, ceramic artists, painters, woodworkers and others, will be held Nov. 23 and 24 from 10 to 6 p.m. Ms. Goldschlag said that there is parking on the streets and that thankfully ''everyone doesn't show up at once.''</p><p>The Wild Angels first formed to share expenses and connections, and to show and sell work with like-minded exhibitors. A jury determines who will participate in the fair, where items sell from $20 to $500. This year, for the first time, two high school students are included ''to give them a chance to get their feet wet in the business end of art and allow the community a peek at the next generation of artists,'' Ms. Goldschlag said. Admission is free. Information: (914) 591-8447.   ROBERTA HERSHENSON</p><p>Photos (John W. Wheeler)  </p>                </div>
