Sometimes it means ''late'' rather than ''after,'' as in postcapitalism, and sometimes, as in postmodernism, it means something like ''once more without feeling.''</p><p>As it happens, the same sort of process has been going on more quietly with ''pre-'' at the other end of the scale. Time was, ''pre-'' chiefly meant ''before,'' as in prewar or prepubescent. In recent years, though, the dominant use of the prefix seems to be shifting to ''in advance.''</p><p>The world offers us preowned cars, preassembled furniture, precooked meals, prewashed denim and preapproved loans. Hotels urge us to prebook our rooms (undoubtedly more productive than postbooking them). At the airport gate, they announce preboarding, and the V.I.P.'s and first-class passengers start getting on the plane. It's an ideal prefix for an age that's preoccupied with getting a leg up on things.</p><p>The importance of getting an early advantage was behind the shift in the meaning of ''preschool'' about 50 or 60 years ago. Before that, the word could refer only to children too young to attend school.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Then progressive educators drafted it into service as a new name for the nursery school, which brought to mind a place where toddlers frittered away their days in idle play. ''Preschool'' implied a more goal-directed curriculum -- a ''developmentally oriented readiness program,'' as the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan puts it.</p><p>That's unquestionably a worthy object -- it's implicit in the name Head Start, after all. But in the case of institutions like the 92nd Street Y, ''preschool'' is understood a bit more specifically than it normally is -- it's really a shorthand for ''pre-pre-Harvard-Yale-or-Princeton.'' So it isn't surprising that parents go to considerable lengths to secure a place for their children on the first rung of that ladder.</p><p>''There are no bounds for what you do for your children,'' the Citigroup analyst Jack B. Grubman said in the e-mail message that suggested he might have traded a bullish rating on AT&amp;T for help from his boss, Sanford I. Weill, in getting his 2-year-old twins into the Y program. If that's correct, then few parents have a better right to make that claim.</p><p>In the earlier age of unapologetic privilege, a man making $20 million a year wouldn't have had to bother with such things -- members of the having classes simply put their sons down at birth for Groton or Eton. Now, anxious parents with no strings to pull are obliged to enlist friends and family in a frenzy of dialing on the morning after Labor Day, as they desperately try to secure one of the limited places on the schools' applicant lists.</p><p>''It's the most democratic way,'' explained Alix Friedman, the Y's director of public relations.</p><p>Indeed, it seems to have become a tenet of modern egalitarianism that the fairest way to apportion scarce resources, whether nursery-school places or postseason tickets, is according to people's deftness in handling the speed-dial button. Life is getting to feel a lot like ''Jeopardy.''</p><p>So it's natural that people should get indignant when someone's caught cutting to the head of the line -- not that most of them wouldn't have done the same if a pair of World Series tickets were in the balance.</p><p>THAT'S what predestination comes down to in these postmeritocratic times; it's a matter of going through the motions of equal access at the same time you're frantically trying to game the system. Among all the denials and disclaimers that were making the rounds last week, in fact, the ''butter wouldn't melt'' award would have to go to Ms. Friedman's assertion that a million-dollar donation from Citigroup hadn't helped to grease the way for Mr. Grubman's twins.</p><p>''No child is guaranteed admission here,'' she said. ''Every child -- every child -- goes through the same rigorous admissions process.''</p><p>What the skeptics found hard to swallow about that wasn't just the implausibility of supposing that the Y accepted Citigroup's money and then said, ''We'll get back to you on the Grubman kids'' -- or, what seems like an even bigger stretch, that a shrewd postcapitalist like Mr. Weill would have handed the Y a million bucks purely on speculation. It's the claim that the Y evaluates its 2 1/2-year-old applicants according to a ''rigorous admissions process,'' as if all those little Warburgs, Schiffs, Allens and Stings had been chosen on merit alone.</p><p>It reminds you that ''precocious'' is just the Latin for ''precooked'' -- you wonder if there are objective tests that can preselect the toddlers who will rise like souffl&eacute;s under the preschool's warm attentions.</p><p>Wouldn't the parents of a 92nd Street Y rejectee be happier if the Y just came out and said that the fix was in? Otherwise, it's a bit like being told that the passengers who are preboarding in first class were selected because they looked as if they would make the best use of the Champagne, not because they paid more for their tickets.</p><p>IT may be, as Nicholas Lemann suggests in ''The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,'' that the meritocratic system began to unravel when it ceased to be aimed at picking the best people for public service and became largely a matter of deciding how to hand out the goodies. What is clear is that opportunity is increasingly a matter of getting an early jump on things -- of pretesting, preselection, preapproval, preadmission and, not to be coy about it, prepayment. Or, as a letter I received the other day informs me, ''You may already be a winner.''</p><p>Drawing (David Suter)</p>                </div>
