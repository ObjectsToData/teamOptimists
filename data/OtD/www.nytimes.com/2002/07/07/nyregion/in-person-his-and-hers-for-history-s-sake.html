                    <p>But Ms. Stewart, a forceful woman who sees herself as his first-line editor, gives a hearty laugh, and interjects her own version of what he could have said: ''I'm going to spend the rest of my life writing about you.''</p><p>And she would be exaggerating only slightly. Dr. Lewis spent 15 years of his life -- and hers -- writing a landmark biography about Mr. Du Bois, a charismatic intellectual but not necessarily a likable man who had numerous adulterous affairs and ended his days in self-imposed exile in Ghana, an advocate of communism.</p><p>Each of its massive volumes -- the first at 735 pages, the second at 715 -- won Dr. Lewis a Pulitzer Prize for biography, ''W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919'' in 1994 and ''W.E.B. Du Bois, 1919-1963'' in 2001, both published by Henry Holt and Company.</p><p>If the book is a labor of love, it has less to do with Du Bois and more to do with the loving but sometimes labored relationship between the husband as writer and the wife as reader-editor.</p><p>Dr. Lewis acknowledged as much by dedicating both volumes to Ms. Stewart for her ''take-charge resiliency and untold hours of critical reading,'' (Vol. 1) because ''her endless re-readings and suggestions improved the book and the biographer'' (Vol. 2) and for ''saving the quality of our lives.'' (Vol 2.)</p><p>''I intruded on her privacy and concentration and whatever it was she was wanting to do,'' he said. ''Not a week went by when I did not come out of my hole and say, 'Look here. Would you listen to this?' ''</p><p>''I understood,'' said Ms. Stewart, herself the author of a biography, ''Portia: The Life of Portia Washington Pittman: The Daughter of Booker T. Washington,'' (Doubleday 1977.) ''For David,'' she said, ''writing is such an unforgiving thing in that's it's being alone, it's concentrative, and David has an extraordinary ability to concentrate and just keep things at bay. I could go by his study and say the house is on fire and he would say, 'Yes dear,'' and keep on writing.''</p><p>For his efforts, Dr. Lewis has received many honors. Within recent months, he has been notified of his election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which was established in 1780 by John Adams, John Hancock and other founding fathers, and to the American Philosophical Society, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1743.</p><p>Mr. Lewis was born in Little Rock, Ark., into an intellectual atmosphere (his father was a Yale graduate, his mother a teacher) and grew up in Wilberforce and Atlanta, where he attended high school and graduated after only one year. He enrolled at Fisk University in Nashville, Mr. Du Bois' alma mater.</p><p>After graduation as a Phi Beta Kappa, he acceded to his parents' wishes and studied law at Michigan State. But he dropped out after a semester and hopped a bus for New York City where he sought out Jacques Barzun, the noted historian and dean of Columbia University.</p><p>''So,'' said Dr. Lewis, ''I walked into Jacques Barzun's office and said, 'I've just quit the University of Michigan Law School; it was a mistake, and I want to do history.' ''</p><p>It worked, he said.</p><p>He received his doctorate in French and European history from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and after a stint in the Army, took a job teaching at the University of Ghana for a year, not because Mr. Du Bois had ended his days there at age 95 in 1963, he says, but because he was interested in working in an African country that was emerging as a democracy.</p><p>He has also taught at Howard University, Notre Dame and the University of the District of Columbia. He was working at the University of California at San Diego, when Rutgers enticed him away in 1986 to become the Martin Luther King Jr. professor in its history department.</p><p>Ms. Stewart, the daughter of a Chicago postal supervisor and a mother who sold encyclopedias, has her own impressive list of accomplishments.</p><p>An expert on the role of the arts in economic and community development, she is research professor in cultural policy at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers where she is designing a curriculum in cultural policy.</p><p>''In the post-industrial world,'' she said, ''the arts are emerging as a way in which cities and towns can define themselves and attract new interest in themselves as a place to live, a place to work and a place to invest -- the perfect and closest example being the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.''</p>                </div>
