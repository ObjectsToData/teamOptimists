                    <p>IT wasn't until 20 pages from the end of Robert Twigger's deliriously clever chimera of a travel book about a chimerical but real deer that I put it into so many words: I am reading a book that keeps pretending it has not yet been written and may never, ever be written. If you think you catch that telltale, runny-Camembert reek of postmodernism, you're happily wrong. Twigger is an old-fashioned adventurer masquerading as a lazy, macho, na&iuml;ve neurotic with attention deficit disorder.</p><p>John Updike wrote of Bruce Chatwin -- before whose literary ghost Twigger fails to genuflect even once, surely a record among current British travel writers -- that his paragraphs are so short he seems to be constantly interrupting himself. Well, Twigger's paragraphs may behave themselves, but his 114 short chapters elbow one another out of the way. Try a typical sequence: ''Pseudonym,'' ''Hair,'' ''Freaks,'' ''Snail,'' ''Egypt III,'' ''Famous Photos,'' ''Breakthrough.'' This hodgepodge is not the hip-hop stratagem of a writer who can't lay out a chronological narrative; Twigger did that, and more, in his two previous books: ''Angry White Pyjamas,'' about a year with the Tokyo Riot Police on their brutal aikido course, won both the Somerset Maugham Award for literature and the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award; and ''Big Snake'' managed to tell of his failure to capture a 30-foot snake, which would be the world's longest to date, and win a $50,000 prize, as well as of the death of his tough-as-nails paternal grandfather and Twigger's marriage to his Egyptian love in a Bedouin tent on the Sinai peninsula. His apparent aimlessness is really a brilliant resort to corral subjects as disparate as a lost sweater and the Cairo used book trade into a spirited anti-Darwinian meditation on survival and the interconnectedness of all life -- themes that might easily degenerate into clich&eacute;s.</p><p>But to start at the beginning. The P&egrave;re David's deer is the rarest and oddest looking deer in the world except for, to my eye, the moose. The tines of its antlers point backward, its hooves are cowlike but click like a reindeer's, its neck seems to sag like a camel's, and its tail resembles a donkey's. It also has the longest gestation period of any deer; it has never been reported in the wild; and it would be extinct but for a Chinese emperor who, perhaps before 1000 B.C., enclosed a supply of these improbable but tasty beasts in a hunting park in Beijing. In 1865, Armand David, a robust French naturalist and missionary priest, who was also the first Westerner to describe the giant panda, risked his life to spirit away a specimen or two from the Nan Haizi reserve and send the remains by diplomatic bag to France. The find generated a certain notoriety. Various countries requested live deer about the same time they were seizing parts of what China considered its empire -- like Burma, Turkestan and Vietnam. In 1899 and 1900 the Boxer Rebellion, an antiforeign movement favored by the dowager empress, led to the siege of the European compound in Beijing. The siege was lifted by an international force, but the Celestial Empire was effectively extinguished, Beijing and the Forbidden City looted, and every single P&egrave;re David's deer on native ground slaughtered by starving peasants or hungry Russian soldiers.</p><p>The deer already safe in Europe had been sent to Woburn Abbey in England, where Herbrand Russell, the 11th duke of Bedford, an eccentric of the old school who fed his pet owl at the breakfast table, bred and protected them. As a fogey and reactionary, he further saw to it that the species survived the quota imposed on farm production of domesticated beasts during World War I. The herd, despite a low fertility rate and a susceptibility to disease deriving from having passed through a kind of genetic funnel, has thrived; animals have been deaccessioned to other private parks and zoos and to commercial hunting reserves in Texas, where they can be shot for $4,500 to $5,000 a trophy head (guide fees, lodging, and hostess's services extra); they even need to be culled at Woburn Abbey itself.</p><p>Enter then Twigger, through ''THE PHONE CALL that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE WITH MONEY.'' His agent Brigitte, over lunch with a descendant of the 11th duke, the current conservator of the deer, proposes that Twigger, one of whose own ancestors fought against the Boxers, write all this up in his inimitable manner for a large advance. Grabbed by the money, yet daunted by the restraint on creativity in the project, adrift in a maze of research, distracted by his newborn son, avoiding the travel the project calls for, bored as a guest at Woburn, snubbed as an error-prone fictionist by the world expert on the deer, but inspired by the spot-on feeling of truth he gets from observing wild animals and beginning to make all sorts of connections, he struggles to write this book. And -- ''intertesselation of the stars!'' as he exclaims about one coincidence in his tale -- he succeeds.</p><p>The book, of course, grows into something far from what agent, editor, and experts envisaged. It is part made-up stories involving, for example, an American hunter named John Major and a nameless British major who belongs to a club dedicated to exterminating endangered species; part research, which may or may not be reliable; part personal anecdote, again unverifiable; a bit of travel narrative; and a good deal of philosophical reflection that, in the manner of great poetry, pursues truth where linear prose could never follow it, dancing through a mercurial series of ideas and serendipities to a happy ending. Survival, not extinction, is what this many-knotted tale is all about.</p><p>Nostalgia for lost skills, a loathing not for progress but for ''the deep belief that . . . you couldn't have medicine and gadgets without every garden being turned into a 20-story building,'' an admiration for great libraries and grief for their decline, a preoccupation with physical toughness and survival, a longing for a lost Eden that metamorphoses into a search for a secondhand book market in a Cairo neighborhood appropriately called Ezbekiya Gardens, a respect for ''ordinary men who knew when to make an extraordinary effort,'' the pleasant pangs of fatherhood -- these are but a few of the humane sensibilities that drive this book.</p><p>''I saw my will to keep writing as a specialized minor form of the will to keep living,'' Twigger comes to understand late in the game. Long before that, readers have identified him as a rare beast of a writer. May he survive our rush to extinction and continue to be fruitful and multiply.</p>                </div>
