High school at Alfred G. Berner in Massapequa, associate's degree Nassau Community College, bachelor of science Stony Brook, and finally doctorate in dentistry from Howard University in 1983.</p><p>Well, not exactly. The fact is, I left Nassau in 1977 without my associate's degree. As I recalled in that moment of ethical consternation, I had refused the sweaty obligation of a single credit in physical education. I was going to be a graduate of SUNY-Stony Brook, I was going to be a doctor, so what could it matter? One less diploma on the wall of my office that no one would bother to read anyway. It didn't matter at all, at least not until that damnable letter came.</p><p>To my eye, not listing that Nassau degree stuck out like a pair of white shoes at a funeral. I rationalized it every which way (and quite capably, owing to the philosophy electives I took at Nassau) and then I fretted about it (owing to the ethics course I took at Howard). Then I reached a decision based upon the premise that has toppled great men and empires: who will know but me?</p>                </div>

                    <p>Well, after the 2001 and 2002 editions, I finally sought to remedy the situation by requesting clearance for graduation from Nassau Community College. In January I filled out my application, sent in my $25 fee and waited for my diploma. In March came a letter from the office of the dean that denied my request and informed me that I was in fact short a three-credit humanities requirement and that as soon as I completed that I should reapply for a diploma.</p><p>I was stunned. Not only was I in error all these years but now my crime had increased substantially in significance. I was faced with the possibility of having to re-matriculate at age 45. At the very least my daughter, who is about to graduate from high school, would be mortified at the thought of her graying old man tossed back into the heap of post-pimple hopefuls at the local community college.</p><p>In my restless and sometimes sleepless nights, I saw myself stripped of all my life's accomplishments: disbarred, defrocked and disenfranchised. What might become of me? And then I summoned all of the knowledge and wisdom of my years of living and education and arrived at a strategy: I would beg.</p><p>I called up the dean. I told him I had become a dentist, written five volumes of poetry, had a radio show, served on three boards of directors. I had been published 10 times in Nassau Community College's literary magazine. I had given lectures to its English classes. I had been in ''Who's Who'' three years running. Can all of that possibly add up to three credits of humanities? Can I please graduate?</p><p>He seemed to listen carefully and said he would see what could be done.</p><p>Some time later I got the letter I had been waiting for since John Travolta was being Tony Manero in ''Saturday Night Fever.'' And last Sunday I formally became a graduate of community college; B.S., Stony Brook 1979, D.D.S. Howard 1983, A.S. Nassau Community College 2002.</p><p>Though I have a real sense of accomplishment, I skipped the graduation ceremony. I did not attend the ones at Stony Brook and Howard and there was no point in changing strategies at this late juncture.</p><p>I am also pleased at all the mail I'm getting from universities that would like to see me continue my education at their esteemed institutions. I'm even more pleased to not have to submit myself to that whole thing again.</p><p>But my wife insisted on a party. A nice cold keg, some hamburgers and franks and a bunch of friends in shorts and loud shirts. I was also thinking about a cross-country trip to celebrate, but I don't want to steal any of my daughter's thunder and after all, I've got to go to work on Monday morning. There are people with bad teeth, and somebody's going to have to pay for all of this tuition, what with one going in and two more not far behind.</p>                </div>
