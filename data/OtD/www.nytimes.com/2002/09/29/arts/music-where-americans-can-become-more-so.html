    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="IN 1935, Hunter Johnson, a North Carolina-born composer staying at the American Academy in Rome, got swept up in intense work on a dark, brooding piano sonata. He had won a yearlong residency at the academy, then as now a leading center for independent study and research in the arts and humanities. There he was, in that ancient, cultured city, living and working in the academy's 11-acre complex of studios and villas atop the Janiculum, the highest hill within the walls of Rome, with its spectacular views. Yet all Johnson, 29 at the time, could think about was his native land.    Amid the ''rotting splendor of Rome,'' he wrote in a letter, he was ''teeming defiantly with America.'' The sonata was ''an intense expression of the South,'' with its ''frenzied gaiety, high rhetoric and brutal realism.''  ">

                    <p>IN 1935, Hunter Johnson, a North Carolina-born composer staying at the American Academy in Rome, got swept up in intense work on a dark, brooding piano sonata. He had won a yearlong residency at the academy, then as now a leading center for independent study and research in the arts and humanities. There he was, in that ancient, cultured city, living and working in the academy's 11-acre complex of studios and villas atop the Janiculum, the highest hill within the walls of Rome, with its spectacular views. Yet all Johnson, 29 at the time, could think about was his native land.</p><p>Amid the ''rotting splendor of Rome,'' he wrote in a letter, he was ''teeming defiantly with America.'' The sonata was ''an intense expression of the South,'' with its ''frenzied gaiety, high rhetoric and brutal realism.''</p><p>Johnson's reactions were not atypical. One tenet of the academy, which was established in 1894 by the noted architect Charles Follen McKim, was that if provided an ideal working environment in a splendid European city, American artists might grow individually, learn from one another and gain a clearer sense of their artistic and national identity.</p><p>That's what happened to the New York-based pianist Donald Berman, now 40, when he spent four months as a special guest of the academy in 1998. (Performers are infrequently invited.) He delighted in the company of the fellows and residents -- artists, architects, writers and scholars as well as composers -- and took full advantage of Rome. He also spent hours listening to recordings and studying scores by American composers that he found in the academy's extensive research library. Mr. Berman has championed American composers, with Ives as a special interest. (''The Unknown Ives,'' his invaluable 1999 CRI release, offered premiere recordings of unpublished works and important pieces in new critical editions.) And he has been extensively involved with music by composers of his acquaintance.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But he felt there was a gap in his knowledge of 20th-century American music. ''My research at the academy helped to fill in the blanks,'' Mr. Berman said recently. ''I wondered what had happened to all these people I had never heard of.'' People like Walter Helfer, who taught at Hunter College in New York for more than 20 years, and Alexander Lang Steinert, who became the music director of the Army Air Forces' motion picture unit during World War II.</p><p>Eager to share what he had discovered, Mr. Berman persuaded the academy to help him set up a series of concerts in New York presenting works written either at the academy or by composers who had been there. He formed a committee, raised funds and put out a call for additional scores from past fellows. Within four weeks the committee received more than 200 scores from 41 composers.</p><p>With Mr. Berman serving as artistic director, it selected four programs of solo piano works, songs and chamber pieces for the series, ''Americans in Rome: Music by Fellows of the American Academy in Rome,'' which begins on Wednesday at Merkin Concert Hall. (The other dates are Oct. 16 and Nov. 6 and 13.) There are works by giants like Roger Sessions and Elliott Carter; by excellent composers who were recent fellows, like Stephen Hartke and Scott Lindroth; and by neglected composers, including Johnson.</p><p>Besides presenting nearly 40 works they believe in, Mr. Berman and the committee, including the composers John Harbison, Robert Beaser, Kathryn Alexander and Paul Moravec, hope that the series will shed light on what it means to be an American composer.</p><p>If living abroad proves helpful to American composers, it's partly because America has long had trouble shaking off its cultural inferiority complex with regard to Europe. Too many American artists and institutions see themselves in a losing game of catch-up with Europe. The complex was at its height in the 1920's, when the American Academy added composers to its roster of fellows.</p><p>One supporter was Walter R. Spalding, a professor of music at Harvard, who became a trustee of the academy. Spalding asserted that the new program would offer urgently needed help to American music. Although American schools had long been producing first-rank performers, he wrote in a 1920 essay celebrating the academy's 25th anniversary, ''they never have and, in the nature of things, they cannot produce composers.''</p><p>Sadly, Spalding's attitude was part of the problem. But he was right that being in Rome, an artistic wellspring for two millennia, would help Americans develop. Being away from home yet together in a community helped even more.</p><p>One reason composers have been so productive at the academy is simply that the place, with its 18 buildings, is so wonderful. The restored 17th-century Villa Aurelia has lovely spaces for concerts and lectures. The 130-room McKim Building has studios, a library, galleries and residential units. Every year as many as 30 American artists and scholars, selected by a national jury, are awarded the academy's Rome Prize, a fellowship of from six months to two years. There are also residents: senior artists and researchers. The academy typically supports a community of about 75. Since its founding, some 1,500 fellows and 320 residents have lived there.</p>                </div>
