As a medicine man chanted and banged on a drum, other participants brought glowing-hot rocks into the tent, which was then sealed shut. Once the tent was pitch-dark, the medicine man, Charles Thom Sr., sprinkled herbs onto the rocks and poured water on them, filling the tent with a heat as intense as any sauna, but somehow redoubled by the aroma of the secret herbs.    For more than 20 minutes the men, dressed in shorts and bathing suits, and the women, in long skirts, sarongs and tank tops, chanted with Mr. Thom, a member of the Karuk tribe from Northern California. After a break when participants were allowed to step into the midday sunshine for refreshment and some cooler air, the process was repeated.  ">

                    <p>Until Aug. 11, 1978, when Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, ceremonies like the sweat lodge were illegal. Today, Mr. Thom and others are turning sweat lodge ceremonies into commercial enterprises, making their way into spas and 12-step groups and mounting carnival-like tours.</p><p>The sponsoring group for last weekend's sweat lodge in Baiting Hollow, north of Riverhead, was the Earth Circle Association, a Fort Jones, Calif.-based nonprofit that tours the country and is host to two sweat lodges on Long Island each year. The suggested donation is $50.</p><p>The commercialization of the ceremony has some Native Americans living on Long Island crying foul.</p><p>Several members of the Southampton-based Shinnecock tribe criticized the Earth Circle ceremony, saying it should not be shared with outsiders. Harry Wallace, chief of the Unkechaug, who own the Poospatuck Reservation in Mastic, was more blunt.</p><p>''They've taken our land, they've tried to take our children, now they are trying to take our religion and spiritual practices,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''Sweat lodge is not just a religious practice, it's a way of life. It's not something you only do on the weekend.''</p><p>Participants in such ceremonies have decidedly different opinions.</p><p>''For some people, it is a way of life,'' said Steven Hochman, 55, a limousine driver from Deer Park who participated in last weekend's sweat lodge. ''Others come here and there. I've been doing it for 15 years and it's very centering and dear to my heart. It feels good. It feels right. For myself it's a way of getting in touch with spirit.''</p><p>Christopher Vecsey, a humanities professor at Colgate University who said he had participated in many sweat lodges, said they had been around in one form or another for thousands of years and no organization owns them. ''The sweat lodge is a circumpolar phenomenon,'' Dr. Vecsey said. ''It exists all across the Northern Hemisphere -- Siberia, Northern Scandinavia and as far south as Central America. You might find among hundreds of different groups, a hundred different creation stories, but it is truly an ethnically ecumenical event.''</p><p>Ed McGaa, the author of ''Native American Paths to Healing Ourselves and Our World,'' is an Oglala Sioux also known as Eagle Man. Mr. McGaa said his Plains Indian tribe and many others he has worked with see the sweat lodge as a way to share their culture and help Americans find a more spiritual path.</p><p>''There are whites now that are waking up and seeing the real truth and depth of what the native man has preserved,'' he said. ''All of the great Indian prophets believe that certain ceremonies should be shared. Sweat lodge is un-owned and universal.''</p><p>He did warn against sweat lodge organizers who don't have experience or knowledge of the ceremony. Not least are the safety issues. A sweat lodge can be dangerous for anyone with a heart or respiratory illness. In June, two people died at a sweat lodge sponsored by a vision quest group in Northern California.</p><p>Participants at last weekend's sweat lodge were aware of the danger, but most said they were comfortable with Mr. Thom and his skill. Kathy Donnelly of Stony Brook said it was sometimes unbearable hot in the lodge, but she felt it brought her closer to nature and reminded her of what it means to be an American.</p><p>''It's really a means of worshiping,'' said Ms. Donnelly, a registered nurse.</p><p>Another participant, Matthew Wichrowski of Brentwood, said he didn't understand why the Long Island Indians would want to exclude anyone from the sweat lodge.</p><p>''Inside the lodge we're all the same,'' Mr. Wichrowski said. ''We just have a voice and prayers, and that's all that matters.''</p><p>Photo: Matthew Wichrowski shoveling coals for the sweat lodge's stove. The lodge gets as hot as the hottest sauna.
