    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Subject tests are only occasionally required but are often recommended to provide an edge in graduate school admission. Among the eight subject tests that are part of the Graduate Record Examinations, English literature is the only one in the humanities -- the sole subject with an undergraduate curriculum that was consistent enough for a national test. Here is a sampling of G.R.E. subject-test questions reflecting what undergraduates are being taught in literature.         1. She is the plaything of a cruel destiny and is eventually maddened by the many wrongs she endures. After her trial for the murder of her seducer, she is hanged at Winchester.     The heroine is:    a. Thackeray's Becky     Sharp    b. Hemingway's Brett     Ashley    c. James's Daisy Miller    d. Dickens's Little Nell    e. Hardy's Tess       2. Identify the author:    The One remains, the many change and pass;/ Heaven's light forever shines, earth's shadows fly;/ Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass/ Stains the white radiance of eternity,/ Until Death tramples it to fragments.    a. Dickinson    b. Pound    c. Dryden    d. Shelley    e. Byron        3. In the late 19th century, the locomotive occasionally held the role of the time-hallowed deus ex machina; in the 20th, the automobile accident has replaced it.    The point argued is best illustrated by:    a. ''Madame Bovary'' and     ''A Farewell to Arms''    b. ''Jane Eyre'' and ''To     the Lighthouse''    c. ''Anna Karenina'' and     ''The Great Gatsby''    d. ''Crime and     Punishment'' and     ''Ulysses''    e. ''What Maisie Knew''    and ''The Stranger''        4. His stage sets strongly reinforce his themes. The set progression in ----------, for example, as we descend from an upper-class drawing room through a Salvation Army relief center to a housing project for a munitions factory, reinforces his argument about the underpinnings of industrial society.     Which of the following correctly fills in the blank?    a. ''Who's Afraid of     Virginia Woolf?''    b. ''Long Day's Journey     Into Night''    c. ''Our Town''    d. ''Major Barbara''    e. ''Six Characters in     Search of an Author''        5. O, O, all brought to pass, all true!/ O light, may I behold thee nevermore!/ I stand a wretch, in birth, in wedlock cursed,/ A parricide, incestuous, triply cursed.    The ''I'' of the lines is:    a. Malvolio    b. Falstaff    c. Achilles    d. Oedipus    e. Ulysses        6. She loved me for the danger I had passed,/ And I loved her that she did pity them.    The speaker of these lines is:    a. Macbeth    b. Romeo    c. Antony    d. Malvolio    e. Othello        7. And they have lain with beauty/ all their lives./ And they have fed on honeydew/ and drunk the wines of Paradise/ so that they know exactly how/ a thing of beauty is a joy/ forever and forever.    The excerpt from ''A Coney Island of the Mind,'' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, alludes to poems by:    a. Wordsworth and     Shelley    b. Coleridge and Keats    c. Pope and Dryden    d. Milton and Spenser    e. Tennyson and Swift       8. Identify the author:    Our age is retrospective. ... It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face, we through their eyes. ... Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?    e. Twain    a. Emerson    b. Hawthorne    c. Irving    d. Melville       9. Although 400 years separate them, both are fundamentally didactic plays designed to teach by explication, by the dramatization of the ideas that dictate their dramatic structure.    Which of the following are     described in the passage above?    a. ''Cojmus'' and ''A     Streetcar Named Desire''    b. ''Richard II'' and ''The     House of Bernarda Alba''    c. ''The Rivals'' and ''Titus    Andronicus''    d. ''Andromache'' and     ''Miss Julie''    e. ''Everyman'' and     ''Mother Courage''        10. What is ----------------?/ A dwarfish whole,/ Its body    brevity, and wit its soul.    Which fills in the blank?    a. an ode    b. an elegy    c. an epigram    d. an epilogue    e. a pastoral        11. Like Sherlock Holmes, -------------------- appears as the recurrent principal of a series of stories; he also was presented through the eyes of an admiring friend; his tastes were recondite; his methods were those of stringent scientific rationalism.    Which fills in the blank?    a. Dostoyevsky's    Raskolnikov    b. Balzac's Père Goriot    c. Dickens's Sam Weller    d. Poe's Dupin    e. Gide's Lafcadio        Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye./ Upon an amblere esily she sat,/ Ywympled wel, and on hir heed an hat/ As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;/ A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large;/ And on hir feet a pair of spores sharpe./ In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe./ Of remedies of love she knew per chaunce,/ For she koude of that art the old daunce. -- Chaucer        1. The closest paraphrase of ''soothly for to seye'' is:    a. to say smoothly    b. surely to see    c. to tell the truth    d. to soothsay    e. to see truly        2. An amblere is a:     a. provincial coach    b. horse with an easy gait    c. rocking chair    d. church pew    e. steed        3. Choose the best translation of ''in felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe.''    a. in company she could     laugh and chat well    b. she always mocked     and complained about     others    c. in fellowship she     carped and chatted    d. she laughed and sang     with the fellows    e. she laughed and     avoided fellowship        4. The passage describes:    a. Pertelote    b. Griselda    c. prioress    d. wife of Bath    e. Emily        5. The passage was written     between:    a. 900 and 1000    b. 1120 and 1175    c. 1375 and 1425    d. 1500 and 1550    e. 1600 and 1650        How this tart fable instructs/ And mocks! Here's the parody of that moral mousetrap/ Set in the proverbs stitched on samplers/ Approving chased girls who get them to a tree/ And put on bark's nun-black/ Habit which deflects/ All     amorous arrows. -- SYLVIA PLATH        1. The tart fable is the story of:    a. Leda    b. Pandora    c. Medusa    d. Europa    e. Daphne        2. The moral mousetrap is:    a. glorification of     virginity    b. insistence on financial    probity    c. responsibilities     of those who care    for aged parents    d. demands of religious     devotions    e. desire for worldly     experience        3.

	data-description="Subject tests are only occasionally required but are often recommended to provide an edge in graduate school admission. Among the eight subject tests that are part of the Graduate Record Examinations, English literature is the only one in the humanities -- the sole subject with an undergraduate curriculum that was consistent enough for a national test. Here is a sampling of G.R.E. subject-test questions reflecting what undergraduates are being taught in literature.         1. She is the plaything of a cruel destiny and is eventually maddened by the many wrongs she endures. After her trial for the murder of her seducer, she is hanged at Winchester.     The heroine is:    a. Thackeray's Becky     Sharp    b. Hemingway's Brett     Ashley    c. James's Daisy Miller    d. Dickens's Little Nell    e. Hardy's Tess       2. Identify the author:    The One remains, the many change and pass;/ Heaven's light forever shines, earth's shadows fly;/ Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass/ Stains the white radiance of eternity,/ Until Death tramples it to fragments.    a. Dickinson    b. Pound    c. Dryden    d. Shelley    e. Byron        3. In the late 19th century, the locomotive occasionally held the role of the time-hallowed deus ex machina; in the 20th, the automobile accident has replaced it.    The point argued is best illustrated by:    a. ''Madame Bovary'' and     ''A Farewell to Arms''    b. ''Jane Eyre'' and ''To     the Lighthouse''    c. ''Anna Karenina'' and     ''The Great Gatsby''    d. ''Crime and     Punishment'' and     ''Ulysses''    e. ''What Maisie Knew''    and ''The Stranger''        4. His stage sets strongly reinforce his themes. The set progression in ----------, for example, as we descend from an upper-class drawing room through a Salvation Army relief center to a housing project for a munitions factory, reinforces his argument about the underpinnings of industrial society.     Which of the following correctly fills in the blank?    a. ''Who's Afraid of     Virginia Woolf?''    b. ''Long Day's Journey     Into Night''    c. ''Our Town''    d. ''Major Barbara''    e. ''Six Characters in     Search of an Author''        5. O, O, all brought to pass, all true!/ O light, may I behold thee nevermore!/ I stand a wretch, in birth, in wedlock cursed,/ A parricide, incestuous, triply cursed.    The ''I'' of the lines is:    a. Malvolio    b. Falstaff    c. Achilles    d. Oedipus    e. Ulysses        6. She loved me for the danger I had passed,/ And I loved her that she did pity them.    The speaker of these lines is:    a. Macbeth    b. Romeo    c. Antony    d. Malvolio    e. Othello        7. And they have lain with beauty/ all their lives./ And they have fed on honeydew/ and drunk the wines of Paradise/ so that they know exactly how/ a thing of beauty is a joy/ forever and forever.    The excerpt from ''A Coney Island of the Mind,'' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, alludes to poems by:    a. Wordsworth and     Shelley    b. Coleridge and Keats    c. Pope and Dryden    d. Milton and Spenser    e. Tennyson and Swift       8. Identify the author:    Our age is retrospective. ... It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face, we through their eyes. ... Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?    e. Twain    a. Emerson    b. Hawthorne    c. Irving    d. Melville       9. Although 400 years separate them, both are fundamentally didactic plays designed to teach by explication, by the dramatization of the ideas that dictate their dramatic structure.    Which of the following are     described in the passage above?    a. ''Cojmus'' and ''A     Streetcar Named Desire''    b. ''Richard II'' and ''The     House of Bernarda Alba''    c. ''The Rivals'' and ''Titus    Andronicus''    d. ''Andromache'' and     ''Miss Julie''    e. ''Everyman'' and     ''Mother Courage''        10. What is ----------------?/ A dwarfish whole,/ Its body    brevity, and wit its soul.    Which fills in the blank?    a. an ode    b. an elegy    c. an epigram    d. an epilogue    e. a pastoral        11. Like Sherlock Holmes, -------------------- appears as the recurrent principal of a series of stories; he also was presented through the eyes of an admiring friend; his tastes were recondite; his methods were those of stringent scientific rationalism.    Which fills in the blank?    a. Dostoyevsky's    Raskolnikov    b. Balzac's Père Goriot    c. Dickens's Sam Weller    d. Poe's Dupin    e. Gide's Lafcadio        Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye./ Upon an amblere esily she sat,/ Ywympled wel, and on hir heed an hat/ As brood as is a bokeler or a targe;/ A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large;/ And on hir feet a pair of spores sharpe./ In felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe./ Of remedies of love she knew per chaunce,/ For she koude of that art the old daunce. -- Chaucer        1. The closest paraphrase of ''soothly for to seye'' is:    a. to say smoothly    b. surely to see    c. to tell the truth    d. to soothsay    e. to see truly        2. An amblere is a:     a. provincial coach    b. horse with an easy gait    c. rocking chair    d. church pew    e. steed        3. Choose the best translation of ''in felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe.''    a. in company she could     laugh and chat well    b. she always mocked     and complained about     others    c. in fellowship she     carped and chatted    d. she laughed and sang     with the fellows    e. she laughed and     avoided fellowship        4. The passage describes:    a. Pertelote    b. Griselda    c. prioress    d. wife of Bath    e. Emily        5. The passage was written     between:    a. 900 and 1000    b. 1120 and 1175    c. 1375 and 1425    d. 1500 and 1550    e. 1600 and 1650        How this tart fable instructs/ And mocks! Here's the parody of that moral mousetrap/ Set in the proverbs stitched on samplers/ Approving chased girls who get them to a tree/ And put on bark's nun-black/ Habit which deflects/ All     amorous arrows. -- SYLVIA PLATH        1. The tart fable is the story of:    a. Leda    b. Pandora    c. Medusa    d. Europa    e. Daphne        2. The moral mousetrap is:    a. glorification of     virginity    b. insistence on financial    probity    c. responsibilities     of those who care    for aged parents    d. demands of religious     devotions    e. desire for worldly     experience        3. Which of the following calls up its homophone and becomes a pun when the lines are read aloud?    a. fable    b. mocks    c. stitched    d. chased    e. bark's    Quiz Answers    Questions are on Page 47.

                    <p>Subject tests are only occasionally required but are often recommended to provide an edge in graduate school admission. Among the eight subject tests that are part of the Graduate Record Examinations, English literature is the only one in the humanities -- the sole subject with an undergraduate curriculum that was consistent enough for a national test. Here is a sampling of G.R.E. subject-test questions reflecting what undergraduates are being taught in literature.</p><p>1.

Identify the author:</p><p>The One remains, the many change and pass;/ Heaven's light forever shines, earth's shadows fly;/ Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass/ Stains the white radiance of eternity,/ Until Death tramples it to fragments.</p><p>a. Dickinson</p><p>b. Pound</p><p>c. Dryden</p><p>d. Shelley</p><p>e. Byron</p><p>3. In the late 19th century, the locomotive occasionally held the role of the time-hallowed deus ex machina; in the 20th, the automobile accident has replaced it.</p><p>The point argued is best illustrated by:</p><p>a. ''Madame Bovary'' and</p><p>''A Farewell to Arms''</p><p>b. ''Jane Eyre'' and ''To</p><p>the Lighthouse''</p><p>c. ''Anna Karenina'' and</p><p>''The Great Gatsby''</p><p>d. ''Crime and</p><p>Punishment'' and</p><p>''Ulysses''</p><p>e. ''What Maisie Knew''</p><p>and ''The Stranger''</p><p>4. His stage sets strongly reinforce his themes. The set progression in ----------, for example, as we descend from an upper-class drawing room through a Salvation Army relief center to a housing project for a munitions factory, reinforces his argument about the underpinnings of industrial society.</p><p>Which of the following correctly fills in the blank?</p><p>a. ''Who's Afraid of</p><p>Virginia Woolf?''</p><p>b. ''Long Day's Journey</p><p>Into Night''</p><p>c. ''Our Town''</p><p>d. ''Major Barbara''</p><p>e. ''Six Characters in</p><p>Search of an Author''</p><p>5. O, O, all brought to pass, all true!/ O light, may I behold thee nevermore!/ I stand a wretch, in birth, in wedlock cursed,/ A parricide, incestuous, triply cursed.</p><p>The ''I'' of the lines is:</p><p>a. Malvolio</p><p>b. Falstaff</p><p>c. Achilles</p><p>d. Oedipus</p><p>e. Ulysses</p><p>6. She loved me for the danger I had passed,/ And I loved her that she did pity them.</p><p>The speaker of these lines is:</p><p>a. Macbeth</p><p>b. Romeo</p><p>c. Antony</p><p>d. Malvolio</p><p>e. Othello</p><p>7. And they have lain with beauty/ all their lives./ And they have fed on honeydew/ and drunk the wines of Paradise/ so that they know exactly how/ a thing of beauty is a joy/ forever and forever.</p><p>The excerpt from ''A Coney Island of the Mind,'' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, alludes to poems by:</p><p>a. Wordsworth and</p><p>Shelley</p><p>b. Coleridge and Keats</p><p>c. Pope and Dryden</p><p>d. Milton and Spenser</p><p>e. Tennyson and Swift</p><p>8. Identify the author:</p><p>Our age is retrospective. ... It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face, we through their eyes. ... Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?</p><p>e. Twain</p><p>a. Emerson</p><p>b. Hawthorne</p><p>c. Irving</p><p>d. Melville</p><p>9. Although 400 years separate them, both are fundamentally didactic plays designed to teach by explication, by the dramatization of the ideas that dictate their dramatic structure.</p><p>Which of the following are</p><p>described in the passage above?</p><p>a. ''Cojmus'' and ''A</p><p>Streetcar Named Desire''</p><p>b. ''Richard II'' and ''The</p><p>House of Bernarda Alba''</p><p>c. ''The Rivals'' and ''Titus</p><p>Andronicus''</p><p>d.

Like Sherlock Holmes, -------------------- appears as the recurrent principal of a series of stories; he also was presented through the eyes of an admiring friend; his tastes were recondite; his methods were those of stringent scientific rationalism.</p><p>Which fills in the blank?</p><p>a. Dostoyevsky's</p><p>Raskolnikov</p><p>b. Balzac's P&egrave;re Goriot</p><p>c. Dickens's Sam Weller</p><p>d. Poe's Dupin</p><p>e.

The closest paraphrase of ''soothly for to seye'' is:</p><p>a. to say smoothly</p><p>b. surely to see</p><p>c. to tell the truth</p><p>d. to soothsay</p><p>e. to see truly</p><p>2.
