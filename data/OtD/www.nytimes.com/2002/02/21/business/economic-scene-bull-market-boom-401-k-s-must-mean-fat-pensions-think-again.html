So how many households were able to build their nest eggs to a level of wealth they could once only dream about?    To listen to some advocates of ''defined contribution'' retirement plans, like 401(k)'s, just about anyone could have done it. These plans allowed workers to escape from stodgy old-fashioned fixed-benefit plans, save what they could and manage their own money by buying mutual funds or even individual stocks. Meanwhile, their employers typically matched or even exceeded their contributions. And Washington conferred the same tax deductions on these plans as on the old defined-benefit plans.  ">

                    <p>IT was the great bull market of the century. It began in 1982 and sent the Dow Jones industrial average up some tenfold. So how many households were able to build their nest eggs to a level of wealth they could once only dream about?</p><p>To listen to some advocates of ''defined contribution'' retirement plans, like 401(k)'s, just about anyone could have done it. These plans allowed workers to escape from stodgy old-fashioned fixed-benefit plans, save what they could and manage their own money by buying mutual funds or even individual stocks. Meanwhile, their employers typically matched or even exceeded their contributions. And Washington conferred the same tax deductions on these plans as on the old defined-benefit plans.</p><p>But here are the stunning facts. Two-thirds of American households have not increased their retirement wealth from pensions at all since 1983 (compared with households led by people of comparable ages in that year) or have experienced a drop in the value of their pensions. Prof. Edward N. Wolff, the New York University economist, calculated the value of both defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, based on data from the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>It turns out that in 1998, 65 percent of all American households headed by a person between 47 and 64 had either the same pension wealth, adjusted for inflation, than households headed by people in that age group did 15 years earlier, or even less. For the household right in the middle of the pack -- the median -- retirement wealth fell 13 percent from 1983 to 1998. The figures include neither the market boom of 1999 and 2000 nor the bust of 2001.</p>                </div>

                    <p>What disguised the facts before was that overall gains in these retirement accounts were large. The problem is that these gains went disproportionately to the wealthy. For example, according to Professor Wolff's calculations, the households that had more pension wealth than 80 percent of all others -- those in the 80th percentile -- increased their retirement wealth by 19 percent. That was a respectable amount, but hardly outstanding, given the booming stock market. The big gains went to the really rich. Those in the 95th percentile experienced a rise in pension wealth of 176 percent in 15 years -- a nearly threefold increase.</p><p>So what is going on here? Defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, are supposed to give employees of all incomes an opportunity to earn better returns. Meantime, as William Wolman and Anne Colamosca point out in their book ''The Great 401(k) Hoax,'' available this spring from Perseus Publishing, corporations no longer have those pesky long-term liabilities to employees to worry about. But the investment risk is all on the worker. Defined-contribution plans have replaced defined-benefit plans in company after company across the nation, Mr. Wolman and Ms. Colamosca note. Professor Wolff's figures reinforce the point.</p><p>The great promise does not seem to have worked. Even when adding up the current value of Social Security benefits, pension wealth and a household's net worth -- the value of a house and other major assets, minus all debt -- Professor Wolff finds that wealth at retirement is down a remarkable 17 percent for the typical household headed by someone 47 to 64. The figures for those over 65 are more positive, but not by much.</p><p>Why haven't defined-contribution plans provided more retirement security in this era of soaring stock prices? One problem is that people often manage their investments poorly. Enron employees were urged to place most of their eggs in one basket: Enron stock. But when Enron collapsed late last year, the retirement savings of many were wiped out.</p><p>Some workers also take too little risk. This experience should serve as a warning to those who advocate the privatization of Social Security, a move that would let individuals manage a portion of the program for themselves.</p><p>But there are more important factors. The first is that wages grew slowly or fell for many people over these years, and pension programs are usually based on wages. Even the value of Social Security fell in these years as a result of poor earnings growth for so many workers. Also, some companies abandoned pensions altogether, and many workers lost pension assets when they lost their jobs.</p><p>A second factor is that some defined-contribution plans are more generous for those nearer the top of the income spectrum. For example, employers may contribute a greater proportion of a high-level worker's income to the pension plan.</p><p>A third factor may be obvious, but it is not widely understood. Because these contributions are usually based on a percentage of income, they are regressive by design. The more you make, the bigger the company contribution, even when the proportion matched is the same. The large early investments can compound rapidly over time.</p><p>Finally, defined-contribution plans require more voluntary savings on the part of workers. The point is to induce workers to save more. But the philosophy founders on the simple facts. It is far easier to save when you are making a lot of money than when you are making a little. The great advantage of Social Security as a retirement system is that its benefits tend to equalize retirement incomes. But the defined-contribution plans are adding to inequalities.</p><p>The upshot is that many Americans will have less income as a proportion of their current earnings when they retire. In an expansion of his research, published by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, Professor Wolff calculates that only 57 percent of households will be able to replace half or more of their current earnings level during retirement. In 1989, the percentage was 70 percent. Only one in four households will be able to produce $1,000 in retirement income each month, even when including Social Security benefits.</p><p>When average wages failed to grow in the 1980's and the first half of the 1990's, one response was always that workers were compensating for the poor performance because they now owned a piece of a rising stock market being propelled by higher corporate profits. It is still widely claimed that the movement toward defined-contribution plans helps that happen for typical workers. But the benefits of these plans are related to earnings, and now the hard empirical facts support early fears.</p><p>Washington gives corporations big tax breaks for defined-contribution plans. But despite a soaring stock market, which will almost surely not be repeated any time soon, not even those in the 80th percentile increased their retirement wealth substantially, and most American households fell behind. The Americans who have benefited most are the rich.</p><p>Chart: ''Richer Nest Eggs''  The change in pension wealth, 1983 to 1998, for middle-age Americans at different income levels.
