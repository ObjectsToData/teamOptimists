                    <p>DR. LLOYD I. SEDERER, 57, discovered Sigmund Freud in medical school and, as much as he loved chemistry and anatomy, he was hooked. The old texts helped him as he was ''searching to understand my own confusion,'' and he began a career studying the vagaries and twists of the human mind.</p><p>He went on to become a psychiatrist, eventually running one of the nation's premier psychiatric hospitals, McLean Hospital in Belmont, outside Boston.</p><p>''Human behavior is endlessly fascinating,'' he said. ''Everyone puzzles and marvels at it. You can learn from science, biology, human psychology and the great writers. It is a remarkable combination of science and humanities.''</p><p>This July, 36 years after he graduated from City College and left the Bronx where he grew up, he returned to New York. His new title is a mouthful: executive deputy commissioner for mental hygiene for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. But think of him as the city's psychiatrist. He will oversee the effort to deal with mental health problems, including how to treat the roughly one-third of the city's schoolchildren who show some effects from the attacks last September, according to surveys.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dr. Sederer worked for the American Psychiatric Association in Washington as the director of the division of clinical services, a job that involved developing treatment guidelines for psychiatric disorders, before going to New York.</p><p>''We have to learn how this event impacts individuals, families and communities over time,'' he said, seated in his office on Worth Street in a crisp white shirt with starched cuffs. ''And learning will mean generating data where there is too little now.''</p><p>''We ought to know the disorders that New Yorkers suffer from,'' he said. ''We need to be sure that people receive effective treatment. What has emerged is that kids exposed more closely to the event, geographically or personally, are more at risk to experience distress and potentially develop disorders. But kids still harboring some of the distress, fear or worry, given the opportunity and support, can put this behind them.''</p><p>He is preparing for the effects of future trauma. He said the studies after the Oklahoma City bombing had been helpful in understanding how ''different problems emerge at different times.''</p><p>He moved from Washington into a condo in TriBeCa on July 2, a day after he began his job. He has a son who works in Boston.</p><p>Dr. Sederer's father ran an office supply business where his mother also worked. ''I started working there when I was 8 years old,'' he said.</p><p>Dr. Sederer played league basketball into his 30's and tennis ''more than a normal human being should play tennis,'' but work now dominates his life, even his leisure time. He likes to read books or see films that deal with mental disorders and psychological struggles.</p><p>''You can't say about me something like 'he escapes to go deep sea diving,' '' he said, with a chuckle.</p><p>He has read nearly all of the numerous works about McLean Hospital, where he spent almost 11 years. Wealthy Bostonians, and writers and intellectuals like Sylvia Plath and John Nash, have received treatment there.</p><p>''My job was to open the hospital to all sectors,'' he said. ''We changed the patient population tremendously so more poor people and patients on entitlement programs received care.''</p><p>The most important book to come out of McLean, he said, was ''Girl, Interrupted,'' by Susanna Kaysen. It helped him understand the patient's perspective ''where others control your life.''</p><p>''It is extraordinarily telling and important to read for professionals,'' he said.</p><p>But Dr. Sederer was troubled by the film ''A Beautiful Mind.''</p><p>''It overstated the power of will and a relationship to help a person recover from a severe mental illness,'' he said. ''You are really blessed if you have a will and a mind like he did, and support from family like that.</p><p>''But it would be a mistake to conclude that that is an adequate treatment plan for severe and persistent mental illness. This was a disservice to people who wonder why they should take medication or go to training to get back into everyday life.''</p><p>But he praised the film for ''doing a startlingly good job of demonstrating how when you are ill with schizophrenia you cannot tell fact from fiction, reality from delusion.''</p><p>HE admires the novelist Philip Roth, especially his book ''The Human Stain.'' He said Mr. Roth had ''a powerful understanding of human psychology and what motivates human beings.''</p><p>He keeps a copy of the book ''The Ultimate Terrorists'' by Jessica Stern in his office because ''I think people should see it.''</p><p>''The book explains how a culture turns people into terrorists and martyrs and the threats before us,'' he said. ''It shows how deep this problem goes and how protracted the conflict and solutions will be.''</p><p>He wants to help New York, aided by a $112 million federal grant, ''continue to grow stronger.'' But he says it will be tough.</p><p>''Part of the recovery from any disaster is knowing it is over,'' he said. ''We are still at war. We are apt to go to war further. We live in a state of uncertainty as to whether another terrorist attack will occur. The inability to say it is over complicates the recovery process.''</p><p>Photo: DR. LLOYD I. SEDERER (Fred R.
