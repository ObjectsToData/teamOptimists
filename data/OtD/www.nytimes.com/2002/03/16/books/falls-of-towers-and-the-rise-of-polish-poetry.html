                    <p>Who could have foreseen the poetic ripples of Sept. 11? A week after the attack, Adam Zagajewski's poem ''Try to Praise the Mutilated World,'' written long before that day, ran on The New Yorker's back page. Czeslaw Milosz's poem ''The Multi-Storied Man'' seemed uncomfortably relevant. And Wislawa Szymborska's poem ''The Terrorist, He's Watching,'' composed a quarter of a century ago, came to look like a premonition. Innocent America became a land of experience. Postwar Polish poetry became eerily pertinent.</p><p>It is not as if the poets Czeslaw Milosz (pronounced CHESS-wass ME-wash), a Nobel laureate; Wislawa Szymborska (vee-SWAHV-ahh shimm-BOR-skah), also a Nobel laureate; Zbigniew Herbert and Mr. Zagajewski (zagg-ahh-YEV-ski) were unknowns before last year. But suddenly their poems hit a new American nerve.</p><p>On Wednesday ''Try to Praise the Mutilated World: An Evening in Celebration of Contemporary Polish Poetry'' filled the Great Hall of Cooper Union. The event, composed of readings in honor of Mr. Herbert, Mr. Milosz, Ms. Szymborska and Mr. Zagajewski, was organized by Alice Quinn,  executive director of the Poetry Society of America, in cooperation with the New York Institute of the Humanities and the Polish Cultural Institute.</p><p>The old masters could not make the event. Ms. Szymborska is nearing 80. Mr. Milosz is in his 90's. (Mr. Herbert died in 1998.) But Mr. Zagajewski, who is in his late 50's, was there, and he was joined as a reader by the poets' students, friends, translators and admirers, who went up onstage in alphabetical order: Clare Cavanagh, Elzbieta Czyzewska, Renata Gorczynski, Edward Hirsch, Mary Karr, Wendy Lesser, W. S. Merwin, Robert Pinsky, Omar Sangare, Susan Sontag, Rosanna Warren, Lawrence Weschler, and C. K. Williams. Four poster-size portraits of the poets looked out from the stage. The audience sat rapt for two hours.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The night began with a shock: Ms. Cavanagh read her translation of ''September 11,'' Ms. Szymborska's poem about a photograph of the people who ''jumped from the burning floors'' of the World Trade Center hand in hand.</p><p>The photograph halted them in life,</p><p>and now keeps them</p><p>above the earth toward the earth.</p><p>In that photograph, the poem continues:</p><p>There's enough time</p><p>for hair to come loose,</p><p>for keys and coins</p><p>to fall from pockets.</p><p>The room was stunned for a moment.</p><p>The silence was broken by the lustily sarcastic voice of Ms. Czyzewska, an actress. She read Ms. Szymbor ska's ''An Opinion on the Question of Pornography,'' about the smuttiness of all thinking, and ''In Praise of My Sister,'' an ode to everyone who doesn't write poetry. The thrill of the night was Ms. Szymborska's poem ''Birthday,'' which Ms. Czyzewska recited in Polish with great trilling rrr's. It's safe to say that more than half the room had no idea what she was saying, but they were won over by the sloshing, comical meter, which sounded something like a loud washing machine speaking in Dr. Seuss's relentless rhythms.</p><p>In translation, ''Birthday'' turned out to be a poem about the bewilderments of the world:</p><p>So much world all at once -- how it rustles and bustles!</p><p>Moraines and morays and morasses and mussels,</p><p>the flame, the flamingo, the flounder, the feather --</p><p>how to line them all up, how to put them together?</p><p>Polish poets, if they have their druthers, like to think about truth and philosophy, Mr. Hirsch declared, but they have been pulled time and again into being witnesses to history. He spoke of the ''survivor's guilt and survivor's amazement,'' evident in  Mr. Milosz's ''Caff&eacute; Greco.'' Ms. Karr, the novelist and poet from Texas, put it more bluntly: Poland, she said, has taken in its history a tremendous whipping.</p><p>What does that do to a nation's poems? Does it make them tender and tough, attentive to the little things in life and rambunctious with words? Ms. Karr read Mr. Herbert's ''Mr. Cogito Looks at a Deceased Friend,'' in which survivor guilt is made palpable:</p><p>Mr. Cogito walked into the corridor</p><p>to smoke a cigarette.</p><p>But when Mr. Cogito returned:</p><p>his friend was no longer there</p><p>something else lay</p><p>in his place</p><p>with a twisted head and goggled eyes.</p><p>How do the Polish poets deal with survivor guilt and astonishment?</p><p>Ms. Lesser, founder of ''Threepenny Review,'' said they ''get to philosophy through tangible objects.''</p><p>Mr. Pinsky suggested that they deal with guilt through irony, but not  the English kind. While English irony  is savage, the irony of Jonathan Swift, he noted, Polish irony is a ''melancholy, brooding sweetness'' with a bite. And then he read Mr. Herbert's ''Seventh Angel,'' about a ''black and nervous'' angel named Shemkel, who gets to stay on ''the squad'' only because of the angels' consideration for the number 7.</p><p>Then he recited Ms. Szymborska's ''Joy of Writing,'' in which the poet chastises letters ''up to no good'' and ''clauses so subordinate they'll never let her get away.'' Her mortal revenge on those immortal letters is that they are under her complete control: ''Not a thing will ever happen unless I say so.''</p><p>Maybe that is what motivates Polish poetry, the idea that words are the only good refuge from a world spun out of control. You can push words around. You can play with them. Mr. Sangare, a Polish actor, took his revenge on Ms. Szymbor ska's poem ''Nothing Twice'' by reading it dramatically, twice. Ms. Sontag read ''Franz Schubert: A Press Conference,'' by Mr. Zagajewski in which the composer in death answers questions about his life: ''Yes, my life was short. . . . Yes, I had little time. . . . No, I am not familiar with Wagner's music.''</p><p>Polish poetry, said Rosanna Warren, a poet, is ''a great antidote'' to both symbolism and solipsism. But when Mr. Weschler got up to read the poem ''Could Have,'' it was hard not to think, solipsistically, that Ms. Szymborska could have written it for those who did not die on Sept. 11:</p><p>You were saved because you were the first.</p><p>You were saved because you were the last.</p><p>Alone. With others.</p><p>On the right. The left.</p><p>Because it was raining.</p><p>Because of the shade.</p><p>Because the day was sunny.</p><p>The difference between life and death on any given day is just a matter of chance. And maybe that is also the difference in a nation's fate.</p><p>The evening ended with Mr. Zagajewski reading ''Try to Praise the Mutilated World.'' But before that, he recited ''To Go to Lvov,'' about his hometown, Lvov, once part of Poland, then part of the Soviet Union, now part of Ukraine. It concerned the strangeness of being from a place that no longer is what it was.</p><p>there was too much of Lvov, and now</p><p>there isn't any, it grew relentlessly</p><p>and the scissors cut it</p><p>Those not present were the stars. Mr. Zagajewski praised his masters, Ms. Szymborska, Mr. Milosz and Mr. Herbert, who ''had the elegance of not being here.'' But he added, speaking for the young and the living: ''What can I do? Here I am.''</p><p>Photos: Renata Gorczynski, an essayist preparing before the poetry reading on Wednesday night at Cooper Union. (Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times)(pg.
