    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THE war against terrorism promises to be a long one, and the horror of Sept. 11 may suggest that pulling out all the stops is justified. But any government policy, including war, has costs and benefits. Can traditional economic analysis provide useful insights into how to fight this war? Relevant analysis has been undertaken at least since the late 1970's, with a number of economists now specializing in this. Their findings are sometimes frustrating, but, by no means conclusive, can be surprisingly useful.    A first step is to determine all the costs of a terrorist attack. Sept. 11 clearly went beyond the loss of life, however tragic. The attack had serious economic consequences for consumer spending and airline travel. It had long-term consequences for the costs of insurance, new construction safeguards and airline security, to name but a few. It also took an emotional and psychological toll on the nation. In nations where terrorism is more common, experience shows that it deters foreign investment, and probably domestic investment as well. Tourism can be permanently reduced. Thus, however gruesome the calculus is, preventing terrorism has wide benefits.  ">

But any government policy, including war, has costs and benefits. Can traditional economic analysis provide useful insights into how to fight this war? Relevant analysis has been undertaken at least since the late 1970's, with a number of economists now specializing in this. Their findings are sometimes frustrating, but, by no means conclusive, can be surprisingly useful.</p><p>A first step is to determine all the costs of a terrorist attack. Sept. 11 clearly went beyond the loss of life, however tragic. The attack had serious economic consequences for consumer spending and airline travel. It had long-term consequences for the costs of insurance, new construction safeguards and airline security, to name but a few. It also took an emotional and psychological toll on the nation. In nations where terrorism is more common, experience shows that it deters foreign investment, and probably domestic investment as well. Tourism can be permanently reduced. Thus, however gruesome the calculus is, preventing terrorism has wide benefits.</p><p>But the more sophisticated economic analysis has to do with how best to fight such a war. One way of looking at terrorists is to understand that, as with consumers, they are constrained by financial resources -- and by the number and skills of their personnel. Also, a terrorist act, like a consumer purchase, has a certain benefit, or utility. For terrorists, the benefit is usually creating political instability.</p><p>For consumers, if a product becomes more expensive, we may buy less of it. For terrorists, if an act is made more difficult, or more dangerous, they will perceive that the cost is raised and may be deterred. They cannot afford many failures or the loss of personnel.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The first study to analyze terrorism this way was by William Landes in 1978. He found, for example, that when metal detectors were installed at American airports in 1973, there were far fewer hijackings the next three years.</p><p>The success of metal detectors was widely accepted then. But like consumers, terrorists may not merely stop buying a product, they may buy a cheaper substitute. Todd Sandler of the University of Southern California, a pioneer in the field, found that terrorists did just that. In a complex statistical analysis that would not have been clear in a mere eyeballing of the data, he and a co-author, Walter Enders of the University of Alabama, showed that terrorists usually sought ways to circumvent metal detectors. Among the most effective was to make bombs out of liquids. What is most compelling about the findings of Mr. Sandler and Mr. Enders is that the number of terrorist incidents remained about the same, but the techniques were changed to avoid detection.</p><p>Similarly, when American embassies were bombed in the 1980's, the government fortified the compounds. But the consequence, Mr. Sandler and Mr. Enders write, was a ''disturbing increase in assassinations of officials and military personnel outside of protected compounds.'' Now military and business personnel are usually protected, but tourists and civilians remain at risk.</p><p>Their analyses also suggest that terrorist activities ebb and flow in cycles. They find that incidents declined sharply in the 1990's, though casualties were higher. The danger is that when attacks decline, a nation becomes lax. In fact, they warned back in 2000 that cyclical patterns suggested that major terrorist activity was due again.</p><p>The policy implications are clearly frustrating. Preventive activity, like more elaborate security checks at airports, should be intensified. But Mr. Sandler and Mr. Enders say it is almost inevitable that terrorists will seek new ways to accomplish the same thing. ''It's unlikely a terrorist will try to use a shoe again,'' Mr. Sandler says. Thus, the ideal strategy is something like a full-court press. Adopt measures that address existing terrorist methods, but also try to anticipate new methods and technologies.</p><p>The evidence compiled by a range of researchers using these techniques also suggests that immediate military retaliation does not reduce terrorism over time. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, retaliation generally seems to encourage further terrorist response. In another example, the United States raided Libya in April 1986 for its suspected engineering of a discoth&egrave;que bombing in Berlin. But Mr. Sandler and Mr. Enders noted an immediate rise in terrorism aimed at American and British facilities and personnel around the world.</p><p>In the Afghan war, some economists, including Mr. Sandler, argue that the cost of terrorism has been raised so high that this retaliation will be more effective than past efforts. At the least, the terrorist organization has been severely disrupted. But Mr. Sandler also predicts that the impact, if more durable than most retaliatory efforts, will be temporary at best.</p><p>Thus the best hope of preventing terrorism is to focus on terrorists' resources. A war on terrorism should provide ample means to find and confiscate terrorists' money, and make future financing more difficult. It should also be directed at undermining the training and recruiting of terrorists, including encouraging nations not to harbor terrorists.</p><p>International cooperation is crucial in a war against terrorist resources. The Bush administration has made efforts in this direction. But these analyses suggest the efforts should be redoubled. Serious cooperation directed at minimizing terrorist resources may well be more effective over time than military action.</p><p>One last point is clear. Among the most important resources of terrorists are unemployment, poverty and underdevelopment. There is deep controversy among economists about the economic determinants of terrorism. But terrorist recruits are often unemployed males. Deep-seated grievances also motivate recruits. If focusing on resources is the best strategy, economic aid and fostering development strategies should be integral parts of it.</p><p>At the least, we should be clear-eyed about the probable costs and benefits. Maybe most important, economic analysis of these emotional issues can help us remain objective. A simple eyeballing of the data on terrorism, without sophisticated statistical interpretation, can be highly misleading.</p><p>Photo: The aftermath of an American missile attack in 1998 on a suspected terrorist camp in Afghanistan.
