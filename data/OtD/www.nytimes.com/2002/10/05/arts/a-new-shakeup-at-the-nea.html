                    <p>The National Endowment for the Arts is undergoing a quiet but significant shakeup that has led some arts advocates to conclude that federal financing is about to shift even further toward traditional cultural organizations like large museums and classical music ensembles. This would move the agency in a direction long favored by conservatives inside and outside the Bush administration.</p><p>The shift would continue a nearly decadelong trend that has pulled the agency away from supporting the sort of controversial arts projects that has made it a pariah for many politicians in both parties.</p><p>The shakeup centers on a diminution in status for the program directors in charge of the agency's 13 discipline areas, like literature, dance and folk arts. But as with many issues involving an agency often at the center of the culture wars, its import is being intensely watched, particularly by arts groups who fear its effects.</p><p>The restructuring seems especially critical because it has taken place while the agency is without a permanent leader; its last chairman, Michael P. Hammond, died in January after only a week on the job.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Hammond's appointment came after long negotiations between the Bush administration and the Democratic-controlled Senate, which had to ratify his selection and has tended to be more supportive of some of the endowment's requests, even though it is filled with agency critics. The endowment is now being run by an acting chairman, Eileen B. Mason, an administration appointee who did not require Senate approval.</p><p>In an interview, Ms. Mason said the changes were merely efforts to streamline operations as part of a new strategic plan for the agency that includes new mission and vision statements. ''The main motive was to create units that support the agency's four goals,'' Ms. Mason said. They are artistic creativity and presentation, access to the arts, arts education and arts partnerships.</p><p>''I thought it was important to align the organization to support our goals,'' she said. ''I thought it would be good in terms of how responsive we can be to arts organizations.''</p><p>In another interview, Victoria Hutter, the agency's spokeswoman, said the changes came in response to a general mandate from the White House instructing all agencies to tighten their operations. Ms. Mason said the changes would become effective in January.</p><p>But critics outside the agency say the move presages a change in financial priorities that accommodates conservative values. The directors of the various disciplines at the agency will report to two coordinators who were previously in charge of the museum and classical music discipline areas and are expected to favor groups representing those subjects, these critics say. Their concern is that the structure sets up an artistic pecking order and minimizes the directors whose areas tend to be less traditional, more multicultural and sometimes more provocative.</p><p>''It's a huge alarm for us,'' said Steve Zeitlin, executive director of City Lore: the New York Center for Urban Folk Culture in Manhattan, which has received funds from the endowment's folk and traditional arts program, one of the agency's discipline areas. ''It's the first sign that the agency is being reorganized in order to highlight art forms that the executive branch wants to see reflected -- an emphasis on classical music and large museums, which are of course the safest and most established art forms.''</p><p>The program directors are widely considered the creative hearts of the agency, representatives of arts specialties nationwide who also recommend those who serve on the peer review panels that select grant recipients.</p><p>''Basically, they're trying to make policy by downgrading,'' said Nick Spitzer, a folklorist and the host and producer of a New Orleans-based public radio show, ''American Routes,'' which explores the origins of popular music. ''They are trying to anesthetize and reduce this agency, and that's troubling.''</p><p>Ms. Hutter said the reorganization would make the agency's administration more effective. ''It's about trying to be more efficient so we can better serve our constituents,'' she said.</p><p>The reorganization will not mean salary reductions for the program directors, but if they leave, they will be replaced by people earning less, Ms. Mason said. Every two years, program directors are evaluated for renewal.</p><p>Several council members, grant recipients and former endowment officials said they were surprised to see the agency undergo such a significant transformation in the absence of a permanent chairman who had Senate approval.</p><p>The changes were instituted by Ms. Mason, 59, who began her tenure at the agency as senior deputy chairwoman in November 2001.</p><p>Ms. Mason, who previously worked for the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is a violinist who was vice president for grants at the Montgomery County Arts and Humanities Council in Maryland.</p><p>She is not the only conservative endowment official appointed by the Bush administration. Ann Guthrie Hingston, the agency's director of White House and Congressional liaison, was also a national program director at the Best Friends Program, which encourages sexual abstinence among low-income girls. The program was founded by Elayne Bennett, wife of William J. Bennett, the conservative author and former secretary of education.</p><p>According to one former endowment official, it was Ms. Hingston who tried last December to delay approval of a grant for a California production of ''Homebody/Kabul,'' Tony Kushner's play about a British woman who disappears in Taliban-era Afghanistan. The grant was ultimately approved.</p><p>Ms. Hingston did not return a call seeking comment.</p><p>Some inside and outside the agency are concerned that the lower status for the program directors will cause defections and make it more difficult to attract top talent to the positions. Although Mark Robbins stepped down as the agency's program director of design, a recent organizational chart has no designation for a vacancy to replace him. But Ms. Mason said, ''We expect to recruit for that position.''</p><p>So far, many legislators seem unaware of the changes. And members of the National Council on the Arts, which ultimately forwards grant recommendations to the endowment's chairman, also seem in the dark.</p><p>''It struck several of us as unusual that an acting chairman would be making what seems to be a comprehensive organizational change when she's not the chairman,'' said a council member who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Normally that is something an interim chairman doesn't do.''</p>                </div>
