But mavericks say just the opposite -- sever all links to the past and leap into the void. Lenora Champagne, a playwright, performance artist and teacher, has made a career balancing between both camps. While the most personal questions inform her work, her career itself could not be farther from Ms. Champagne's hometown roots in Port Barre, La., population 2,000.    There is plenty of evidence affirming her choice. After collecting a string of New York state grants to write plays and monologues, and several fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ms. Champagne recently won the Royal and Shirley Durst Chair in Literature from Purchase College, where she is a professor. The award means a lighter course load this year, a salary increase and financial support for a new production, this one involving Purchase students.  ">

                    <p>THE old rule in creative writing is tell what you know, mine your past for material. But mavericks say just the opposite -- sever all links to the past and leap into the void. Lenora Champagne, a playwright, performance artist and teacher, has made a career balancing between both camps. While the most personal questions inform her work, her career itself could not be farther from Ms. Champagne's hometown roots in Port Barre, La., population 2,000.</p><p>There is plenty of evidence affirming her choice. After collecting a string of New York state grants to write plays and monologues, and several fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ms. Champagne recently won the Royal and Shirley Durst Chair in Literature from Purchase College, where she is a professor. The award means a lighter course load this year, a salary increase and financial support for a new production, this one involving Purchase students.</p><p>The theoretical link between teaching and performance is often noted by academics who liken classroom give-and-take to the connection between an actor and his audience. Ms. Champagne actually lives these themes. Onstage, she engages viewers with sly asides, feeding off their laughter; in class, she encourages young playwrights-in-the-making to quiz her about their work -- as opposed to the other way around.</p><p>''She's an amazing teacher, very much about interaction,'' said Craig Melzer, 21, a senior in drama studies at Purchase, who has taken classes with Ms. Champagne for four years. ''She's very honest without trying to take you down -- she'll rip apart a scene but not make you cry about it.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Melzer, an aspiring actor-writer, said Ms. Champagne's course ''Performing the Self'' was among the best he has taken.</p><p>Perhaps this is because Ms. Champagne, a diminutive woman with a gentle manner, remembers vividly what it felt like to be searching, to have something to say and no forum in which to say it. The oldest of nine children from a Cajun family in southwestern Louisiana, she got herself into Louisiana State University on a scholarship and graduated, extra-quick, with a degree in English. Her mother expected that this would lead young Lenora straight back home to a job at the local high school. Ms. Champagne, instead, set out for Manhattan. She wanted to become a painter.</p><p>''My family didn't speak to me for days after I announced I was leaving,'' she said. ''They never accepted that I was going to be an artist. They said, 'Do you get paid?' Not until I was on television, as a guest on 'Sonya Live' did they start to come around.''</p><p>The television appearance actually had little to do with Ms. Champagne's work. She was invited on during the firestorm that ensued in 1990 when four prominent artists were denied grants by the National Endowment for the Arts for work that was considered obscene. Ms. Champagne, meanwhile, had won a grant.</p><p>''When people hear 'performance art,' they think of Eric Bogosian or maybe Karen Finley,'' said Ms. Champagne, referring to the angry ranting and scatological acrobatics that characterized such work in the late 1980's. ''But that's not what I do.''</p><p>There were long years in obscurity before television came calling. For many of them, Ms. Champagne was a secretary, believing that making photocopies for editors at Supermarket News might lead to a writing career. It did not. She moved on to similar work at New York University as a way of gaining free tuition for graduate studies in performance, and eventually found freelance work as a reviewer. Her assignment: writing about artists like Spalding Gray, who were creating theatrical monologues from their own lives. The light bulb came on.</p><p>''That kind of work had a real sense of urgency to me,'' she said. ''I truly believe you can use a personal event to illuminate something in the society at large, and by then I was approaching my 30's, feeling finally that I had something to say and maybe now I had found the form to say it.''</p><p>In the early 1980's Ms. Champagne plunged full force into New York's bubbling downtown art scene and began making art, in addition to writing about it. Her first solo piece, ''Getting Over Tom,'' was personal, intimate and funny, an accurate predictor of all that would follow -- plays and monologues dealing with relationships, womanhood, abortion and childbirth. Her current work in progress, ''Mother's Little Helper,'' is about the sexuality of girls.</p><p>''My subject is the domestic -- sort of interior still-lives,'' Ms. Champagne said, in an interview at her office at Purchase. She is 50 now, a mother since the age of 43. She has taught full time since 1999 at Purchase, where she started as an adjunct instructor in 1990.</p><p>Her students too find her comfortingly maternal -- a tough, honest critic with a soft touch.</p><p>In a recent playwriting class, students presented scenes based on a newspaper article. It concerned a woman who shot two former classmates as they exchanged wedding vows, and Ms. Champagne wanted scenes of the moments before or after that event. Her students came up with an amazing array -- the shooter as a lesbian lover of the bride, chatting with a bartender before pulling out her gun; the shooter as a subject of gossip years later, at a high school reunion. One scenario showed the bride-to-be primping with a girlfriend minutes before walking into tragedy.</p><p>That kind of acknowledgement of the real world has won Ms. Champagne admirers in the classroom and the faculty lounge, onstage.</p><p>''She is a highly individual and original artist with a very distinct theatrical voice,'' said Gari Laguardia, dean of the School of Humanities at Purchase, who helped select the Durst Chair winner. Shirley Durst, a trustee of the Purchase College Foundation, has been a longtime supporter of the school, financing scholarships and even attending classes from time to time. She created the endowed chair, Purchase's first, in memory of her late husband, Royal.</p><p>The award aims to support artists whose work connects the liberal and performing arts, and it was open to artists across the country. In the second year of the award's existence, the Purchase committee found their candidate close to home. The first Durst Chair winner was Mitch Berman, a professor now at San Jose State University, whose Purchase project was creating a hypertext literary magazine.</p><p>Ms. Champagne plans to use her award stipend producing a piece she wrote, ''The Singing: A Cyberspace Opera,'' with Purchase's voice, drama and technology students.</p><p>The former country girl may be an award-winning artist and respected scholar but in the classroom, Ms. Champagne is just Lenora.</p><p>''I find teaching to be a great complement to what I do,'' she said. ''It's such an exchange, and there is something important about having a link to the younger generation, about having a place to put all this knowledge that I've gained.''</p><p>Photos: Lenora Champagne, center, with her students at Purchase College.
