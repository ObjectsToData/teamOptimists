But few in this particular fix can bring themselves to take effective remedial action.</p><p>It might be comforting to know that professionals have similar problems. In the lexicon of library science, managing such unwieldy growth is known as weeding. It's the closest most New Yorkers will ever get to gardening.</p><p>The city library system offers two opposing models to emulate: the research libraries, like the flagship on Fifth Avenue, which rarely discard anything, or the many branch libraries, where collections are tailored to patrons' tastes. Both approaches have committed advocates.</p><p>''We must conceive of the library as a channel through which books pass on their way from the publisher to the incinerator,'' the librarian G. Hardin declared in an edict issued in 1947.</p>                </div>

                    <p>If Hardin is library science's Draco, a mildly zealous researcher named Stanley J. Slote may be its Darwin. Mr. Slote, while still a doctoral student, pioneered the notion of precisely monitoring patterns of usage in libraries. Over the next 18 years, some of them at Queens College, he lobbied tirelessly for the dispassionate use of statistical data to counter the vaguely humanistic laissez-faire attitudes typical of library life.</p><p>Mr. Slote's opus is ''Weeding Library Collections,'' a much-cited classic of sorts first published in 1973 and now in its fourth edition. It can be found on the shelves of libraries throughout the nation, casting a dour eye upon patrons and librarians alike.</p><p>As Mr. Slote saw it, collections could be separated over time into two stark categories: read and unread. Books that hadn't been touched in years were just taking up space, a library's scarcest commodity. Without intervention, their number will steadily grow, cascading from the shelves in waves, threatening to engulf even the largest libraries.</p><p>Mr. Slote wasn't the first to worry about such a flood.</p><p>In 1902, Charles W. Eliot, the president of Harvard University, called for vast regional repositories of ''dead'' books to be created across the country. Eliot's words are included in ''Landmarks of Library Literature,'' a modern noncirculating reference work of note.</p><p>Rarely requested or otherwise aging material, these experts agreed, must be removed to a remote storage area, far from the public eye. In extreme cases, they should be eliminated.</p><p>Weeding is now widely regarded as necessary, but the idea still rattles many. Some value the serendipitous discovery, and the increasingly arcane art of wandering, aimlessly, in the stacks. For these readers, relevance is overrated.</p><p>''If just one person requests a particular book every 50 years, we want to have it on hand,'' says Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library. He is speaking of the research facilities, particularly the system's magnificent humanities library. Its five million books are housed in 88 miles of shelves, extending underneath the whole of Bryant Park, between 40th and 42nd Streets. Lounging visitors thus relax directly above what the library calls the nation's memory.</p><p>It's a book lover's dream.</p><p>The writer Nicholson Baker, fervent advocate of library preservation, believes that a necessary symbiosis exists between home and public libraries. ''Libraries were invented so that individuals wouldn't have to own everything they might sometime want to read,'' he says. ''Our trust in libraries makes it possible for us to throw things away.''</p><p>New York's humanities library diligently acquires 150,000 new books a year. Arrangements have been made to create an additional off-site storage center that will eventually house several million more books. The new site should provide enough room to take the library into the year 2075 or so.</p><p>Some have always resisted attempts to depersonalize the subject. In the 1930's, debates erupted in journal articles like ''Do We Want a Library Science?'' Many librarians decided that they didn't. C. Seymour Thompson, for one, deplored what he called a cold approach to librarianship. He argued that librarians were more like artists than laboratory workers and ought to rely on intuition rather than rules.</p><p>Much of the contemporary library science concerns itself with the psychology of weeding: how to overcome the reluctance, sometimes even shame, that committed custodians of the printed word experience when stripping a book of its call slip.</p><p>The distress has engendered a kind of peer support movement on the Internet, where one can find extensively referenced posts on weeding from all over the country. Betty Jo Buckingham, a consultant in Iowa, advocates the brusque ''bag and tag'' method in a 1994 report written for the state Board of Education. She counsels queasy colleagues to drop a few discards in each wastebasket every day, or just toss them into lunchroom garbage cans, where the remains of wayward meals will effectively thwart any impulse to rescue and retrieve.</p><p>Ricki Nordmeyer, a librarian at the Skokie Public Library in Illinois, has contributed a role-playing skit first performed for the American Library Association's 2000 Annual Conference. It offers anxious weeders a model of how to move through the process, with suggested rejoinders to such hypothetical assertions as ''You can never have enough Sartre.''</p><p>Books that don't move at the Brooklyn branches are ferried to the Central Branch, where they are sometimes placed on sale. There's a tiny room with an A.T.M. off the lobby where the public can buy the books for a dollar. Among the volumes recently available for acquisition: three copies of the 1998 edition of ''Impeachment: A Handbook''; a 1955 biography of Napoleon III; one copy each of ''The Crash of the Millennium'' (1999), ''Eastern Europe in the Soviet Shadow'' (1973) and ''Conversations With Capote'' (1985); and one copy of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' heavily annotated by Renee, a student, in 1985. One can infer from her comments that Renee seems to have liked Romeo, and that her attention began to wander somewhere in Act III, when elaborate heart doodles appear in the margins.</p><p>But books that don't circulate or sell at the Central Branch go down to ''the deck,'' a nether region from which most never return. Which is not to say they are not missed. Last year, the library handled 13,400 requests for items from this bookish Bermuda Triangle.</p><p>Maybe all one can say unequivocally is that some works ought never to be weeded, like ''Children and Their Books'' by Howard Claude Lewis, published in 1938 and reissued just once, in 1952. It has vanished from the city's public libraries but can still be found in the university collections of New York University and Columbia.</p><p>This slim children's book quotes the likes of Voltaire and Thomas &agrave; Kempis as it introduces young readers to the joys and rigors of the bookish life. Don't crack the spines, it cautions, hold on with both hands and lose yourself in a book that you love. Devotion is further fostered in the book's closing exhortation: ''If you haven't already started to build a library of your very own, begin to do so at once.''</p><p>But be warned. That's how a lifetime of book tending begins.</p><p>Photos: Books overflow shelves and tables at a public library branch in the Bronx. (Bernie Nunez)(pg.
