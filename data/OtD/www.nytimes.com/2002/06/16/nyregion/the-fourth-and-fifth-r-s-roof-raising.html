                    <p>After seven years, 200 students and thousands of hours of sawing, drilling and painting, the schoolhouse is finally complete. It will be officially dedicated at 3 p.m. tomorrow.</p><p>The schoolhouse project began in 1995 as part of a required course for all seniors. The course, known as Long Island Studies, focuses on the local environment and combines the humanities with construction work, all led by three teachers, one each from the English, social studies and technology departments.</p><p>The schoolhouse cost about $50,000. The North Shore School District budgeted $6,000 each year, and donations made up the $8,000 difference.</p><p>The schoolhouse is a copy of the one that once stood on the site of the Glenwood Landing Fire Station. It originally housed students from kindergarten through the eighth grade, but it was converted to a firehouse in 1907 and demolished 20 years later to make room for a new firehouse. The firehouse kept the original school bell, which was recently donated to North Shore High for its replica.</p><p>For students and teachers, the seven-year project was a continuous learning experience, said Bruce Fichtman, the course's technology teacher. First came the research. ''We looked at a series of old photographs of the schoolhouse and scaled them to size by studying the proportions of people standing in the doorway and counting the lines of siding on the outside,'' he said. ''Then we visited the few remaining schoolhouses on Long Island. We think our 1,100-square-foot schoolhouse is pretty accurate.''</p><p>Next came the construction. ''We had to teach the kids everything, starting with safety and how to hold a hammer,'' Mr. Fichtman said. ''I had never put down pine flooring before, so we all had something to learn.''</p><p>The interior is as close to authentic as possible, including the pine floor, the wainscoting and the pot-bellied stove. It heats the building but burns gas, not the coal that would have been used 150 years ago. Other modern touches were the tempered glass, now required for school buildings, and fire and burglar alarms.</p><p>During the course of construction there were many challenges. ''For the first few years when there were no walls, students worked through the winter, putting up siding in rain and snow,'' said Robert LaBlanc, the project's English teacher.</p><p>At the end of each school year, graduating seniors passed the torch to the next class. ''Students who graduated have come back to see the progress that their successors have made,'' Mr. Fichtman said. ''I have always invited them to roll up their sleeves, grab a hammer and join in.''</p><p>This year's students did the finishing work: installing the shutters, building the chalkboard, teacher's desk and podium, and painting the exterior. Pamela LaTorre, 17, is one of the students who was delighted that the building was not completed in 2000, as originally projected.</p><p>''Since I was in fifth grade and they started building the house, I've wanted to be a part of it,'' she said. ''I never did any of this kind of work before, and it's been an amazing experience. We're a part of history, and this is huge!''</p><p>For the teachers who have been working with their students on the schoolhouse, its completion is bittersweet. ''It's very emotional to see it all coming to an end,'' said Lisa Minicozzi, the social studies teacher involved in the project. ''But we're excited that we'll actually be able to use the classroom for our Long Island Studies course. The kids can feel proud that they built their own classroom.''</p><p>But there won't be much time for reflection. Already in the works for the class of 2003 is the next project: building tables and chairs for the schoolhouse.</p><p>Photos: Students finish the shutters, top, for the one-room schoolhouse they built, above right.
