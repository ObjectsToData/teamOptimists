Now, with help from the Connecticut Humanities Council, a plan for Brown's birthplace is being developed by the Torrington Historical Society and the Torrington Branch of the University of Connecticut.</p><p>Whether martyr or terrorist, Brown remains the most important historic figure Torrington has produced, in the view of Mark McEachern, executive director of the Torrington Historical Society, and David Bennett, president of the historical society. In recent years, the historical society, which now owns the site, and the University of Connecticut's Torrington campus, which abuts the Brown property, have attempted to revive interest in Brown.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In August, the two groups received a $9,000 grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council to develop what Mr. McEachern calls ''an interpretive plan for the birthplace'' and in September, 15 people representing a variety of disciplines such as history and landscape architecture came up with a proposal.</p><p>They envision a half-mile walking trail that would focus on Brown's life and a mile-long ''natural history loop that would run from the home lot through the woods and highlight the site's natural history and previous land use,'' according to the proposal. Signs will tell of Brown's ''formative experiences in Torrington and how they came to produce in him the kind of man who would take the kinds of actions that he did.'' The site would also explore such themes related to Brown's life as slavery and abolition, religious beliefs of the period, the relationship of the emancipation movement to contemporary life and how social reform is best effected in a democracy.</p><p>Recreating the original salt box has been discussed but, as the preliminary plan noted, ''there are some compelling reasons (beyond financial) not to follow that course, including the fact that Connecticut has many authentic houses that represent the period of John Brown's youth.'' The site is already a stop on the state's African-American Freedom Trail.</p><p>Brown was born in Torrington, but made his reputation as a fanatical enemy of slavery in other places. History remembers him for leading a murderous guerrilla band dedicated to preventing Kansas from becoming a slave state and for his seizure of the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Va., where he was captured by Col. Robert E. Lee, tried for treason and hanged. John Brown's body has been, as the Civil War song says, ''a-mouldering in his grave'' in North Elba, N.Y., since 1859.</p><p>But Brown's roots are in Connecticut and how to mark his place in Torrington history has been a matter of concern and controversy since a group of prominent citizens gathered at his birthplace on May 9, 1900. They came that day to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brown's birthday and to make plans to purchase and restore his early childhood home, a seven-room salt box, as a historic shrine.</p><p>Brown had lived in the house just five years when his father, a tanner and shoemaker named Owen Brown, joined the Connecticut migration to Ohio's Western Reserve but ''Brown frequently returned to Torrington to visit family and friends and purchase livestock from a local farmer,'' Mr. McEachern said. ''On at least one occasion,'' he added, ''he spoke to students at the local school.'' The community leaders of 1900 founded a support group called the John Brown Association, refurbished the house and hired a live-in caretaker who also conducted tours. During its first years as a historic site, the birthplace attracted hundreds of visitors, many from foreign countries, according to Mr. Bennett, who wrote a book about of the birthplace called ''The John Brown Birthplace.'' But the John Brown association ''had no infrastructure and was severely underfunded,'' Mr. Bennett wrote. ''It is startling that the association had as much success as it did.''</p><p>The success story abruptly ended in 1918 when a chimney fire destroyed the house before a ''fire automobile'' could get to the scene, according to an account in The Torrington Register. After the fire, interest in the birthplace waned and during the Depression, the land was leased by the Torrington Water Company. As part of the deal, the water company agreed to maintain the 100-by-60-foot house site, erect a stone identifying marker and pay the property taxes.</p><p>About the time Brown's birthplace was destroyed, his reputation was undergoing a similar alteration. Long considered a martyr and hero in the North despite the tactics he employed in his crusade to abolish slavery, historians began to take a more critical look at Brown in the 20th century's first decades.</p><p>When Brown was hanged, the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison said in a eulogy, ''Today, Virginia has murdered John Brown; tonight we here witness his resurrection.'' In 1910, Garrison's grandson, Oswald Garrison Villard, the editor of The Nation and a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, published a revisionist biography that portrayed Brown as ''a muddled, pugnacious, bumbling and homicidal madman,'' according to Mr. Bennett's book. ''American Heritage'' magazine published an article in 2000 about Brown entitled ''The Father of American Terrorism.''</p><p>The changing views of Brown's legacy would be reflected in the exhibits envisioned by Mr. McEachern. In addition to a a permanent display at the historical society in downtown Torrington, he says material at the birthplace site will suggest that tourists visit the Torrington Post Office where there are murals depicting Brown's childhood.</p><p>''The murals were done by Arthur Covey of Harwinton, an artist subsidized by the W.P.A. artists' and writers' project during the Depression,'' said Mr. McEachern. ''It's a little ironic that a government that hanged Brown would pay to immortalize him in murals 75 years later.''</p><p>Photos: A sign in front of the site of John Brown's birthplace, above and right, commemorates the life of the abolitionist. Below right, a group from the Y.M.C.A. met at the site in 1894 before the house was destroyed in a fire in 1918. Two groups are now trying to revive interest in Brown and his birthplace.
