                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Last September Stevens required the 80 freshmen who were planning to major in the sciences or systems planning and management to buy Atari 800 microcomputers. In their freshman mathematics class, an introduction to computing, they were taught to write programs they could use in other courses.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In chemistry they created three-@dimensional models of molecules and observed differences as they changed the equations. In physics they built cannons on their computer screens and mathematically measured the trajectories of shells. And in calculus they drew charts of the solutions to give them a picture of equations.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''You can buy machines and create a lot of ballyhoo,'' said Roger Pinkham, a professor of pure and applied mathematics who taught the freshman course. ''We set about to get the curriculum changed.'' Inquiries From 200 Colleges        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Colleges preparing to impose similar requirements in the next few years are watching the experience at Stevens. Administrators at the 113-year-old coeducational engineering school, which is across the Hudson River from Manhattan, say about 200 colleges have asked about the program.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Drexel University in Philadelphia will require its freshmen to have microcomputers by January 1984. Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh has similar plans for freshmen who enter in 1986.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    On campus, the arrival of the microcomputer has given rise to a new way of looking at academic problems. Some professors say that with computers they have covered in the freshman year what they would not have taught until the sophomore year. Some students, who at first used their computers to knock asteroids off the video screen, now say they would rather program than play games.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Educators talk of making computers as accessible as books. And as lines at campus computer centers stretch from dusk to dawn, they add that the vision has become a necessity. Fiscal Aid for Students        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Computer dealers discounted the cost of computers to Stevens students because of the volume of sales. The college also contributed money to reduce the cost further. The Atari 800's, which retail for $1,200, cost freshman $747 last year. Next year's freshmen will pay $1,800 for a more advanced machine, the Digital Equipment Corporation's PC325, which retails for $4,415. For those students who cannot afford the computer, Stevens helps arrange loans and grants.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    For most students - like David Kaufman, a computer science major from Highland Mills, N.Y. - the computer has been a boon. Mr. Kaufman said, ''We covered more material than other courses because we had the computer with us all the time.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Scott Klodzieski, a physics major who lives 20 miles from the campus, in Carteret, said, ''If I had to come up to Stevens every time I wanted to use the computer, it would be a real hassle.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    With a grant from the National Science Foundation in 1977, Stevens began revising its curriculum to incorporate microcomputers. In some courses, open to all freshmen, computers were not required, though the 80 freshmen who had the machines were free to use them if they wished. But the course plan for the freshman mathematics class, taken only by the 80 students with microcomputers, was changed markedly to include computer work.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Rather than focus on programming style, the course became much more applications-oriented,'' said Dr. Moeller, the associate dean.  Dr. Moeller said that the course gave the students a series of programs, a tool kit they could use in other courses. Slide Rule Replaced        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The tool that aided an engineer 15 years ago was a slide rule,'' Dr. Moeller noted. ''That then became a calculator. The advent of smaller computers has led to the generation of English-like computer languages, and now you no longer have to specialize in computers to use the computer.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Students who used computers in other mathematics courses said they had learned more about the equations they were solving.  ''When I was writing a program, I had to explain it to the machine,'' said Rajeev Krishnamoorthy, a computer science major from Stamford, Conn. ''It's really a great way to learn. I'll never forget what I had to teach the machine.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dr. Pinkham, who taught freshman mathematics, said that the students working with computers covered material they normally would not have gotten to until their sophomore year.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The computer, Mr. Klodzieski said, ''took a lot of the number crunching away from you so you could concentrate on the theory.'' An Aid to Simulations        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The students also used the computer to simulate laboratory experiments for their physical science courses. ''You don't want to remove the hands-on experience in a laboratory,'' Dr. Moeller said, ''but there are some things you can't do physically; you can simulate the whole thing on a computer.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''With a ruler and a piece of paper, you can do two-dimensional drawings,'' he noted. ''But on a computer you can do three dimensions and then rotate the object.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Changing the courses to accommodate the computer also meant changing the way professors taught them. ''There are some faculty members who do not know how to use the computer and are not interested,'' Dr. Moeller said. That will change by next year, he said, when courses in every major subject at Stevens will be adapted to computers.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In political science, Dr. Moeller said, students will use computers to graph voting trends and opinion poll results. In acoustics, they will build rooms on their computer screens and bounce electronic impulses off the walls. And in English, history and other humanities courses, they will use word processing programs to write their papers. A Part of Daily Life        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    One of the intentions of Stevens in requiring the computers was to encourage students to think of them as educational tools to be used outside the classroom as well as inside, Dr. Moeller said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    And this is exactly what some Stevens students did.  Mr. Klodzieski used his computer in a part-time job for a local jewelry store to keep track of precision machinery manufacturers. Mr. Kaufman used his microcomputer to compile grocery lists for his family.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The Stevens students who did not buy microcomputers last fall developed a new vocabulary to describe those who did. Those using the computers were called ''chipheads'' (the microcomputer's circuitry is on silicon chips), ''technerds'' and ''spams'' (systems planning and management).        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Wendy Kaufman, Mr. Kaufman's wife, used another term to describe her husband: ''obsessed.'' ''David's obsessed with his computer,'' she said. ''I'll wake up at 3 A.M., and he'll be in the study still programming. It's like living with a person obsessed with football.''        </p>
