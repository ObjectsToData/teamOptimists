                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Last year there was one strongly polemical book, Jonathan Schell's ''The Fate of the Earth,'' and although nothing this year approaches its passionate intensity, the list does contain an erudite, idiosyncratic and revealing chronicle of the century, ''Modern Times,'' by the conservative thinker Paul Johnson.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Most remarkable perhaps is the appearance on the list of two murder mysteries - of a high literary order, to be sure, but Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ''Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' and Umberto Eco's ''The Name of the Rose'' are nonetheless murder mysteries.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Finally, although the list traditionally does not include translations of classic works, it was thought proper in this introduction to single out for its special excellence Stephen Mitchell's ''The Selected Poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As usual, the descriptions that follow have been adapted from reviews published in The Book Review. On page 16 another list begins of more than 200 notable books published this year; the longer list does not include the 13 titles below.  CATHEDRAL    By Raymond Carver. Alfred A. Knopf.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    There are artists who reach the strange by staying with the ordinary. Raymond Carver, an American writer now in his mid-40's, has been writing stories for some years that create this effect. His settings are American towns, semiindustrial and often depressed. His characters, plebeian loners struggling for speech, now and then find work as factory hands and waitresses. The action skids across the troubles of daily life and then, through some eerie turn of chance, collapses into failed marriages and broken lives. Familiar enough on the surface, these stories leave one with tremors that resemble the start of a mental breakdown. ''Cathedral,'' Mr. Carver's third collection, after ''Will You Be Quiet, Please?'' and ''What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'' shows a gifted writer struggling for a larger scope of reference, a finer touch of nuance.  DURING THE REIGN OF THE QUEEN OF PERSIA    By Joan Chase. Harper &amp; Row.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The queen of this novel's title is Gram, an intractable old tyrant who has cursed and battled through a difficult life in rural Ohio and won her way to the promised land of bingo games and movie matinees and who rules her household of women - daughters and granddaughters - with a hard and knobby hand and a tongue like a rasp. ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' is a Norman Rockwell painting gone bad, the underside of the idyllic hometown, main-street, down-on-the-farm dream of Middle America. This first novel takes its place with other important contemporary fictions that depict the condition of the American woman.  THE NAME OF THE ROSE    By Umberto Eco. A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/ Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Imagine a medieval castle run by the Benedictines, with cellarers, herbalists, gardeners, librarians, young novices. Imagine that, one after the other, half a dozen monks are found murdered in the most bizarre ways. Imagine that a learned Franciscan is sent to solve the mystery and at the end of the narrative it turns out that all these horrible crimes were committed for highly ethical and cultural reasons. These are the bare bones of a first novel by a famous Italian practitioner of semiotics (the philosophy of signs and symbols). ''The Name of the Rose'' has been a best seller in Europe and, shortly after the publication of this excellent translation by William Weaver, went to the top of the best-seller list here. Imagine!  ATTLEE    By Kenneth Harris. W. W. Norton &amp; Co.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    This excellent new biography does justice to the remarkable politician who was England's Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951. With skill and grace, Kenneth Harris's book traces the transformation of the young man about London into the social reformer who became the leader of the Labor Party. (Incidentally, it also succeeds in that notoriously difficult literary task, the depiction of a happy marriage - Attlee's lasted 42 years.) Attlee has been easy to underestimate; but Churchill, who knew him well from his participation in Churchill's wartime coalition Cabinet, called him ''an honorable and gallant gentleman, and a faithful colleague who served his country well at the time of her greatest need.'' THE PRICE OF POWER    By Seymour M. Hersh. Summit Books.        </p>

	data-url="http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/books/editors-choice-the-best-books-of-1983.html" 
	data-description="  For the 16th time, in its annual Christmas issue, The Book Review has chosen what it considers the best books reviewed in its pages during the previous year. This year there are 13 titles; last year's list had 12, the same as 1981. The split of last year's 12 was five books of fiction and seven of nonfiction. This year the edge is reversed - seven fiction, six nonfiction.   Are there discernible trends? Two collections of short stories appear this year (Raymond Carver's and Alice Munro's) as against one last year (Ann Beattie's). Three large and distinguished collections of stories (Bernard Malamud's, William Trevor's and Sean O'Faolain's) were omitted on the grounds that all or most of them had appeared in book form before.   This year no autobiographies are cited, while last year two were (Kate Simon's and Wole Soyinka's), as well as Henry Kissinger's second volume of political memoirs."></div>
