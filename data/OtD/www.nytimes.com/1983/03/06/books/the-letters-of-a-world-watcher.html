    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  THE LETTERS OF HENRY ADAMS Volume One: 1858-1868.  Volume Two: 1868-1885.  Volume Three: 1886-1892.  Edited by J.C. Levenson, Ernest Samuels, Charles Vandersee and Viola Hopkins Winner.  Illustrated. 1,857 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press.  $85; $100 after April 30.   HENRY ADAMS is our favorite teacher. He is the fierce and fascinating tyrant of eighth grade who made us learn the facts, the enigmatic professor who made us think about them. He is intimidating, infuriating, sometimes dead wrong -and we are totally loyal to him. We feel the force of his person as well as of his mind.    He brings his own books to class, among them his masterpiece, ''The Education of Henry Adams,'' which is one of the most distinguished books ever written by an American. Now, 65 years after his death, this new edition of ''The Letters of Henry Adams,'' supplanting all earlier editions, puts the teacher back in our lives. It is Adams's voice that we hear in the book. The editors have been lavish in the number of letters included and have neither printed letters to Adams nor intruded with notes that are more than spare identifications of people and issues.">

Now, 65 years after his death, this new edition of ''The Letters of Henry Adams,'' supplanting all earlier editions, puts the teacher back in our lives. It is Adams's voice that we hear in the book.

                    The letters are arranged chronologically and episodically to form an autobiography. His boyhood with his grandfather, John Quincy Adams, is understandably missing, and so are his days as a student at Harvard; the years after 1892 have been left for future volumes. Much of the rest of his life is in these three volumes: his travel in Europe from 1858 to 1860; his impressions of Washington in the months just prior to the Civil War; his work in England during the war, when he was secretary to his father, Charles Francis Adams, the diplomat charged with keeping Britain from aiding the Confederacy; his experience of the Reconstruction era in Washington; his years as a teacher at Harvard, when he also edited The North Atlantic Review; and finally his return to Washington to watch the world and write.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    His letters to his wife, Marian Hooper Adams, when she was in Boston in 1885 with her dying father make harrowing reading, since we know that eventually she will commit suicide; but there is no new clue here to that grim mystery. After her death, the letters reveal Henry Adams straining to get back in touch with his correspondents and then escaping on trips to Japan and other distant places. His letters from Samoa and Tahiti in 1890-91 could make a book of anthropology, fascinating in its own right: ''The sensation of seeing extremely fine women, with superb forms, perfectly unconscious of undress, and yet evidently aware of their beauty and dignity, is worth a week's seasickness to experience.'' Adams told John Hay, his friend who was later to be Secretary of State, that ''the effect was that of a dozen Rembrandts intensified into the most glowing beauty of life and motion.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Even if the reader of the private portions of these letters is tempted to speculate whether Adams was sexually attracted to or active with Elizabeth Cameron, a senator's wife, or for that matter with Charles Gaskell in England or John Hay in Washington, he is not likely to be satisfied. Despite familiarity and frankness, the letters are not intimate. Adams is always too conscious of positioning himself, even as he writes to close friends, to achieve intimacy; yet there is a nicer Henry Adams here than the one we have known before. He is relaxed and affectionate in ways the judgmental and distanced tone of ''The Education of Henry Adams'' did not disclose. In a country house in England in 1861, when he was 23, his 15-year-old sister and 13-year-old brother were homesick: ''We had a large child's party Christmas evening at which I made myself conspicuous. I had no intention of doing so, but I found it was going on very coldly and so I pitched in and laid myself out.'' He was constantly pitching into life.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''You know I'm ambitious,'' he writes in one of his strikingly admonitory letters to his mother, ''I needn't remind you of it; not on my own account, but as a family joint-stock affair. Now papa has got to make himself indispensable; not only in the wild-beast pen, but out of it too.'' The goal is the Adamses' old Washington home, the White House: ''It's all infernal nonsense, you and papa sacrificing yourselves for the good of your country; I tell you, you're doing nothing of the sort, at least if I can help it; you must take just as many honors as you can get and what's more, you must work to get them and be glad that the paths of duty and of ambition combine for you; for most people they lie in contrary directions.'' Henry was invoking an 18th-century Puritan concept of working to prove one's virtue, which in turn would be rewarded by a populace seeking to be well governed. The problem was that these Adamses were smack-dab in the middle of the 19th century.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    When it came to living in that century, Henry Adams was as much a prisoner of his very rich mother's moneyed aristocracy as of his father's unsurpassable political legacy. From Dresden, on his grand tour, he wrote his mother, ''I had the pleasure of informing Billy Howe the other day that his father's mill had tumbled to pieces.'' The collapse of the Pemberton cotton mill in Lawrence, Mass., killed 88 workers. Howe's response to the news was ''It's always been a rotten concern, that mill,'' and Adams seemed troubled less by the loss of life than by the sensationalism surrounding the incident. He sneered at The New York Herald's talk of ''white slaves''; he could not put himself in the place of the people of Lawrence.        </p>
