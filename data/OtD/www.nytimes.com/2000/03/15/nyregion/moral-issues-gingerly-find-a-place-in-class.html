    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In Kiersten L. Johnson's 10th-grade humanities class, students have been asked to consider the nature of forgiveness.     Ms. Johnson pops a tape into the VCR, and the 15 students, seated in two facing banks of metal desks, watch a news report by Bill Moyers on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They become somber as a black victim of police torture tells how he was dangled from a window of the room where Steve Biko, the anti-apartheid leader, was fatally beaten. The tape rolls on and the moral issues become more complex. A white South African faces three young black militants who killed his wife in a fusillade of bullets and grenades during a 1993 attack on a church in a Cape Town suburb.  ">

They become somber as a black victim of police torture tells how he was dangled from a window of the room where Steve Biko, the anti-apartheid leader, was fatally beaten.

A white South African faces three young black militants who killed his wife in a fusillade of bullets and grenades during a 1993 attack on a church in a Cape Town suburb.</p><p>As they shift edgily in their seats, the students grapple with a thorny question: Is it morally easier to pardon the actions of the militants than the white police torturers?</p><p>''They should have whipped him and let him off,'' says Diaby Moyabi Mohammad, 16, referring to the black militant who apologized for the attack on the church. ''Some people just wanted to hear the truth.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Clay Dawson, 15, disagrees. ''I think you should take responsibility, but there should also be punishment,'' he says, arguing that the man should face the death penalty. ''Because without punishment there are no consequences.''</p><p>Ms. Johnson's class, at the East Side Community High School on the Lower East Side, is nearing the end of the kind of course that once would have been confined to explicitly religious schools or private institutions like the Ethical Culture School. Her students are not only learning world history and politics, but how to make hard moral choices in a world of both apartheid and terrorists fighting its injustice, a world of Holocausts and of bystanders who never protested its horrors.</p><p>This particular program is called Facing History and Ourselves and is one of a number being taught in the New York City region as moral education has found a growing place in American schools.</p><p>Part of the upsurge reflects a growing concern about school violence. ''Every time you hear of a school shooting, there's a renewed cry for this,'' said Joan F. Goodman, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>But the push for lessons in ethics also comes from educators, who perceive an unsettling shift in students' attitudes and behavior, said Karen E. Bohlin, director for the Center for the Advancement of Ethics and Character at Boston University,</p><p>''Many teachers testify that there is a growing lack of respect for other human beings in terms of language, basic courtesy and bullying, just a real breakdown in healthy relationships,'' she said.</p><p>In 1998, New York State received a $1 million federal grant for ''character education,'' to support pilot programs in four school districts to teach ''caring, self-reliance, trustworthiness, and open-mindedness,'' among other virtues. When the programs begin in September, said Vito J. Borello, president of Every Person Influences Children, the nonprofit group that is managing the funds, it will be the first time the state has specifically focused on teaching morality. Yet New York is certainly not the first state to enter the game. Character-building classes are now officially mandated in 10 states -- up from 5 just two years ago -- and such classes are encouraged in 7 other states, said Esther F. Schaeffer, executive director of the Character Education Partnership, a national nonprofit group.</p><p>In New York City, the Facing History curriculum, which usually centers on the Holocaust but also has classes on the apartheid and civil rights eras, is being taught in about 200 of the city's public and private schools, including the Center School and the Dual Language Middle School, both on the Upper West Side.</p><p>Such lessons are not without their critics. Some feel the promotion of virtue in the classroom can easily border on religious teaching.</p><p>''The right is worried it's going to be excessively liberal and permissive humanism,'' Professor Goodman said. ''The political left is concerned that schools are going to start preaching to children.''</p><p>Others criticize some of the programs for having a prefabricated curriculum, which may produce orderly behavior but does not build character. ''Many of those commercial programs even have multiple-choice questions to measure kids' absorption of the correct virtues,'' said Alfie Kohn, an author who writes about moral education. ''Some contain simplistic little stories, at the end of which the lead character says, ''I will never be selfish again.'''</p><p>Ms. Johnson took a weeklong course with Facing History, a nonprofit organization created in 1976 by Margo Stern Strong, a middle school teacher in Brookline, Mass. Its programs now reach about a million students each year. Ms. Johnson said she wanted to incorporate moral lessons into her curriculum not for fear of gunfire in her classroom, but because these particular teaching methods would strengthen her humanities course work.</p><p>''They're in 10th grade and all they care about is their existence,'' she said. ''We're using that natural curiosity about the self and the identity and layering it on the curriculum to get them interested.''</p><p>The students grapple with material that is tough for many adults, like the degradation of European Jews that eventually led to the Holocaust, or attacks on black children who integrated schools in the South.</p><p>In most cases, the students are asked to turn history's lessons on themselves. One of Ms. Johnson's students, Ila K. McCall, 15, said her teacher asked her whether she viewed the homeless any differently after learning that the white South African government once regularly seized property from blacks.</p><p>''I was looking at people on the street and saying 'Yuck,' '' she said. ''But now I know that just because you live on the street doesn't mean you're not a person.''</p><p>Ms. Johnson's students did not go home with a featherweight load. As she concluded her section on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Jason A. Pizarro, 16, remarked that some black militants were probably responding to the conditions in which they were reared.</p><p>''If you grow up in violence, is that an excuse for violence?'' Ms. Johnson asked as the class came to an end. ''Most of us have witnessed violence in our own lives. If we think that's the case, how do we ever achieve peace?''</p><p>Photo: Students in a class at East Side Community High School in Manhattan confronting moral issues raised by a student teacher, Rachel Rear, facing away from the camera.
