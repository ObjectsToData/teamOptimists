What looks and smells like a science experiment going on in there actually is a science experiment. But it doesn't belong to Viviana Risca. Hers was made famous last week in Washington, where she won the nationwide Intel Science Talent Search (and a $100,000 scholarship) with a project that encoded a secret message in a strand of DNA.    Except for her fanciful misconception that a computer mouse would resemble a little gray rodent rather than a blob of plastic (the reality, which descended in seventh grade, was a disappointment), Ms. Risca, a 17-year-old senior, has always been a glutton for fact-finding. She first became ''a research groupie'' in ninth grade, on the day a light went off in her head, Edison-style. It happened during a class next door in Room 36 when she figured out how DNA works: ''I fell in love with biology.''  ">

She first became ''a research groupie'' in ninth grade, on the day a light went off in her head, Edison-style. It happened during a class next door in Room 36 when she figured out how DNA works: ''I fell in love with biology.''</p><p>But she was a sophisticated student -- at her request, her maternal grandparents read her Greek myths  -- before she arrived in New York in 1992 from Drumul Taberei, near Bucharest. A nervous third grader who spoke only fragmentary English, she was installed in the same grade, no remedial arrangements necessary, in the Sachem district, on Long Island, just two days after saying goodbye to her home, friends and, chaperoned by grandma, taking her first international flight.</p><p>''My parents threw me right into the waters -- they indoctrinated me pretty early that hard work is what matters,'' says Ms. Risca. Her parents, both engineers, left Romania ahead of her in 1991 and pursued workaholic schedules here so that she and her younger sister, Anca, would want for nothing, especially not a college education.</p>                </div>

                    <p>For Ms. Risca, a worrywart who recalls obsessing about the bill for her college education ''ever since I was in elementary school,'' winning the top Intel prize over 39 other finalists has removed an old stress and replaced it with new ones. Which college should she attend, Stanford or Yale or M.I.T. or Harvard or Princeton or . . . you get the problem.  And if she goes to a science school like M.I.T., to pursue a head-spinning double major in computer science and biology, will she miss out on her second passion, the humanities?</p><p>According to her, ''the depressing part'' of being the big winner is this: even $100,000 doesn't take care of the whole enchilada anymore. ''My parents always tell me not to worry,'' she says in her quick, accented English, ''but it's too late for that. I worry. Sometimes I theorize that I should just go and be a farmer in the Great Plains states.'' (That's a carry-over from weekend hikes in the Carpathian Mountains with her grandparents, who taught her to love nature.) Instead, she's on a path that carried five previous winners of the competition to a Nobel Prize; might her inquisitiveness take her that far?</p><p>HARD to fathom; so is that $100,000 scholarship, which she's still not sure she deserves. (Ms. Risca confesses that the Intel project that impressed her most belonged to a Florida girl who, without benefit of a mentor like hers, Dr. Carter Bancroft at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, created a poison for a weed that was choking her community's fields.) ''The way she persevered, that's a great example of a scientist following a theory to the end,'' she says. Then again, Ms. Risca wasn't even sure she deserved the oil paints she got one birthday: ''I'm not that good of a painter.''</p><p>What she is sure about is the impatience that led her to ignore the Nancy Drew books the rest of the third graders devoured her first season in America -- ''Once you've read one Nancy Drew, you've read them all''  -- and sneak to the science shelf for a dose of Isaac Asimov. Then came her determination to find the source of pulsating variables in stars, a quest that took her to Columbia University's physics library at 14, the same year she spent her summer as an N.Y.U. lab intern trying to isolate a gene in a parasitic organism.</p><p>''I went through a phase where I wanted to be a fashion designer,'' she says. ''I had Barbie dolls, but I didn't play with them. I made beaded outfits for them. But I outgrew it.''</p><p>Now Ms. Risca, a poetry aficionado, dresses like a 50's beatnik, long hair pulled into a massive bun, plenty of black on black, the hem of her jeans artfully frayed above a pair of low-top sneakers. You were expecting, perhaps, a lab coat, horn rims, sensible brogues, and a fistful of dissecting tools? Not for this fan of Frost and Plath who edits her school's literary magazine when she's not busy cooking up experiments for the contests that dot the calendars of teenage scientists.</p><p>''Pressure from all over the place,'' Ms. Risca observes of the new phenomenon of the teenage science nerd as a hot recruiting property. And the competitions! Her Intel booty, the scholarship check and a laptop computer, are still in the mail, but Ms. Risca has already entered this week's Long Island Science and Engineering Fair at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p><p>The new project is called ''Image Scale Estimation Using Genetic Programming in Java.'' To Ms. Risca, who believes silicon chips will be outmoded soon, Java is computer-speak, not a beverage. ''It has to do with the way robots see,'' supplies Phyllis Serfaty, a biology teacher who heads the special science research program Ms. Risca entered in her sophomore year. ''But it's way out of my league. That's Viviana.''</p><p>Photo: Viviana Risca, 17, won a $100,000 scholarship with a science project.
