                    <p>With a swiftness that has surprised and puzzled educators, law schools have gained the advantage in their long tug of war with business schools for the attention of corporate America's future elite.</p><p>At virtually every top business school, the number of applicants fell last spring, and some of the numbers are startling. At the University of Chicago, they dropped 24 percent. At Cornell, the dip was 23 percent, and at Stanford, it was 18 percent.</p><p>As a result, it is considerably less difficult to gain admission to some business schools than it was a few years ago, and school officials have relaxed their requirements for work experience and stepped up overseas recruiting efforts.</p><p>Law schools, meanwhile, are enjoying their first increases in applications since the 1980's. Around the country, about 77,000 people submitted applications to begin law school this fall, up about 3 percent from the previous year. It was the second consecutive increase, reversing a string of declines that accounted for a 30 percent overall drop from 1991 through 1998, according to the Law School Admission Council.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Deans say they have no clear explanation for the trend, which comes after a decade in which interest in M.B.A. programs grew as rapidly as stock market values did. Top schools became so selective that at some the admission rates plummeted, to 10 percent or even less. At the same time, law schools became less selective, thanks to a growing perception that there were too many lawyers anyway.</p><p>Now, however, the tight labor market is causing companies to offer promotions and perquisites to retain young employees who otherwise would be considering business school. ''The opportunities presented to someone like me are pretty compelling right now,'' said Brian D. Gale, 27, an equities trader in Boston who is trying to decide between going to the University of Chicago full time and working for a bank in Cleveland that has offered to pay his tuition if he enrolls in Chicago's weekend program. ''It's difficult to take a timeout for two years. People are saying, 'I'll postpone it until there's a need for me to go back.' ''</p><p>In fact, graduate programs of almost all types, from the humanities to the physical sciences, have received slightly fewer applications over the last five years than in the past, according to the Council of Graduate Schools. The number of people in their late 20's has decreased, and the strong economy has given them many alternatives.</p><p>Law schools have managed to defy the demographics, though. Unlike many business schools, they accept students directly from college, before the students have employers who are desperate to keep them. The law schools also seem to be benefiting both from corporate America's willingness to hire lawyers for a broader range of jobs than in the past, deans say, and from a heightened interest in public-interest work after a long economic expansion.</p><p>Nevertheless, the speed and the size of the turnaround for business and law schools defy easy explanation, administrators say. ''Nobody I've talked to has come up with a really good reason for this, and we're all concerned,'' said Mary Miller, the associate dean for admissions at the Stern School of Business at New York University, where the number of applicants fell by 15 percent this year.</p><p>The flip-flop in the schools' fortunes is connected, graduate-school experts say, because both draw from the same pool: ambitious young adults who have decided against careers in specialties like medicine and engineering and opted instead for degrees that can be passports to wealth and success in just about any business field.</p><p>Last summer, the first warning signs that M.B.A.'s were losing some luster came as applications fell at schools that traditionally attract people interested in technology, like Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>This year the bad news is widespread. In fact, the list of schools where applications dropped, and acceptance rates spiked, reads like a magazine ranking of the country's best programs: Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, M.I.T., Columbia, Michigan, Virginia, Northwestern, Duke. The declines are steepest among American applicants. Yale's business school appears to be the only big-name M.B.A. program with an overall increase each of the last two years.</p><p>Officials at the schools themselves tend to be among those who blame the hot economy. ''Career prospects generally look so good now that a two-year investment in an M.B.A. may be hard for many to justify,'' said Richard L. Schmalensee, the dean of the Sloan School at M.I.T. Indeed, the combination of tuition costs and lost wages can easily exceed $200,000 over two years.</p><p>George G. C. Parker, an associate dean at Stanford, added, ''There are a lot of people who feel things are moving so quickly that they don't want to stand on the sideline.''</p><p>It doesn't help that managers at some large companies are discouraging younger workers from going to business school, in part because they cannot spare them in the current job market and in part because they want to keep them a safe distance from Internet start-ups.</p>                </div>
