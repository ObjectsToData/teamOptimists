                    <p>Gov. George W. Bush has decided on former Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney as his running mate and is expected to announce his selection on  Tuesday, a highly placed Republican official said tonight.</p><p>Mr. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, did not tip his hand as he arrived at the Texas governor's mansion this afternoon after a weekend of deliberations. But only formalities appeared to stand in the way of an announcement.</p><p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's director of communications, said in a statement ''Governor Bush tonight said he has made his decision on a vice presidential nominee but has not notified that individual.'' She said he would notify his choice for the job on Tuesday morning, though she did not say whom he would call.</p><p>And Mr. Cheney has already taken steps to pave the way for his acceptance. Republican officials said there was a strong possibility that the governor and Mr. Cheney could travel together to Wyoming to campaign later in the week.</p>                </div>

                    <p>By choosing Mr. Cheney, a respected party elder who had been running Mr. Bush's vice-presidential search, Mr. Bush made a risk-free and respectable choice that was cheered by many party stalwarts. Mr. Cheney has a wealth of government experience and a resume more far-ranging that Mr. Bush's own six years as governor. It includes a Cabinet stint as defense secretary under Mr. Bush's father during the war in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>By age 34, Mr. Cheney was already White House chief of staff, helping President Gerald Ford with the difficult transition after the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard M. Nixon from office.</p><p>He later became a congressman from Wyoming, rising in party ranks to the leadership post of whip. Though a staunch supporter of President Ronald Reagan and with a conservative voting record, Mr. Cheney was uncomfortable with the sharply partisan style of Representative Newt Gingrich, who was also rising in the party hierarchy.</p><p>Mr. Cheney meets all of Mr. Bush's criteria as someone who could step in as a commander in chief, someone compatible and loyal. Republicans said Mr. Bush's father  had also strongly supported the selection of Mr. Cheney.</p><p>For months speculation over whom Mr. Bush would select had focused on an array of governors and senators as well as former Senator John Danforth of Missouri. But many had some liability.</p><p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, for example, was a strong supporter of abortion rights, a stand that could alienate the party's conservative base. Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma drew complaints from some Republicans that he was too conservative to attract swing voters.</p><p>Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska was not well known. Representative John Kasich of Ohio appeared too boyish. And though some Republicans were pressing for Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Bush's chief primary rival, relations remained raw between the two camps.</p><p>In retrospect, it seems significant that when he named Mr. Cheney to lead his search, Mr. Bush did not rule him out as a possible running mate. But Mr. Cheney himself said he did not want the job. ''I have absolutely no desire to go back to government,'' he said in May. ''I've done that. I am set in my ways at my stage. I'm 59, and I didn't leave anything in Washington. I have no plan, intention, desire, under any circumstances to return to government.''</p><p>Republicans said that Mr. Cheney's thinking turned as he worked closely with Mr. Bush and many in the party asked him to reconsider. And on Friday, Mr. Cheney emerged publicly as the front-running candidate after he flew to Wyoming to change his voter registration to avoid a constitutional problem.</p><p>The 12th Amendment bars members of the Electoral College from selecting ''inhabitants'' of their state as both president and vice president. Mr. Cheney, a resident of Texas, also has a home in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</p><p>By then, a senior Republican said, Mr. Bush had already decided Mr. Cheney was his leading choice, but wanted to consider his decision once more over the weekend.</p><p>Mr. Cheney, chairman and chief executive of the Halliburton Company, an energy services and construction concern based in Dallas, told his directors on Thursday that he might be offered the vice presidency.</p><p>Because of a history of three mild heart attacks and bypass surgery, he also took a physical examination and received a clean bill of health. At the request of Mr. Bush and his father, the former president, the heart specialist Denton Cooley reviewed Mr. Cheney's medical records and said he was fit for the job.</p><p>Even before Mr. Cheney's announcement, Democrats and their allies lost no time trying to use him to cast doubt on Mr. Bush and were already looking over his long voting record. Mario M. Cuomo, the former governor of New York, suggested during an appearance on MSNBC that the selection of such a seasoned hand in government was actually an admission ''of a kind of inadequacy.''</p><p>Republicans, however, said Mr. Cheney's credentials were impeccable and that he had something to offer to all factions of the party.</p><p>His anti-abortion voting record should appeal to conservatives. He has Pentagon experience that will resound with Republicans most interested in national security matters. And the role of his wife, Lynne, as a former head of the National Endowment for the Arts should resonate with party moderates.</p><p>On the other hand, Mr. Cheney is not an electrifying candidate, and even today speculation swirled that Mr. Bush had made one last effort to persuade retired Gen. Colin L. Powell to be his running-mate. The talk was firmly denied by Mr. Powell's spokeswoman, Peggy Cifrino, and by some of Mr. Powell's closest party allies and advisers.</p><p>Asked if General Powell had softened his position at all on not running, Richard L. Armitage, a close friend of the general and a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan administration, said, ''Absolutely not, although the general continues to  support the governor wholeheartedly.''</p>                </div>
