                    <p>When Dick Cheney came to an elementary school here today to discuss the education policies of the Bush-Cheney ticket, he brought along a secret campaign weapon: his wife, Lynne V. Cheney.</p><p>Her role became clear almost the moment they arrived, as they were ushered into that classic campaign photo-op, a classroom full of eager children. But it was Mrs. Cheney who gamely worked the crowd of fourth graders as she and her husband, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, toured a computer laboratory in front of the cameras. ''Looks like Windows, huh?'' she asked a student, before rooting for several others who were playing a math game.</p><p>Mr. Cheney, meanwhile, stood quietly in the center of the room, his hands in the pockets of his pinstripe suit, smiling. After a few moments, he turned to the teacher, Viola Perez, and made his own brand of small talk. He asked her about the federal Title I program for disadvantaged students and training for teachers.</p><p>Mr. Cheney came to the school today to promote Gov. George W. Bush's ideas on education. He called for maintaining high educational standards and high expectations, keeping control of schools at the local level and more resources for schools. The campaign chose Kingsbury Elementary School as a backdrop because school administrators from there traveled to Mr. Bush's home state, Texas, several years ago to study its education system and, in some respects, to emulate it.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I think education this year is probably going to be the single most important issue that is likely to be addressed in the national campaign this year, and that is as it should be,'' Mr. Cheney told an education forum in the school library. ''I can't think of a more important purpose than having a debate and discussion over education and looking for ways to improve it. That should indeed preoccupy us as we choose our national leaders.''</p><p>Even before he addressed the group, he turned to Mrs. Cheney, who served as the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in the Reagan and Bush administrations and later became a conservative commentator. ''It was my great good fortune, of course, to marry my high school sweetheart,'' he said, introducing her.</p><p>It was not the first time Mrs. Cheney has taken an active role in the campaign. When the couple visited a school near Columbus, Ohio, earlier this month, Mrs. Cheney handed her husband a book, ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar,'' and asked if he would like to read it aloud.</p><p>''Why don't you go ahead and start,'' he demurred. ''You're the expert on reading.''</p><p>Today Mr. Cheney did not address one of the more contentious education issues, Mr. Bush's call for using vouchers to send children in poor public schools to private schools, a move that Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, opposes. The issue was seized upon by a small band of protesters who stood outside the school.</p><p>In a brief news conference, Mr. Cheney was asked about whether voters concerned about rising oil prices would be concerned that he had worked for an oil company (''I was running an energy services and engineering and construction company, not an oil company''), whether he was too conservative to win in California (''Some of my best friends are California conservatives'') and his views on immigration (''We welcome legal immigrants.'')</p><p>At times today Mr. Cheney displayed some of the dry humor that he is known for. As he introduced Representative Jerry Lewis, a California Republican who joined Congress the same year Mr. Cheney did, he said, ''I would also point out now Jerry has real influence as the chairman of one of the key appropriation subcommittees, and I'm striving to find a position of somewhat lower significance.''</p><p>Photo: Dick Cheney, with wife, Lynne, in the background, chatted yesterday with poll workers in Jackson, Wyo., before voting in the state's primary.
