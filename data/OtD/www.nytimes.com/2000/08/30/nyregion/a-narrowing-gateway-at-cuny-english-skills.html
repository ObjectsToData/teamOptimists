There was Rachid Haddoury, a husky 27-year-old who had two years of college in Morocco before coming to New York. He wanted to enroll as an engineering student at City College of New York. Yet when placement tests showed that his English reading skills were still weak and his writing only somewhat better, it was not clear whether the college would offer him classes in English as a second language. It has begun to discourage students from enrolling until their English is better.   ">

                    <p>Business was brisk on Monday at City College's English as a second language department -- the headquarters for teaching English to foreign students.</p><p>There was Rachid Haddoury, a husky 27-year-old who had two years of college in Morocco before coming to New York.

Yet when placement tests showed that his English reading skills were still weak and his writing only somewhat better, it was not clear whether the college would offer him classes in English as a second language. It has begun to discourage students from enrolling until their English is better.</p><p>Next came Vladimir Cuevas, a 19-year-old student from the Dominican Republic who studied English at an Educational Opportunity Center run by the State University of New York on 125th Street in Manhattan for a year. He did not do well on the reading or writing tests either. When he came to register this week, he was told he needed better mastery of English before he could enroll.</p><p>They were part of the steady stream of students on Monday in the office of Elizabeth Rorschach, the department chairwoman, sitting in the black armchair next to her desk, pleading to join intensive classes in English as a second language, or ESL as they are known.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Teaching immigrants has long been a primary mission for City College, where fewer than 44 percent of the incoming freshmen in 1998 spoke English as their first language.</p><p>But the number of ESL students has been slipping at City College and other parts of City University in recent years. Last fall, City College filled 17 class sections with foreign students learning English. Now it is budgeting for five.</p><p>College officials say they are seeing fewer applicants needing English as a second language. But the college is also barring students like Mr. Cuevas, the Dominican student with relatively low scores, saying the students need to improve their English first.</p><p>In the past, such students might have been allowed to enter the college and spend several years improving their English while they took college courses. Now, City University has told its senior colleges to reduce the number of less-prepared students, and that includes some of those who know the least English.</p><p>Under university policies being phased in this year and next, the senior colleges are not supposed to enroll students who have not passed all of the university's placement exams. Foreign students who have attended high school outside the United States are exempt from this policy; they may enroll without having passed the reading or writing placement tests. But once enrolled, they are given only a year to pass them.</p><p>That is a stiff challenge for foreign-born students weak in English. So the colleges are trying to enroll those who are closest to passing and are advising the rest to attend adult education classes or the university's language immersion institutes, so they can improve their English without using up financial aid or struggling so hard in classes.</p><p>Although the new university guidelines are not binding on City College until next year, college officials have been trying to improve the caliber of their student body anyway. When officials judged which students had a real chance of  academic success, those not ready for the highest level of ESL were not included.</p><p>''The question I'm asking is whether students will be better served by going to a CUNY language immersion program or somewhere else, where they won't use up their financial aid,'' said James F. Watts, a history professor and acting dean of humanities and arts at the college.</p><p>He said he and other officials were trying ''to bend over backwards to admit anybody who has a chance of success.''</p><p>But success can be difficult to predict, especially for students who speak limited English. And there are disagreements at the college and around the university about how selective to be.</p><p>City College is one of the few in the United States where the unit that teaches English to nonnative speakers is a full department with hiring and firing responsibility, rather than just a program or an arm of the English department. It once offered three levels of language instruction to foreign students. Five years ago, it sliced off the bottom level, after CUNY established language immersion institutes for students with only the barest grasp of English. This year, college officials decided to remove another level, leaving classes only for the most advanced English students.</p><p>Dr. Rorschach and some other faculty members are concerned that the university standard is unnecessarily harsh; because teenagers and adults can take many years to perfect a new language, it may be unfair to judge students by whether they are likely to pass university placement tests in a single year, they say.</p><p>Sheldon Weinbaum, a City College mechanical engineering professor, said a recent review of the approximately 1,500 students who had graduated from the engineering school between 1993 and 1997 found that nearly a third had required instruction in English as a second language.</p>                </div>
