                    <p>Cooper Square Press. $30.</p><p>''Contention,'' the Irish say, ''is better than loneliness.'' In ''Memoir: My Life and Themes,'' Conor Cruise O'Brien retraces what must rank as one of the most remarkable lives of the 20th century. A man of eccentric brilliance, O'Brien made his impact felt in postcolonial Africa, in American academia, in trans-Atlantic journalism and, above all, in Irish politics. In each manifestation of his career he achieved important things yet, in his own account, he consistently fell short of what his brilliance promised. And each manifestation was marked by a contentiousness that seems to have resulted partly from his commitment to principle and partly from a personality rooted in the contradictions of Irish history. This book offers a portrait of a man of intense family feeling, yet also of a public figure in whom contention and loneliness, finally, became the same thing.</p><p>The book begins: ''The first sound I can remember is a series of booming noises which woke me up. The cause of the noise was the bombardment of the Four Courts Dublin beginning at 4:07 a.m. on Wednesday, June 28, 1922. I was then 4* years old.'' That noise marked the start of the Irish Civil War, the intra-Irish conflict that followed on the Irish rebellion against Britain. Setting former comrades against one another, it was a brutal instance of the enmity of small differences. Young O'Brien, knowing nothing, was in the thick of it. His family was famously of the Irish Catholic establishment. His mother, nee Kathleen Sheehy, is memorialized by James Joyce in ''The Dead,'' and his grandmother, ''the wife of Mr. David Sheehy, M.P.,'' has a walk-on in ''Ulysses.'' His godfather, Conor O'Brien, ran guns for the progenitor of the Irish Republican Army. One uncle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, was one of the martyrs of the 1916 Rising; another, Tom Kettle, died at the Somme in a British uniform.</p><p>Such contradictions soon enough marked Conor's own life. Reared as a passionate Catholic nationalist, yet he was educated mainly in the schools of the Protestant ascendancy, matriculating at Trinity College, Dublin, where he made a point of refusing to stand for ''God Save the King.'' As a young man he broke with the Catholic Church, but that ''made it doubly important to me not to leave the nation.''</p><p>O'Brien's work in his nation's foreign service, and then a stint with the United Nations in Congo in the early 1960's, led to a sharpening of his opposition to imperialism in all its forms. He was intimately involved with the African struggle against diehard colonialism, a conflict that cost the lives of Patrice Lumumba and Dag Hammarskjold. His account of that story here is gripping and instructive, a useful reminder of the deep history behind headlines from Africa today. O'Brien's reputation as a staunch foe of colonialism led to his appointment in 1962 by Kwame Nkrumah as vice chancellor, effectively president, of the University of Ghana. ''Respect for truth,'' O'Brien declared there on one occasion, ''intellectual courage in the pursuit of truth; moral courage in the telling of truth: these are the qualities of a real, of a living university.'' O'Brien served in Ghana for three years.</p><p>From 1965 to 1969 he was Albert Schweitzer professor of the humanities at New York University, but then, as if fated to do so, he returned to Ireland and plunged into politics. Nineteen sixty-nine was the year when the contemporary round of ''the Troubles'' broke out, with Catholic civil rights demonstrations culminating in the British massacre of 13 Catholics in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972. A new, ever more brutal incarnation of the I.R.A. was born of this conflict. O'Brien recognized in both the means and the ends -- A Free and United Ireland'' -- of Catholic republican nationalism a version of imperialist disregard for the rights of a vulnerable minority, in this case the Protestants of Northern Ireland. He made such nationalism his mortal enemy. In his campaigns for the Dail Eireann, the Irish parliament in Dublin, in his academic lectures and in his writing, O'Brien so firmly set himself against the prevailing ideology of his own people that eventually he would embrace the identity of Unionist for himself. He would end by expressing, as he does here, admiration for the most divisive anti-Catholic figure in Ireland, Ian Paisley.</p><p>In a classic replay of the enmity of small differences, O'Brien reserves his most biting criticism for another Irish politician who, from 1969 on, bravely set himself against the violence of extreme Catholic nationalism, John Hume. It was Hume who found a way to bring the I.R.A., through its political entity, Sinn Fein, to the negotiating table. O'Brien is dismissive of Hume's accomplishment, and of the entire peace process that unfolded under his leadership. That process culminated in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, of which the Irish people overwhelmingly approve, but which O'Brien rejects as a propitiation of ''those who have murdered and maimed.'' That the agreement has stopped the murdering and maiming, and that it has led to a functioning Protestant-Catholic government in Belfast, could seem not to matter to O'Brien, but it is important to note that this memoir's bitter skepticism toward political developments in Northern Ireland is two years out of date. Luckily for Ireland, those two years, notwithstanding the difficulty of the agreement's actual implementation, strongly refute O'Brien's grim analysis.</p><p>Yet whether he would affirm his role in it or not, O'Brien, precisely through his eloquent contrariness, has played a decisive role in the coming of a hopeful new era to his nation. When few in Catholic Ireland dared to do so, he defended the rights of Protestants, pointed to positive aspects of the British presence in the North, called upon London to live up to its historic responsibility and challenged the Catholic Church's dominance in the South. He blasted the cult of political martyrdom that fueled the I.R.A., and ridiculed the sacred myths of 1916 as so much green fog. In all of this, he became a living example of a new political and cultural pluralism in Ireland, proof that the day of narrowly defined, and confining, patriotism was over. That a figure whose heritage so centrally wraps him in the mists of Irish nationalism should have used his incomparable rhetorical gifts, broad political experience and powerful personal history to dispel those mists puts Conor Cruise O'Brien's mark as much on Ireland's future as on its past.</p>                </div>
