Gone are government-sponsored performances by symphony orchestras and by giant opera companies that once entranced audiences abroad.</p><p>''People think that we are movies, hamburgers and other cliches,'' Evelyn S. Lieberman, a State Department official, said recently, lamenting the decline and speaking in anticipation of a conference today at the White House on culture and diplomacy.</p><p>Ms. Lieberman, who is the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, said she hoped the White House conference would give impetus to the establishment of an endowment in the State Department made up of private donations to make up for the money that Congress has declined to approve.</p><p>Bills to establish such an endowment were introduced in Congress this year by Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. The Leach and Biden bills were introduced too late in the Congressional year for any votes or hearings.</p>                </div>

                    <p>President Clinton said at the conference that he supported the Leach-Biden approach to an endowment.</p><p>Presenting American arts through embassies, he said, ''will become more and more important.''</p><p>Mr. Clinton, who presided over a panel discussion in the East Room, cited examples of the nation's culture serving positive ends, from the Glenn Miller Orchestra and others sustaining Allied morale during World War II, to a poster in Poland that depicted his favorite movie, ''High Noon,'' in which Gary Cooper's sheriff's badge had been supplanted by a Solidarity pin, to the use of Superman comic books to teach Bosnian children to avoid land mines.</p><p>In response to Mr. Clinton's observation that American popular culture was known throughout the world, another panelist, Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who was the Nobel laureate in literature in 1986, suggested that the United States was itself too insular.</p><p>''Yes,'' Mr. Clinton replied. ''It's a two-way street.''</p><p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, seated next to Mr. Clinton, said that ''our cultural diplomacy programs are central'' to American foreign policy and she called for financing them ''more generously.''</p><p>Hillary Rodham Clinton made a brief appearance at the session and said that ''the arts foster a civil society'' even when ''the dialogue of diplomacy is strained.''</p><p>As Mrs. Clinton turned to leave the room, Mr. Clinton explained why she was not staying. ''Hillary got a culturally excused absence,'' he said. ''She's going to sign copies of her new book.''</p><p>If a measure to set up a cultural endowment that Mr. Clinton favors is ever approved, it will come after Ms. Lieberman, a Clinton appointee, is gone.</p><p>Asked how the proposal for an endowment could get past the opposition of lawmakers like Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has led the opposition to the existing national endowments for the arts and humanities, Ms. Lieberman smiled and said, ''He doesn't have to pay for it.''</p><p>As sketched out by Ms. Lieberman and her senior adviser, Bill Barrett, the proposed endowment would receive tax-deductible donations from individuals and corporations and use the money to send American arts groups abroad.</p><p>''Everything that we do is a reflection of our vast, diverse culture -- quilts, dancers, jazz, all of our arts traditions,'' Ms. Lieberman said. ''We have unbelievable things to say that are not just violence in the movies.''</p><p>The endowment, Ms. Lieberman said, would be independent of the government and would make the decisions on what or who to send.</p><p>Rick Ruth, Ms. Lieberman's chief of staff, said: ''First there was a slow and then a precipitous decline in money for cultural and artistic programming. The thing that is often lost in these discussions is that we conduct all of these programs for the good of the U.S. government.''</p><p>Statistics provided by Ms. Lieberman's office show that in constant dollars education and cultural spending by the United States abroad has declined by 72 percent since 1990, to $1.8 million today from the equivalent of $6.4 million in 1990. The high-water mark of such spending abroad was the $8.05 million spent in 1993.</p><p>''Among the things that an ambassador can get out of cultural programming are access to groups not easy to reach by other means, people who don't want to engage in a political discussion with the United States,'' Mr. Ruth said. ''But they will turn out to a cultural performance -- a single piano player, a jazz quartet or a choral performance of 'Porgy and Bess,' which was done recently in Cairo.</p><p>''There was a time when the United States would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to send, for example, the New York Philharmonic or the Martha Graham Dance Company. Foreign governments really turned out for these things and looked on them with great favor, and it spoke to our values.''</p><p>Mr. Ruth said the State Department still had limited funds to send performers abroad, but added, ''A jazz quartet would be about the largest we could do.''</p><p>One large performing arts group, Dance Theater of Harlem, performed in Beijing and Shanghai this month, but Mr. Ruth said that was largely because the dance company had raised most of the estimated $500,000 for the tour from its own benefactors, with the State Department providing only $80,000.</p><p>Ms. Lieberman said the Chinese government had asked why the United States was sending a black troupe.</p><p>''Because they are terrific dancers and represent the diversity of America,'' Ms. Lieberman said she answered.</p><p>Chart: ''BY THE NUMBERS -- Less Support For Culture Abroad''  Spending by the federal government on educational and cultural affairs overseas.
