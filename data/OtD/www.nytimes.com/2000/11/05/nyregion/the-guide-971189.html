    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content=" Best Bet      Musicians and dancers from abroad give the weekend an international flavor. It all begins Friday when the Veryovka Ukrainian National Dance Company -- 75 singers, dancers and musicians strong -- brings its vibrant folk program to Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville at 8 p.m. (516) 299-3100. Saturday requires choices: between the Ballet Gran Folklorico de Mexico at 8 p.m. at the Van Nostrand Theater on the Brentwood campus of Suffolk Community College (631) 665-4350; ''Dipawali 2000,'' a two-day festival featuring ''The Three Padma Vibhusans'' -- the Pandits Jasraj, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Kelucharan Mahapatra -- at 7 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday at Pandit Jasraj Auditorium on Jerusalem Avenue in Hempstead (516) 367-0963, and, from Ireland, via the Long Island Traditional Music Association, Sean Quinn and the Quinn Brothers and Brendan Dolan, at 8 p.m. at the Brush Barn on Middle Country Road in Smithtown (631) 226-6385.    Jewish Art?      Does Jewish art exist? And if so, what is it and how does Jewish identity intersect with other identities? Focusing on these and other questions, the University Art Gallery at the State University at Stony Brook on Thursday opens ''Intersecting Identities: Jewishness at the Crossroads,'' a group exhibition that looks at different approaches to Jewishness using different visual styles and different media -- painting, sculpture, video, photography and installation -- to explore ideas of Jewishness. Accompanied by a Humanities Institute conference, ''Jewish Visual Culture: Images, Identities, Intersections,'' on Thursday and Friday and a film series, the exhibition, after an opening reception at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, runs through Dec. 16 (631) 632-7240; conference: (631) 632-7765.    American Indian Culture      Two programs this week recreate American Indian culture. Today, from noon to 2 p.m., the Great South Bay Y.M.C.A., West Main Street in Bay Shore, offers ''Circle of Friends,'' a program featuring dancing and drumming by the Youngblood Singers and storytelling by Frank White Eagle. It's free but donations of non-perishable food are requested (631) 665-4255. The Vision Quest Educational Media Center stages a two-day ''Sixth Annual Native American Video Cultural Festival'' at the Park Avenue building complex in Huntington with a video program at 11 a.m. at the New Community Cinema on Saturday, and a performance by the Allegany River Indian Dancers at 2 p.m. next Sunday at the Y.M.C.A. Artists and craftspeople will also be there from noon to 5 p.m. both days. (631) 385-7459.    'L'Universe'      With the help of scientists at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Flying Karamazov Brothers have created a new high-tech, multimedia show, ''L'Universe.'' The zany entertainers bring this ''extravaganza'' to the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University at 7 p.m. today. (631) 632-2787.    Philharmonic Visits      The New York Philharmonic makes its first trip this season across the East River on Saturday to perform Brahms's Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (''From the New World'') at 8 p.m. at Tilles Center in Brookville. Christoph Eschenbach will conduct and Glenn Dicterow, violinist, and Carter Brey, cellist, will do the solo honors (516) 299-3100.    Big Numbers      In ''Millions, Billions, Googols and More,'' David M. Schwartz, the author of math books like ''If I Had a Million,'' will tell a family audience everything it ever wanted to know about to such questions as ''How long would it take to collect one million bottle caps?'' or ''How much do a million pennies weigh?'' Courtesy of the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, Mr. Schwartz will provide these answers at 7 p.m. Thursday at Molloy College in Rockville Centre (516) 747-0777.    'Hope and Glory'      In ''Hope and Glory -- A Musical History,'' ghosts of war, from the Revolutionary War to Desert Storm, speak and sing in words and music adapted from and inspired by Walt Whitman's work. Based on Whitman's works, the original musical theater piece by Michael Tester, performed by an ensemble of eight, is at 8 p.m. Friday at the Walt Whitman Birthplace on Old Whitman Road in Huntington Station (631) 427-5240.    Civil War Home Front      While not actually meant to mark Veterans Day (which will be commemorated on Saturday at veterans' cemeteries and in parades and ceremonies throughout the Island), an exibition at the Raynham Hall Museum on West Main Street in Oyster Bay deals with war, specifically with the Civil War. The show, ''Our Village Was All Astir: Oyster Bay and the Civil War Home Front'' focuses on the year 1864 as seen by local residents and features uniforms, civilian clothing, diaries, letters, military equipment and photographs. Re-enactors from Company H, 119th New York Volunteers, will be on hand during the opening on Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. to add a living dimension to the exhibition, which runs through next March in the museum's Victorian wing (516) 922-6808.    Celebrating Copland      The celebration of Aaron Copland 100th birthday hits its stride on the Island today with two concerts: Lucas Foss, a friend of the composer, and Continuum, America's oldest chamber ensemble, play ''Copland, the Early Years'' at 3:30 p.m. at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Grace Auditorium (631) 351-3240, and the North Shore Pro Musica plays an all-Copland program at 2 p.m. at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages in Stony Brook (631) 751-0066. On Saturday at 2 p.m., the Huntington Library begins a monthly series of films with original musical scores by Copland with ''The Heiress,'' starring Olivia De Havilland (631) 427-5165. Finally, the Rockaway-Five Towns Symphony Orchestra plays ''Hoe-Down'' from Copland's ''Rodeo Suite,'' along with music by Morton Gould, Brahms and Haydn, at 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Lawrence Middle School on Broadway (516) 365-6857.    Pantomime Circus      In a tribute to the late Lotte Goslar, the legendary dance clown whose mix of theater, dance and pantomime delighted audiences throughout the world, Hofstra University's drama and dance department stages ''Clowns and Other Fools: A Special Edition of Lotte Goslar's Pantomime Circus.'' Choreographed by Lance Westergard, a longtime member of Ms. Goslar's troupe, the production runs from Friday through Nov. 19 at the West End Theater on the Hempstead campus (516) 463-6644.    Free Choices      TODAY -- Taking a close look at the cultural heritage of Freeport's Latino residents, Long Island Traditions holds a Latino Folk Arts Festival from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Freeport Library on South Ocean Avenue. The program features a performance by Luis Cordero y Los Amigos del Amargue and demonstrations of crafts like pinata-, tamale- and pupusa-making (516) 379 -3274.    Pop music dominates the library concert scene with such entries as the Diane Hoffman Trio playing music by Cole Porter at 2:30 p.m. at the Baldwin Library (516) 223-6228; Peggy Cone and Her Gentlemen offering ''Marvelous Movie Music'' at 2 p.m. at the Bellmore Library (516) 785-2990, and Acoustically Incorrect singing the blues at 2:30 p.m. at the South Huntington Library in Melville (631) 549-4411.    FRIDAY -- Now retired and living on the Island, Will Hutchins, an actor, has his memories of being an early television cowboy -- remember ''Sugarfoot''? -- and appearing in films with Elvis Presley and Jack Nicholson. He will share them at 12:30 p.m. at the East Meadow Library on Front Street (516) 794-2570.    SATURDAY -- Malachy McCourt will discuss his writing careerat the Book Revue on New York Avenue in Huntington at 8 p.m. where he will plug his latest, ''Singing My Him Song'' (631) 271-1442.

	data-description=" Best Bet      Musicians and dancers from abroad give the weekend an international flavor. It all begins Friday when the Veryovka Ukrainian National Dance Company -- 75 singers, dancers and musicians strong -- brings its vibrant folk program to Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville at 8 p.m. (516) 299-3100. Saturday requires choices: between the Ballet Gran Folklorico de Mexico at 8 p.m. at the Van Nostrand Theater on the Brentwood campus of Suffolk Community College (631) 665-4350; ''Dipawali 2000,'' a two-day festival featuring ''The Three Padma Vibhusans'' -- the Pandits Jasraj, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Kelucharan Mahapatra -- at 7 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday at Pandit Jasraj Auditorium on Jerusalem Avenue in Hempstead (516) 367-0963, and, from Ireland, via the Long Island Traditional Music Association, Sean Quinn and the Quinn Brothers and Brendan Dolan, at 8 p.m. at the Brush Barn on Middle Country Road in Smithtown (631) 226-6385.    Jewish Art?      Does Jewish art exist? And if so, what is it and how does Jewish identity intersect with other identities? Focusing on these and other questions, the University Art Gallery at the State University at Stony Brook on Thursday opens ''Intersecting Identities: Jewishness at the Crossroads,'' a group exhibition that looks at different approaches to Jewishness using different visual styles and different media -- painting, sculpture, video, photography and installation -- to explore ideas of Jewishness. Accompanied by a Humanities Institute conference, ''Jewish Visual Culture: Images, Identities, Intersections,'' on Thursday and Friday and a film series, the exhibition, after an opening reception at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, runs through Dec. 16 (631) 632-7240; conference: (631) 632-7765.    American Indian Culture      Two programs this week recreate American Indian culture. Today, from noon to 2 p.m., the Great South Bay Y.M.C.A., West Main Street in Bay Shore, offers ''Circle of Friends,'' a program featuring dancing and drumming by the Youngblood Singers and storytelling by Frank White Eagle. It's free but donations of non-perishable food are requested (631) 665-4255. The Vision Quest Educational Media Center stages a two-day ''Sixth Annual Native American Video Cultural Festival'' at the Park Avenue building complex in Huntington with a video program at 11 a.m. at the New Community Cinema on Saturday, and a performance by the Allegany River Indian Dancers at 2 p.m. next Sunday at the Y.M.C.A. Artists and craftspeople will also be there from noon to 5 p.m. both days. (631) 385-7459.    'L'Universe'      With the help of scientists at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Flying Karamazov Brothers have created a new high-tech, multimedia show, ''L'Universe.'' The zany entertainers bring this ''extravaganza'' to the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University at 7 p.m. today. (631) 632-2787.    Philharmonic Visits      The New York Philharmonic makes its first trip this season across the East River on Saturday to perform Brahms's Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (''From the New World'') at 8 p.m. at Tilles Center in Brookville. Christoph Eschenbach will conduct and Glenn Dicterow, violinist, and Carter Brey, cellist, will do the solo honors (516) 299-3100.    Big Numbers      In ''Millions, Billions, Googols and More,'' David M. Schwartz, the author of math books like ''If I Had a Million,'' will tell a family audience everything it ever wanted to know about to such questions as ''How long would it take to collect one million bottle caps?'' or ''How much do a million pennies weigh?'' Courtesy of the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, Mr. Schwartz will provide these answers at 7 p.m. Thursday at Molloy College in Rockville Centre (516) 747-0777.    'Hope and Glory'      In ''Hope and Glory -- A Musical History,'' ghosts of war, from the Revolutionary War to Desert Storm, speak and sing in words and music adapted from and inspired by Walt Whitman's work. Based on Whitman's works, the original musical theater piece by Michael Tester, performed by an ensemble of eight, is at 8 p.m. Friday at the Walt Whitman Birthplace on Old Whitman Road in Huntington Station (631) 427-5240.    Civil War Home Front      While not actually meant to mark Veterans Day (which will be commemorated on Saturday at veterans' cemeteries and in parades and ceremonies throughout the Island), an exibition at the Raynham Hall Museum on West Main Street in Oyster Bay deals with war, specifically with the Civil War. The show, ''Our Village Was All Astir: Oyster Bay and the Civil War Home Front'' focuses on the year 1864 as seen by local residents and features uniforms, civilian clothing, diaries, letters, military equipment and photographs. Re-enactors from Company H, 119th New York Volunteers, will be on hand during the opening on Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. to add a living dimension to the exhibition, which runs through next March in the museum's Victorian wing (516) 922-6808.    Celebrating Copland      The celebration of Aaron Copland 100th birthday hits its stride on the Island today with two concerts: Lucas Foss, a friend of the composer, and Continuum, America's oldest chamber ensemble, play ''Copland, the Early Years'' at 3:30 p.m. at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Grace Auditorium (631) 351-3240, and the North Shore Pro Musica plays an all-Copland program at 2 p.m. at the Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages in Stony Brook (631) 751-0066. On Saturday at 2 p.m., the Huntington Library begins a monthly series of films with original musical scores by Copland with ''The Heiress,'' starring Olivia De Havilland (631) 427-5165. Finally, the Rockaway-Five Towns Symphony Orchestra plays ''Hoe-Down'' from Copland's ''Rodeo Suite,'' along with music by Morton Gould, Brahms and Haydn, at 8 p.m. on Saturday at the Lawrence Middle School on Broadway (516) 365-6857.    Pantomime Circus      In a tribute to the late Lotte Goslar, the legendary dance clown whose mix of theater, dance and pantomime delighted audiences throughout the world, Hofstra University's drama and dance department stages ''Clowns and Other Fools: A Special Edition of Lotte Goslar's Pantomime Circus.'' Choreographed by Lance Westergard, a longtime member of Ms. Goslar's troupe, the production runs from Friday through Nov. 19 at the West End Theater on the Hempstead campus (516) 463-6644.    Free Choices      TODAY -- Taking a close look at the cultural heritage of Freeport's Latino residents, Long Island Traditions holds a Latino Folk Arts Festival from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Freeport Library on South Ocean Avenue. The program features a performance by Luis Cordero y Los Amigos del Amargue and demonstrations of crafts like pinata-, tamale- and pupusa-making (516) 379 -3274.    Pop music dominates the library concert scene with such entries as the Diane Hoffman Trio playing music by Cole Porter at 2:30 p.m. at the Baldwin Library (516) 223-6228; Peggy Cone and Her Gentlemen offering ''Marvelous Movie Music'' at 2 p.m. at the Bellmore Library (516) 785-2990, and Acoustically Incorrect singing the blues at 2:30 p.m. at the South Huntington Library in Melville (631) 549-4411.    FRIDAY -- Now retired and living on the Island, Will Hutchins, an actor, has his memories of being an early television cowboy -- remember ''Sugarfoot''? -- and appearing in films with Elvis Presley and Jack Nicholson. He will share them at 12:30 p.m. at the East Meadow Library on Front Street (516) 794-2570.    SATURDAY -- Malachy McCourt will discuss his writing careerat the Book Revue on New York Avenue in Huntington at 8 p.m. where he will plug his latest, ''Singing My Him Song'' (631) 271-1442.

And if so, what is it and how does Jewish identity intersect with other identities? Focusing on these and other questions, the University Art Gallery at the State University at Stony Brook on Thursday opens ''Intersecting Identities: Jewishness at the Crossroads,'' a group exhibition that looks at different approaches to Jewishness using different visual styles and different media -- painting, sculpture, video, photography and installation -- to explore ideas of Jewishness. Accompanied by a Humanities Institute conference, ''Jewish Visual Culture: Images, Identities, Intersections,'' on Thursday and Friday and a film series, the exhibition, after an opening reception at 6:30 p.m. Thursday, runs through Dec. 16 (631) 632-7240; conference: (631) 632-7765.</p>                </div>

                    <p>American Indian Culture</p><p>Two programs this week recreate American Indian culture. Today, from noon to 2 p.m., the Great South Bay Y.M.C.A., West Main Street in Bay Shore, offers ''Circle of Friends,'' a program featuring dancing and drumming by the Youngblood Singers and storytelling by Frank White Eagle. It's free but donations of non-perishable food are requested (631) 665-4255. The Vision Quest Educational Media Center stages a two-day ''Sixth Annual Native American Video Cultural Festival'' at the Park Avenue building complex in Huntington with a video program at 11 a.m. at the New Community Cinema on Saturday, and a performance by the Allegany River Indian Dancers at 2 p.m. next Sunday at the Y.M.C.A. Artists and craftspeople will also be there from noon to 5 p.m. both days. (631) 385-7459.</p><p>'L'Universe'</p><p>With the help of scientists at the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Flying Karamazov Brothers have created a new high-tech, multimedia show, ''L'Universe.'' The zany entertainers bring this ''extravaganza'' to the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University at 7 p.m. today. (631) 632-2787.</p><p>Philharmonic Visits</p><p>The New York Philharmonic makes its first trip this season across the East River on Saturday to perform Brahms's Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 (''From the New World'') at 8 p.m. at Tilles Center in Brookville. Christoph Eschenbach will conduct and Glenn Dicterow, violinist, and Carter Brey, cellist, will do the solo honors (516) 299-3100.</p><p>Big Numbers</p><p>In ''Millions, Billions, Googols and More,'' David M. Schwartz, the author of math books like ''If I Had a Million,'' will tell a family audience everything it ever wanted to know about to such questions as ''How long would it take to collect one million bottle caps?'' or ''How much do a million pennies weigh?'' Courtesy of the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, Mr. Schwartz will provide these answers at 7 p.m. Thursday at Molloy College in Rockville Centre (516) 747-0777.</p><p>'Hope and Glory'</p><p>In ''Hope and Glory -- A Musical History,'' ghosts of war, from the Revolutionary War to Desert Storm, speak and sing in words and music adapted from and inspired by Walt Whitman's work. Based on Whitman's works, the original musical theater piece by Michael Tester, performed by an ensemble of eight, is at 8 p.m. Friday at the Walt Whitman Birthplace on Old Whitman Road in Huntington Station (631) 427-5240.</p><p>Civil War Home Front</p><p>While not actually meant to mark Veterans Day (which will be commemorated on Saturday at veterans' cemeteries and in parades and ceremonies throughout the Island), an exibition at the Raynham Hall Museum on West Main Street in Oyster Bay deals with war, specifically with the Civil War. The show, ''Our Village Was All Astir: Oyster Bay and the Civil War Home Front'' focuses on the year 1864 as seen by local residents and features uniforms, civilian clothing, diaries, letters, military equipment and photographs. Re-enactors from Company H, 119th New York Volunteers, will be on hand during the opening on Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. to add a living dimension to the exhibition, which runs through next March in the museum's Victorian wing (516) 922-6808.</p><p>Celebrating Copland</p>                </div>
