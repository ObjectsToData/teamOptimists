                    <p>When the jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton died penniless and alone nearly 60 years ago, his reputation was already fading. New musical styles had displaced the hot jazz he helped invent, and a younger generation of players disdained him.</p><p>Today, however, Morton is resurgent. New books and recordings, together with changing attitudes among scholars, musicians and listeners, are placing him back at the peak of the jazz pantheon.</p><p>Part of Morton's appeal, and part of what led musicians in Northern cities like New York to scorn him in the 1930's, was his picaresque and almost unimaginably arrogant style. He wore flashy suits, sported a diamond implanted in one of his front teeth and often told players who were not from New Orleans that their music was pitifully inadequate.</p><p>For many years Morton lived the sporting life. He was a larger-than-life figure who made money not just at the piano but as a gambler, pimp, card sharp and pool hustler. Northern musicians like Duke Ellington, including those who emerged from big bands to develop the modern bebop style, dismissed him as a braggart who had failed to keep up with the times and was never as great as he imagined.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''In the 1940's there was a great schism in the jazz world,'' said Robert Koester, owner of the Chicago-based Delmark recording company. ''It was the greatest schism since Constantinople. Bebop was triumphant, and the party line was that everything before bebop was junk. The jazz press ignored everything that came before Charlie Parker. That approach lasted for quite a while, but more recently people's minds have broadened quite a bit. One result of that is that Jelly is finally being recognized as a great jazz composer, a great pianist and even a great singer.''</p><p>The revival of Morton's reputation grew steadily through the 1990's. Some jazz fans disliked the musical ''Jelly's Last Jam'' by George C. Wolfe because, they said, it unfairly portrayed Morton as a racist who denied his black roots and scorned Louis Armstrong. Still, it brought Morton's name and musical style to a new audience, especially in a 1992 Broadway production starring Gregory Hines.</p><p>A more authentic tribute to Morton was the two-day celebration of his life and work that was part of the recent Chicago Humanities Festival. At one concert, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble played several of Morton's works that were recently found in a jazz archive after being lost for decades.</p><p>As the ensemble played, its founder and music director, William Russo, felt a complex mix of emotions.</p><p>''At the simplest level, it was a Tolstoyan delight just to hear this beautiful music wafting through the air,'' Mr. Russo said afterward. ''On a professional level, it was amazing to me to hear the quality of this music. Jelly Roll wrote it at the end of his life, and at that moment I was imagining all he would have accomplished if only he'd been able to carry on a little longer. So it was joy mixed with sadness.'' Jazz figures like Mr. Russo, who grew up in the 1950's, were entranced by musical innovators like Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie who scorned the New Orleans tradition that Morton embodied.</p><p>''The fact that it had been taken over by white boys in straw hats and was advertised as 'Dixieland' sent shivers down our spines, because that was considered racist by many of us,'' Mr. Russo recalled. ''Now I see that this is music that gets to you like Shakespeare or Charlie Chaplin, music that is joyous and affirmative but also has real profundity and complexity. Today I would definitely put Morton in the top five of jazz along with Ellington, Louis Armstrong and a couple of others.''</p><p>After the ensemble played a newfound piece called ''Gan-Jam,'' Howard Reich, a jazz critic who participated in the Chicago tribute, said that toward the end of his life, Morton ''wrote things out as meticulously as Strauss or Beethoven.''</p><p>''This is writing that's unbelievably sophisticated,'' Mr. Reich said. ''I don't think anyone would ever identify it as by Jelly Roll Morton. It's like a tone poem, written in classical sonata form. It's just an astonishing piece of music.''</p><p>Morton enjoyed precisely that kind of acclaim early in his career. Born Ferdinand Lamothe (not Lamenthe or La Menthe, as some earlier researchers believed) into a New Orleans Creole family in 1890, he grew up in a formal musical environment shaped by players at the city's symphony orchestras and opera companies.</p><p>By the time he reached his teens, Morton had found his way to Storyville, the city's red-light district, where ragtime musicians played in luxurious brothels, and jazz was beginning to take shape. Whether he actually invented jazz, as he often claimed, is and will always be debatable. Beyond much doubt, however, he was the first serious jazz composer, the first to write multithemed pieces and develop a distinctive jazz style.</p><p>Many other musicians who worked in New Orleans around this period also enjoyed great success, among them Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Buddy Bolden, Joe (King) Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Kid Ory and Tony Jackson, who was the only pianist Morton ever considered his equal or better. Lovers of traditional jazz still revere them all, but only Armstrong and perhaps Morton have risen to the level of musical sainthood.</p>                </div>
