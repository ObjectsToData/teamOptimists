That was my first thought as a returning graduate when, surrounded by light-blue balloons, I passed through the tall iron gates at 116th Street and Broadway on a sunny late-August morning to join the Columbia College Class of 2004 for the first day of new-student orientation.    Almost 40 years earlier, on a rainy mid-September Sunday in 1960 (the academic year began later then), I had walked through those same gates to take part in freshman orientation as a member of the Class of 1964.

Almost 40 years earlier, on a rainy mid-September Sunday in 1960 (the academic year began later then), I had walked through those same gates to take part in freshman orientation as a member of the Class of 1964.

                    <p>Now I was going back to see how things had changed. So much had -- on and off the campus. Computers, the Internet, women's rights, civil rights, Vietnam, student demon-strations, the sexual revolution -- they had all been in the future.</p><p>Now, the cold war, the Communist menace, the military draft, the ever-present concern that the world will end, not with a whimper but a bang, are all in the past. We are, as everyone knows, in the midst of the longest and largest period of prosperity this country has ever known. Today's dress code is shorts or jeans, T-shirts and sneakers, not ties and jackets. And no beanies.</p><p>The beanies, light blue with a white ''64'' on the front, had been conceived years earlier as a mark of inferiority but in 1960 had been ''magically transformed'' by the freshmen, according to the school newspaper, The Columbia Daily Spectator, into a symbol of community. The beanies were eliminated sometime around the late 1980's (no one was sure precisely when) but that theme of community had, 40 years later, become pervasive.</p><p>The first new students I met this August were Sabreena Karim of Teaneck, N.J., and Manuel Santini of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Neither would have been a likely member of the Class of 1960.</p><p>My class had 725 students, all male and overwhelmingly white (Columbia College did not become coeducational until 1983). Thirty-three states and 10 foreign countries were represented, but all but 190 came from within a 50-mile radius of New York City. College Board averages were 657 for verbal and 673 for math -- the highest in the history of the Ivy League college. Eighty percent of the students had been in the top fifth of their class, 61 percent in the top tenth.</p><p>The 1,013 members of the Class of 2004 were selected from 13,464 applicants, the most Columbia has ever had. There are 509 men, 504 women. All 50 states and 36 countries are represented. The mean College Board scores are 702.3 for verbal, 697.1 for math. Seventy-nine percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school class, 91 percent were in the top 20 percent.</p><p>The class is a rainbow of diversity, with significant numbers of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. Diversity is a prime Columbia goal, and it is achieved.</p><p>Orientation 1960 lasted three days, and while students were introduced to extracurricular activities, the focus was on the academic -- planning programs and meeting with advisers. ''Guidance and help are available,'' the college's dean, John G. Palfrey, wrote in a message to the new class, ''but there is an assumption of maturity.''</p><p>On Sept. 19, 1960, The Spectator announced that for the first time at orientation there would be an additional emphasis on ''Columbia as a part of New York City,'' including a ''Meet New York Program'' of 11 special tours, sponsored by the campus's Citizenship Council to encourage student volunteer work. They included Democratic and Republican campaign headquarters (for John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon), the Cloisters, the United States Court House at Foley Square and the Manhattan House of Detention for Men.</p><p>Orientation 2000 lasted a week, with many additional activities scheduled during the fall semester. Scores of student, faculty and administration volunteers spent the summer planning and preparing. While, as in 1960, there was an assumption of maturity, there was also a tacit acknowledgment that we live in a complex world, and it is all right to seek help.</p><p>In addition to program advising and an academic resources fair, to computer training and an introduction to the library, to dances and parties and extracurricular activities, there were cruises on the Hudson River with music; a togetherness rally on South Lawn; a workshop on how to live with a roommate; get-togethers for Asian-Pacific students, African-American students, gay and lesbian students, Jewish students, and a community meeting on diversity in the school's Levien Gym that packed in all the new students from the college, Barnard and the campus's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.</p><p>Tours took students not to the Manhattan House of Detention for Men but to almost every neighborhood in Manhattan, from SoHo and Chelsea to Harlem; to a Puerto Rican poetry center; and to Lucky Cheng's, a restaurant on the Lower East Side with transvestite waiters.</p><p>Togetherness was everywhere. ''Try to build community,'' the college's dean, Austin Quigley, told the students Wednesday morning, at the first formal academic meeting.</p>                </div>
