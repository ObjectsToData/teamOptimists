As a child I spent hours each evening comparing notes with friends and exchanging ideas on different topics. We had encyclopedias and textbooks as guides, and if we were lucky, we also had help from our parents. But the biggest resource we had was one another.     Today's students still rely on one another for homework help, but now they communicate in chat rooms and are able to go onto the huge information superhighway without interrupting their online conversation. And for many students, the library encyclopedia has been replaced by search engines like Yahooligans and Searchopolis. And there are now many sites on the Net designed specifically to aid students with their homework assignments. Some rely on experts who respond by e-mail or chat with students. Others work as Web site clearinghouses by providing links to child-friendly educational sites on different subject areas.  ">

But the biggest resource we had was one another.</p><p>Today's students still rely on one another for homework help, but now they communicate in chat rooms and are able to go onto the huge information superhighway without interrupting their online conversation. And for many students, the library encyclopedia has been replaced by search engines like Yahooligans and Searchopolis. And there are now many sites on the Net designed specifically to aid students with their homework assignments. Some rely on experts who respond by e-mail or chat with students. Others work as Web site clearinghouses by providing links to child-friendly educational sites on different subject areas.</p><p>As an experiment, I recently collected a week's worth of assignments for fifth graders at my school. I brought textbooks home to complete the assignments but primarily relied on the Internet and the various homework help sites to answer my questions. I tried to balance the lofty goal of learning as much as possible through each assignment with the all-too-common tendency to get the answers as quickly and easily as possible.  As my mother says, done is beautiful.</p><p>What I found was that homework sites are frequently trustworthy and accurate and  that some provide amazingly speedy responses. They are a convenient way to get answers within a couple of days, but if you are working on a tighter deadline, you must find a live tutoring site. I also found that it is easy to get almost too much help -- good news for the student who needs a quick fix and potentially bad news for teachers and parents. Any site that provides an e-mail exchange with teachers, or an online chat room with subject area experts, gives a child the opportunity to ask a question and get the correct answer before trying to answer it without assistance. The online experts cannot determine who needs the help and who just wants a shortcut.</p>                </div>

                    <p>AMERICA ONLINE HOMEWORK HELPER</p><p>I have never been a fan of AOL -- I find it an unnecessary shortcut for students who should be learning to manage information on the Web. But last year when I asked a room of 80 fifth graders whether any of them used AOL, roughly 90 percent of the students raised their hands, so I thought its homework area deserved a look.</p><p>AOL's Homework Helper section of its Kids Only channel proved to be a pleasant surprise. It has 1,700 volunteer teachers and tutors and more than 100 peer tutors. Most of the tutors are certified teachers who volunteer from their homes in the evenings.  Peer tutors are students between the ages of 16 and 18, many of whom receive high school service-hour credits for their work with AOL. Although that is not clearly explained on the site, tutors can be identified throughout the site by the user-name prefixes AAC for the teachers and HHPT for the peer tutors. The only problem is figuring out where exactly to go for help.</p><p>The AOL site features elements common to most of the help sites I visited: a Web search engine and an encyclopedia. I also found a useful online dictionary and thesaurus on the site. Each major curriculum area has a link that leads to activities loosely based on the subject. For example, clicking on the Social Studies link calls up geography games, maps and a safari game. The activities vary in actual educational value. The two most prominent sections of the site are the Ask a Teacher message board and the tutoring rooms. AOL says the site helps an average of 4,000 students in the tutoring rooms each week and answers 2,500 questions through the message board.</p><p>Ask a Teacher was somewhat confusing at first, but once I got used to its clumsy navigation, it proved to be extremely useful. You choose a subject, then a curriculum area and grade level. You then post your question. A teacher will post an answer or reply on the message board within 48 hours.  That works, but searching to find your answer can be difficult. On a Friday night I posted a science question on the fifth- to sixth-grade Science area. I went back to the site on the following Sunday and searched but couldn't find my question. I then went through the listings one at a time and found my question with two responses attached.</p><p>While the answers were right, they seemed to have been answered by another user or student. Students must determine for themselves whether the answers are trustworthy. That may involve finding answers on their own, which defeats the purpose of using a shortcut, and there are often hundreds of messages to scroll through.</p><p>The AOL Tutoring Room is what truly sets this Web resource apart from most other homework helper sites. The area is an organized chat room that allows students to talk one-on-one with online tutors. The room is open most weeknights and at certain times during the weekend. The students log in and are immediately asked for their grade levels and questions. The questions must be related to the subject area of the chat room, and no off-topic chat is allowed. I observed some users being suspended for inappropriate behavior and others receiving warnings because they were not sticking to the topic. I even reported some suspicious behavior myself.</p>                </div>
