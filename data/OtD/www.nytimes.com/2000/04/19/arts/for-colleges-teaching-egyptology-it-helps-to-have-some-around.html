    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="THERE is only so much that Victoria Russell, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of Memphis's Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology can learn from books. And there is only so much that members of the art club at Liberty High School in Mountain View, Mo., can learn in classrooms.    So on a recent afternoon, students in the Liberty High art club took a 180-mile field trip to Memphis, where they met Ms. Russell, who guided them through the university art gallery's Egyptian collection. Pointing to a sculpture of a man and a woman, she explained that people were often presented in idealized form in Egyptian art. That, she said, is why ''all the guys are buff and cut, and all the girls are slim and trim.''  ">

And there is only so much that members of the art club at Liberty High School in Mountain View, Mo., can learn in classrooms.</p><p>So on a recent afternoon, students in the Liberty High art club took a 180-mile field trip to Memphis, where they met Ms. Russell, who guided them through the university art gallery's Egyptian collection. Pointing to a sculpture of a man and a woman, she explained that people were often presented in idealized form in Egyptian art. That, she said, is why ''all the guys are buff and cut, and all the girls are slim and trim.''</p><p>Looking at and hearing about works created more than four millenniums ago helps to broaden the teenagers' view of the possibilities of art by connecting them with its ancient practices. Conducting tours, Ms. Russell said, reinforces her academic studies and gives her the hands-on experience she can use in a career in art and museums. ''Talking to different groups,'' she said, ''helps you understand how to relate this interesting stuff that you have learned in your studies to a more general audience, to someone who doesn't know the minutiae.''</p><p>While many museums are focused on research, preservation, display and sometimes educational outreach, college and university museums have an additional mandate -- training and developing young scholars like Ms. Russell. They fulfill that mission not only for those whose studies directly relate to the objects on display, but also for the student body. ''The museum is an absolutely essential element of our curriculum,'' said Richard Ranta, the dean of the College of Communications and Fine Arts at the University of Memphis. ''It is a place where art and artifacts are seen, examined and appreciated. Not having a museum as part of a humanities curriculum would be like teaching chemistry and biology strictly from books and having no lab experience.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The University of Memphis has one of the leading Egyptian collections among college and university galleries in the United States. It began in 1975 when a Memphis businessman, noting that his city was named after the somewhat older on in Egypt, provided a grant to buy 44 Egyptian objects from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1984, the institute was formed, and in 1993 it began offering a master's degree in Egyptian art and archaeology. The two-year program culminates in an art history degree that encompasses ancient Egyptian language and culture. Now the university's collection has grown to include objects on loan from other distinguished institutions like the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>Lorelei Corcoran, the institute's director, said she was drawn to it partly because she would have the opportunity to work in a museum and teach. The experience has been a lesson to her and her students, she said, recalling a class in which they examined a ceramic New Year's jar -- dating to about 900 B.C. -- from the collection.</p><p>''When you look at it,'' she said, ''it appears to be very dense and heavy, but when you hold it you see that it is light, like holding a balloon. And it is the fragile qualities of the object that make it so rare.</p><p>''Our students have held it and experienced the amazement at how it survived thousands of years, being so fragile. That is the kind of thing you can't convey with slides and books and works on the Internet.''</p><p>The Association of College and University Museums and Galleries lists at least 1,000 college and university museums in its nationwide database. Unlike many of their nonacademic counterparts, most of them charge no admission, which makes their collections very accessible to the public. Faculty members from disciplines other than art also feel free to use campus museums as teaching tools. ''We are able to reach student audiences who may never come to a museum on their own,'' said M. Akua McDaniel, the director of the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art in Atlanta.</p><p>The Spelman Museum, created in 1996 as part of a humanities building, was built with a donation from Bill and Camille Cosby. The university had a collection of paintings, prints, photographs, sculptures and textiles, but nowhere to display it. The new museum has 4,500 square feet of gallery space, a gift shop, storage and conservation laboratory.</p><p>''The experiences we provide these young women here at Spelman,'' Ms. McDaniel said, ''can prepare them to be good consumers and supporters of the arts. We also are preparing some to enter the museum world, where the part of the pool that employs diverse women is shallow.''</p><p>An academic affiliation has its drawbacks: more bureaucracy to penetrate when seeking project approval, a need to function in a system of departments and institutes and programming that must balance giving students and faculty members a forum for their works with bringing in objects and exhibitions from beyond campus.</p><p>But a home on campus has advantages, too, as administrators of the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History at the University of Oklahoma have discovered. In May, the university will open a new 195,000-square-foot, $37.5 million museum, which was built with money from state, local and private sources.</p><p>Being based at a university meant there was access to expertise in planning and development that nonuniversity institutions must bring in or contract out, said Peter Tirrell, the associate director, who is also a former president of the Association of College and University Museums and Galleries. University computer, publicity and business departments, for example, were able to help the new museum with business and marketing plans, fund-raising and technical advice.</p><p>And the museum will provide pleasant space on campus for other university fund-raising and recruiting efforts. ''Just as we bring potential donors and faculty to football games when they are visiting the campus,'' Mr. Tirrell said, ''now we will also bring them to our state-of-the-art museum.''</p><p>A museum or gallery can also draw students. For example, most sixth graders in the Memphis area tour the Egyptian exhibition because it is the state's curriculum to study Egypt in sixth grade. Those students might enroll here in a few years.</p><p>And museums often enhance a university's prestige, by the quality of their collections and by lending their works to other exhibitions that travel and spread the university's name. Since its founding in 1887, for example, the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology has built a renowned collection of almost one million artifacts, most of them culled from the more than 350 expeditions it has sponsored all over the world. This month the museum is breaking ground for a $17 million wing for storage and research.</p><p>''Just as you may have a Nobel Prize-winning scientist on campus,'' Mr. Ranta, the dean at the University of Memphis, said, ''the museum adds an aura to the institution. Museums, like libraries, can carry on the historical tradition of universities, to preserve knowledge through the ages.''</p><p>Photos: Dr. Lorelei Corcoran, the director of the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology at the University of Memphis, with the coffin lid for the mummy Iret-Irew, which dates to about 300 B.C.
