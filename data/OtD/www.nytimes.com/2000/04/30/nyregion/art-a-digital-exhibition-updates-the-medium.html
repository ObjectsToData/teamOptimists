The contribution is usually tacit, and many non-artists have the same sophisticated image-making programs in their PC's, that the artists do. Computer art, therefore, is coming to be regarded as a mode of art-making like any other.    So it is something of an occasion when an exhibition comes along that allows us to check the progress of the medium. At the University of Bridgeport, ''Digital Smart'' is in the form of a juried competition plus a couple of ''invited guests.'' The organizer, Sean Nixon of the university's Integrated Art Department, says in his preface to the illustrated brochure, that digital art has come into its own. And later, that the works in the show are ''surprisingly reminiscent of traditional fine art.''  ">

The contribution is usually tacit, and many non-artists have the same sophisticated image-making programs in their PC's, that the artists do. Computer art, therefore, is coming to be regarded as a mode of art-making like any other.</p><p>So it is something of an occasion when an exhibition comes along that allows us to check the progress of the medium. At the University of Bridgeport, ''Digital Smart'' is in the form of a juried competition plus a couple of ''invited guests.'' The organizer, Sean Nixon of the university's Integrated Art Department, says in his preface to the illustrated brochure, that digital art has come into its own. And later, that the works in the show are ''surprisingly reminiscent of traditional fine art.''</p><p>This statement gives pause. The upshot might be that it's now possible to make more art, and make it faster. But there's already too much art out there, too much stored unsold in artists' studios, that this aspect of the digital revolution seems a dubious gain. And the thought might cross one's mind that the software will come to be relied on too much. The adage used to be that art is 10 percent inspiration and 90 percent perspiration. Both these factors are in danger of evaporating.</p><p>But rather than speculate fretfully, it's always best to look at the actual work. The jury -- Pattie-Belle Hastings, an artist; Ben Ortiz, curator at the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport; and Bruce Wands, chairman of the M.F.A. Computer Department at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan -- chose a wide range of work, most of it abstract.</p>                </div>

                    <p>For their part the chosen artists have largely avoided the posturing, and exaggerated or sentimental claims that usually characterize an artist's statement. In the catalog, the artists give technical or process pointers, which seems fitting for an early gathering of digital art.</p><p>Some of the most interesting pieces are by Robert Jackson. They are in the realm of organic abstraction, and resemble the insides of flowers made famous by Georgia O'Keeffe. But they have added luster, which can be credited to enamel paints and Halogen lighting.</p><p>Kenneth Huff creates more explicit flowers, small ones appearing in decorative clusters across horizontal formats. His method, though, is not for everybody, for his images were created entirely in Alias/Wavefront Maya, ''a high end three-dimensional modeling, animating and rendering software application.''</p><p>Jim Cogswell's works are humorous charcoal drawings -- the image of an artist drawing can be discerned in the largely abstract composition -- and look like that commonplace medium, even though ''the drawing is built in Adobe Illustrator.''</p><p>Denis Sargent uses an ink jet printer to print on unbleached muslin and includes a tantalizing statement regrettably without elaboration, ''My present work is inspired by the so-called 'war rugs' that have been woven by Afghan refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.'' Deena des Rioux is one of the invited artists, and her aim is to ''effect a symbiosis between human and high-tech components.'' In her work, stylized human shapes are animated by their technological surroundings.</p><p>A little humor is welcome. S. A. Ramsey elaborates, straight-faced, in great technical detail about how the three-dimensionality is achieved. Nothing is said about the overriding whimsy in ''Rabbit Round-Up,'' ''Spacewalk,'' or ''Blue Shadows.'' The latter two feature an especially expressive crescent moon. Chris Johnson, whose main character is a lifeguard, enlightens us as a stand-up comic might do. ''Most lifeguards are 16 or 17, not allowed to vote but given the responsibility of saving lives.''</p><p>The university's Arts and Humanities building has an elliptical bulge attached to it. It's called the Bubble and its original use was as a theater in-the-round. It has gone a bit to seed, but now functions as an appropriate darkened space, in which the kinetic, or moving, computer-assisted works are shown. Some of them are in the form of lightboxes that read like framed pictures, but with more depth; others are videotapes. All the works show technical mastery, but few are genuinely compelling. Instead they are often wearyingly reminiscent of psychedelia.</p><p>But the piece de resistance of the exhibition is in the Bubble, also, and it threatens to be the biggest thing on campus for the duration of the show. ''MetaField Maze'' by Ron McNeil, the other of the invited artists, looks at first like a rug projected on the floor. A closer look reveals that it's a traditional maze, and the objective is to get the computer-generated ball home without its falling into one of the computer-generated holes. The players stand on the maze and their movements direct the action. It's not easy. An added complication is that the field is tipsy, like a subway car.</p><p>Sharing the gallery with ''Digital Smart'' is another demonstration of a rather new medium that isn't as novel as it used to be: the large format Polaroid print. But Joachim Knill's ripe humor is his own; the Swiss artists uses the familiar process of constructing tableaus and then photographing them to look as if they are real-life events.</p><p>The process plays on the commonly held notion that anything in a photograph is taken as the truth. If that were so, pumpkins would land like flying saucers disturbing the ground cover of fallen leaves.</p><p>''Digital Smart'' and Joachim Knill's ''Fantastic Journey'' is at the University Gallery of the University of Bridgeport through May 13.</p><p>Photos: Left, clockwise from top left, from ''Digital Smart'': Deena des Rioux's ''Inductors,''S.
