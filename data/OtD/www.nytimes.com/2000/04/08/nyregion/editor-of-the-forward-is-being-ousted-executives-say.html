With the paper's staff pleading for their boss's job and prominent Jewish figures lamenting his dismissal as a major loss to Jewish journalism, Mr. Lipsky is being forced out by some owners of The Forward who regard him as too right-wing for the paper's socialist traditions, said editors and executives.

                    <p>Mr. Lipsky, 53, a former senior editor at The Wall Street Journal, created The Forward in 1990 to revive the crusading journalistic traditions of The Jewish Daily Forward, a paper that was founded in 1897 and helped define Jewish-American life for millions of Yiddish-speaking immigrants.</p><p>At its peak in the 1920's, after the great rush of immigration from Eastern Europe, circulation exceeded 250,000. The paper, known today as The Yiddish Forward, is a sister publication of The Forward and still exists as a weekly, but has a small and dwindling circulation in a dying language among an aging readership.</p><p>What seems to have cost Mr. Lipsky his job was a dispute about The Forward's journalistic traditions and how the paper could best serve readers who do not speak  Yiddish but remain intensely interested in their Jewish identity and in the fate of Israel.</p><p>Mr. Lipsky, who describes himself as neo-conservative, said that The Forward's tradition demanded freewheeling editorial independence, with none of the kid-glove treatment other Jewish newspapers gave to wealthy Jewish organizations. An early front-page article listed the salaries of presidents of leading Jewish groups.</p><p>Mr. Lipsky also wrote editorials that chided readers for their liberal assumptions about such matters as America's involvement in Vietnam. He raised eyebrows by praising Ronald Reagan as a rare politician with the guts to describe Vietnam as a ''noble'' cause.</p><p>In a piece three years ago in Commentary that aggressively defended his editorial values, Mr. Lipsky accused his critics of having a ''selective memory'' and of ignoring what The Daily Forward really stood for when it was the conscience of American Judaism.</p><p>''Every time I have dipped into the files of The Forward, I have found editorials on Zionism and Israel rippling with verve and strength and hewing to what, in the contemporary context, can only be called a hard line,'' he wrote.</p><p>While saying that Mr. Lipsky had a right to his views, many prominent Jewish figures, including some who had been skewered in the paper, argued that he had no right to publish those views in The Forward.</p><p>Executives at the paper said the dispute had very little to do with money, although the weekly, with a circulation of 26,000, loses about $2 million a year.</p><p>But half the money that keeps the weekly newspaper afloat comes from The Forward Association, which, members say, made its money by serving the interests of the Jewish labor movement.</p><p>''This money accumulated because of Yiddish-reading Jews in the heyday of The Daily Forward and they were social democrats,'' said Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a longtime critic of Mr. Lipsky, past president of the American Jewish Congress and the Bronfman visiting professor of the humanities at New York University.</p><p>''We are staunchly for the welfare state,'' Rabbi Hertzberg added. ''Lipsky is not staunchly for the welfare state, and he should be if he wants to edit this newspaper.''</p><p>Under the partnership contract that dictates how The Forward is managed, half the paper's money comes from Lipsky-Steinhardt L.L.C., a group whose major investor is Michael Steinhardt, a former hedge-fund manager and philanthropist who has invested $5 million in the weekly.</p><p>Mr. Steinhardt wanted Mr. Lipsky to stay as editor and offered to take over The Forward, said editors at the paper. But the ownership contract prohibits new investment without the consent of both partners, these editors said. The Forward Association gave Mr. Steinhardt the choice of either closing the paper or accepting a new editor.</p><p>This has outraged the weekly's 25-member staff, which last month sent a letter to the directors of the newspaper urging them not to dismiss Mr. Lipsky.</p><p>''We plead with you not to destroy what you have helped create,'' the letter said. ''We believe that it would be a serious error to force him out; we think that doing so would harm The Forward's quality and its reputation for independence.''</p><p>Another letter to the company's directors from eight former writers and editors at the paper said, ''If Seth were to be forced out, The Forward as we know it will cease to exist.''</p><p>The signatories, all of whom are listed on the paper's masthead as contributing editors, wrote that if Mr. Lipsky is ousted, they would demand that their names be removed.</p><p>''This is a sickening development,'' said Jeffrey Goldberg, a former reporter at The Forward who signed the letter and who is now a contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine. ''We believe that this is basically destroying the only independent news organization in America covering the Jewish community.''</p><p>While The Forward is read by a relative handful of people, its supporters and its critics maintain that they include the most influential Jews in the United States.</p><p>''The old joke was we have three readers,'' said Mr. Goldberg, ''but they are the right readers.''</p><p>Photos: Seth Lipsky is being forced out as editor of The Forward by owners who regard him as too conservative, editors and executives said.  </p>                </div>
