She died in September of that year at 50, leaving behind the unfinished manuscript. Since the early 1970's the autobiography has been with McCullers's other papers at the University of Texas's Harry Ransom Humanities Center in Austin.    That manuscript, ''Illumination and Night Glare: the Unfinished Autobiography of Carson McCullers,'' was published late last year.

                    <p>In 1967, paralyzed by a stroke, Carson McCullers began dictating her autobiography to several friends and assistants. She died in September of that year at 50, leaving behind the unfinished manuscript. Since the early 1970's the autobiography has been with McCullers's other papers at the University of Texas's Harry Ransom Humanities Center in Austin.</p><p>That manuscript, ''Illumination and Night Glare: the Unfinished Autobiography of Carson McCullers,'' was published late last year. Although it is brief and highly selective, marked by its omissions as well as its inclusions, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the creative struggles of the author.</p><p>In the book, edited by Carlos L. Dews, McCullers starts on a poignant note: ''My life has been almost completely filled with work and love, thank goodness. Work has not always been easy, nor has love, may I add.''</p><p>She explains that it was when she was ''un-illuminated'' and facing a ''night glare'' that she feared she would never write again. ''This fear,'' she says, ''is one of the horrors of an author's life.'' Then she wonders: ''Where does work come from? What chance, what small episode will start the chain of creation?''</p>                </div>

                    <p>For her, some episodes were so small as to be totally inapparent to others. ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,'' her Southern Gothic novella about the romance between an Amazonian woman and a dwarf, had its origins in a bar in Brooklyn. One day McCullers was sitting in the bar with W. H. Auden and the editor George Davis, housemates of hers at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights, and she ''saw and was fascinated by a remarkable couple . . . a woman who was tall and strong as a giantess, and at her heels she had a little hunchback.''</p><p>''I just observed them once,'' she wrote in the autobiography, ''and it was not until some weeks later that the illumination of 'The Ballad of the Sad Cafe' struck me.'' She was writing the novel ''The Member of the Wedding'' when ''with a sudden voltage I remembered the hunchback and giantess.'' She suspended work on the novel to write the shorter fiction.</p><p>McCullers's story is one of phenomenal early success and crippling illnesses and emotional disabilities. In 1940, when she was 23, she published her first novel, ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,'' a major literary success. Her second novel, ''Reflections in a Golden Eye,'' followed within a year.</p><p>The publication of the autobiography (by the University of Wisconsin Press) coincides with a revival of interest in McCullers's work. Houghton Mifflin, her longtime publisher, has reprinted two volumes in paperback: her last novel, ''Clock Without Hands,'' and ''Collected Stories,'' which includes ''The Member of the Wedding,'' ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe'' and other stories. This fall the company is scheduled to publish an English translation of Josyane Savigneau's ''Carson McCullers: A Life,'' previously available in France.</p><p>In the late 1980's Mr. Dews, an associate professor of English at the University of West Florida, decided that the autobiography, albeit incomplete, had literary value. He used it as the basis for his doctoral thesis, but, he said recently, ''it took close to 10 years to convince the estate to publish it.''</p><p>The book has divided critics, with those who favor it being the ones who most admire McCullers's work. A reviewer in The New Criterion said that ''Illumination and Night Glare'' served no purpose and ''tells us nothing new about this most bizarre of characters.'' In contrast, The London Times Literary Supplement said it was ''a rich mine of information for anyone interested in McCullers and American literary life in the 1950's.''</p><p>Mr. Dews believes that, because of McCullers's complex life, the book could serve ''as an inspirational and cautionary tale for future generations, as she intended.'' Virginia Spencer Carr, author of ''The Lonely Hunter: A Biography of Carson McCullers,'' agreed, saying that, in contrast to other writers who left unfinished work, McCullers ''fully intended it to be published.''</p><p>The book is less an autobiography than a scrapbook of diverse memories. In barely 70 pages of text, the author offers insights into her method of creativity (and her periods of noncreativity) and describes how deeply affected she was by reading Proust and other writers. Occasionally she offers insights into her private life as well, although, as Mr. Dews points out, she ''does not discuss her bisexuality or lesbianism directly.''</p><p>In one passage, she writes about the ''magnificent'' summer of 1946, when she and Tennessee Williams shared a house on Nantucket and worked every morning at the same table. He was writing ''Summer and Smoke,'' and she was dramatizing ''The Member of the Wedding,'' which had been published that year as a novel. After swimming ''in the late sea-lulling afternoon,'' she would play the piano or Williams would read aloud from Hart Crane.</p><p>On the opposite page of her memory book, she recalls that ''in the middle of these years of fury and disaster,'' her father suddenly died of a coronary thrombosis, and ''a grotesque and horrible thing'' happened at his funeral. It was, she said, like something out of Flannery O'Connor. Through a mixup, the minister read ''The Psalm of the Sinners'' instead of, as requested, ''The Lord Is My Shepherd.''</p>                </div>
