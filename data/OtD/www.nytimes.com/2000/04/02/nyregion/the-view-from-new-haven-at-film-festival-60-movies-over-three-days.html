                    <p>If you are Film Fest New Haven, you stick with your strengths. ''We've always had a threefold mission,'' said Ms. Adams. ''To educate the audience about independent filmmaking, to screen only the highest quality independent films, and to provide a friendly and supportive environment for filmmakers. Each year, we've simply expanded on those goals.''</p><p>In 1996, the first Film Fest New Haven presented 28 films -- 9 features and 19 shorts -- for a total of 12 hours of programming. This year more than 60 films will be shown, enough to keep three sites (York Square Cinemas, the Whitney Humanities Center and the Little Theatre) running continuously.</p><p>At Film Fest New Haven, short films are often bundled into 90-minute to two-hour blocks -- or paired off with features -- that share a similar theme. One of this weekend's primary themes will be passion. Films that express a passion for cultural roots, or work, or sport, or music and art, will be packaged together. Ms. Adams said this system has proven to be a powerful way to present shorts, which get little commercial exposure and yet are important calling cards for young filmmakers.</p><p>Family films also receive special attention. ''If you can't engage young people in independent film, who's going to be your audience 10 to 15 years from now?'' Ms. Adams said.</p><p>She's especially excited about the screening of ''Kusah Hakwaan,'' an independent feature from Alaska, filmed in the native Tlingit language. ''It centers around the classic folk tale of the raven and the cannibal,'' Ms. Adams said. ''The film is of great interest to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, who are working with us on a family event that will be part of the film program.''</p><p>Documentaries have always been part of the Film Fest New Haven schedule, and this year they are prominent. Friday night's  showcase is ''Shadow Boxers,'' directed and produced by Katya Bankowsky, an alumna of Yale University. It chronicles the 1995 Golden Gloves boxing competition, the first in which women were allowed to compete, and the pursuit of the world championship of Lucia Rijker of The Netherlands. ''The film reflects my ambivalence about boxing,'' Ms. Bankowsky said. ''It's a brutally damaging, dangerous sport, but it's also  beautiful, graceful and elegant.''</p><p>St. Clair Bourne of Guilford will be the recipient of Film Fest New Haven's annual Connecticut Filmmaker Award. During the weekend, Mr. Bourne will preside over screenings of his films, ''Paul Robeson: Here I Stand'' (originally created for PBS's ''American Masters'' series) and ''John Henrik Clarke: A Great and Mighty Walk.''</p><p>''To be honest, I feel Connecticut is the one place where people know me least,'' Mr. Bourne said. ''I do my work elsewhere; this is my resting place.''</p><p>Mr. Bourne, who is black, admitted that he has found film festivals he has attended ''disturbingly white in orientation. Film Fest New Haven has promised me they will do community outreach by busing in black high school kids to a special Friday morning screening of 'Clarke.' '' This plan, Ms. Adams said, will be carried out with the collaboration of New Haven's Coalition of 100 Black Women and the Sankofa Cultural Arts Festival, which runs Wednesday through April 15.</p><p>Close to 10 percent of the roughly 400 film submissions Film Fest New Haven received for consideration this year came from Connecticut natives, many of whom have since moved to New York City or Los Angeles.</p><p>''A lot of my friends still live in New Haven,'' said Gail Lerner, who was born in Woodbridge. Her first film, ''Seraglio,'' a romantic mystery created in collaboration with her husband, Colin Campbell, is at York Square Cinemas on Saturday.</p><p>''I'm excited that they'll get to see it,'' she said. ''And I feel like I learned my love of movies at York Square, so to go back and see my own film there is pretty thrilling.''</p><p>Other films by Connecticut natives are:</p><p>*''My Father's Story,'' by Mary Kocol, a Wethersfield native, documents Romuald Kocol's experiences as a non-Jewish Polish man incarcerated in a Nazi labor camp during World War II and his subsequent emigration to the United States. ''The film has a 'family photo album' kind of structure,'' Ms. Kocol said.</p><p>*''Das Clown,'' a tale about a murderous clown doll by the Stamford native Tom E. Brown, is being billed as an AIDS allegory and a comedy.</p><p>*''The Night Ferris Bueller Died'' by Dan Settani, who grew up in Middlebury, is about a confrontation between a late-night New York City subway rider and a delusional homeless man who mistakes him for the actor Matthew Broderick. It is filmed almost entirely at East Haven's Shoreline Trolley Museum.</p><p>*''Captive Audience,'' co-created by the Harwinton native Mike Gioscia, is about the conflict at a radio station between the overnight D.J. Jack the Ripper and Howard, a listener who takes him hostage.</p><p>Greg Pak, a filmmaker and another Yale alumnus, said he loves to attend the festival. This year he will represent ''Avenue of the Asian Americans,'' an anthology of 10 three-minute films created by New York City's Asian American Filmmakers Collaborative.</p><p>The festival has spotlighted its share of stars and stars-in-the-making. In 1998, Charles Dutton (of ''Cookie's Fortune'' and ''A Time to Kill'') attended in support of his directorial debut, ''First-Time Felon.'' That was the same year that the director and Madison native Brad Anderson was honored  with a Connecticut Filmmaker Award, just ahead of the commercial release of his breakthrough film, ''Next Stop Wonderland,'' while Keiko Ibi screened her movie ''The Personals,'' which went on to win the 1999 Oscar for best short documentary.</p><p>''We think of that,'' Ms. Adams said, ''as merely the festival's first Academy Award-winning film.''</p><p>The opening ceremonies for the fifth annual Film Fest New Haven begin at 7 p.m. on Friday at the York Square Cinemas.
