                    <p>Yale University Press. $35.</p><p>When, in 1506, diggers' shovels hit a large piece of ancient sculpture in Rome's Esquiline Hill, news of the event was sent urgently to Pope Julius II, who dispatched the Vatican architect, Giuliano da Sangallo, to oversee the precious work's safe extraction. Sangallo's son was with him (we have the account from him), and so was a young colleague, Michelangelo Buonarotti. The son jumped down into the pit, while his father, standing over it, excitedly proclaimed, ''That is the LaocoRated PG-13n, which Pliny mentions.'' When the sculptural group was carefully swung up to the surface, says the son, ''everyone started to draw.'' The find would be broadcast throughout Europe by the Renaissance equivalent of photojournalists. Soon kings and nobles would be asking the pope for copies of the famous episode from Virgil's ''Aeneid,'' the priest LaocoRated PG-13n entangled in the snake coils that kill him and his two sons.</p><p>The passage in Pliny that allowed instant identification raised more questions than it cleared up. Pliny said the group was carved from a single piece of marble, but artists, among them Michelangelo, threw doubt on that assertion. Pliny also attributed the work to a collaboration of three artists, which seemed an affront to any concept of the individual genius in antiquity (as well as to this work being wrought from a single stone). But most puzzling was his assertion that this group was ''a work superior to all other paintings or statues.'' Did this give ancient warrant for settling the contest between painting and sculpture for the highest rank of artistry? Books 35 and 36 of Pliny's ''Record of Nature'' were the principal source of Renaissance knowledge about ancient art theory and practice. Was his expertise vindicated or made suspect by this discovery? Did other parts of his work -- including a glorification of deceptive imitation -- gain or lose authority, now that his verdict on a specific artifact could be tested against the object itself?</p><p>The rediscovery of LaocoRated PG-13n, Leonard Barkan argues in ''Unearthing the Past,'' was just beginning. It must be read over and over again -- for instance, in conjunction with Virgil's treatment of the same subject. Its lost parts must be restored. Its place in history and canonical rank must be refined, its usefulness to contemporary artists explored.</p><p>Barkan, a professor of humanities, English and fine arts at New York University, embarks on this quest along with the people he is studying, rereading Pliny with them, debating proposed restorations, assessing reproductions, watching Michelangelo study the anatomy of LaocoRated PG-13n and his sons as he makes male nudes repeat their writhings on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The excitements and puzzlements of the quest are conjured up for us. What he does so brilliantly for the LaocoRated PG-13n Barkan goes on to do for other statues literally unearthed or otherwise brought to light during the Renaissance -- the Spinario (boy taking thorn from foot), the Arrotino (man sharpening knife), the sleeping Ariadne, the Pasquino (soldier carrying a body), various river gods, various crouching Venuses, the sleeping Hermaphrodite.</p><p>The Renaissance obsession with these objects, lavishly documented here, raises the question how Renaissance painters and sculptors could be so original and creative, yet proclaim that they were being imitative and subordinate to the past. Barkan shows that their reading of Pliny was not so slavish as one might have expected. Besides, they were often chasing phantoms, or trying to reconcile different judgments on the works they dealt with. For one thing, these fragments of a rich past were clues for imagining that past as their ambience, and yet the assumptions about historical context threw a distorting atmosphere all around the objects.</p><p>In a bravura passage, Barkan describes how the Renaissance read its way backward in time to ''unearth'' Rome by reading Virgil's projection forward in time describing the empire's future in Book 6 of the ''Aeneid.'' Both visionary efforts passed through their ostensible object to achieve union as an embrace of ghosts. This book is a teasing exploration of such epistemological mysteries in the history of art. It describes the elusiveness of imitation as a goal, the creative force of dialogue with uncertainty and the way truth in art grows cheekily out of historical falsehoods.</p><p>The most important and artistically valuable ancient object that Barkan treats is the Belvedere torso -- which was thought to be the trunk of a seated Hercules. The torso was a touchstone for Michelangelo, much of whose work was a meditation on it, a playing of variations on it. Though Barkan treats other misattributions, he does not explore the possibility -- now a near certainty -- that the torso is not of Hercules but of Marsyas. The figure is seated on a Phrygian leopard skin, not on Hercules' lion skin, and though Barkan acknowledges that fact, and says that some now think the figure is of Philoctetes or Marsyas, he does not take seriously the powerful case Gosta Saflund has made that the dowel holes for added parts on the statue prove that its arms were bound behind its back, in the well-known pose of the Phrygian flute player Marsyas, waiting to be flayed by Apollo for challenging him in a music contest. The pose shows up on Attic vase paintings, but it was best known in the Renaissance from a famous ancient medallion in the Florentine palace of Michelangelo's patrons, the Medici. If Michelangelo did not see the original there, he could have seen one of its many reproductions. Would he have known that this carnelian figure was Marsyas? His friend Vasari did. Would he have connected it with the marble torso? Saflund shows that he often imitates the torso, in his carved slaves and painted nudes, with the arms drawn back, to achieve the torque of the stomach muscles in the Belvedere fragment.</p><p>Michelangelo's poems show that he was obsessed with the idea of binding and flaying. For the ''Last Judgment'' he put his own face on the flayed skin of St. Bartholomew, who twists his arm back holding the knife of his torture, flexing his trunk muscles in the Belvedere manner. If Michelangelo did not intuit or suspect that the torso was really Marsyas, he acted as if he did. Examining this possibility would have added another layer to Barkan's finely textured discussion. That he did not is the more surprising since he treats the Marsyas myth in describing the Arrotino (who sharpens the knife for Apollo to use on Marsyas), and he prints there a picture of the Medici medallion. Michelangelo quoted and admired Dante's use of the Marsyas myth. It was probably connected, consciously or unconsciously, with his love of the tortured Belvedere trunk.</p><p>Barkan does not miss many links as he traces the cat's cradle of cultural interconnections in this book rich in suggestion and analysis. It may seem ungrateful to notice one omission where he has given us so much. But it is not the least of the book's many virtues that it prompts further speculation. He guarantees that the rediscovering continues.</p><p>Photo: The Laocoon, a Roman marble copy of the first century A.D. from a Hellenistic original.
