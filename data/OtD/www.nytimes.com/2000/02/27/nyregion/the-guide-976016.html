                    <p>Dali and Lorca</p><p>In conjunction with the Salvador Dali exhibition, the Wadsworth Atheneum will honor one of the painter's friends, Federico Garcia Lorca, the poet, on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the museum theater.</p><p>The relationship between the two men will be discussed by Wayne H.

His talk will be followed by readings of Lorca's poetry in Spanish and English by Naomi Ayala, a poet, educator and community activist, and by Rennie McQuilken, poet and director of the annual Sunken Garden Poetry Festival at the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington.</p><p>Lorca, known in Spain as a poet of the people, and recognized widely as one of his country's most celebrated literary figures, is probably best known for his lyric drama ''Blood Wedding,'' and for ''Gypsy Ballads.'' He died in 1936 at the age of 38, when he was executed by the Fascists for his Republican-left sympathies and, some scholars believe, for his homosexuality.</p>                </div>

Anthony'' in 1999.</p><p>Tickets are $15, $10 for adults over 64, $5 for students.
