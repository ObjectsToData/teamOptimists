                    <p>The exhibition will remain through March 17 in the college's School of Art and Design, where Mr. Frasconi has taught since 1973 and is a Distinguished Professor of Art and Design.</p><p>Celebrated as an artist and a champion of the woodcut as an art form, Mr. Frasconi is represented in many of the world's major museums. He has been the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships and many awards from institutions, including the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the National Academy of Design.</p><p>The number to call for more information is 251-6750.</p><p>Women's Conference</p><p>The second annual Women's History Month Conference at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, entitled ''From the Other Side of Prosperity: Women Speak Out,'' will open on Friday at 5 p.m., when registration takes place, and will continue until 9 p.m. Registration will also take place on Saturday at 8:30 a.m., followed by 15 panel discussions, which will fill the day until 5:30 p.m. A reception, a poetry reading and a theatrical presentation will take place from 6 to 9 p.m.</p><p>Utrice Leid, producer and host of Talk Back, a call-in show on WBAI-FM (99.5), will deliver the keynote address on Friday at 7 p.m. ''The Secret Childhood Diary of a Welfare Mother'' will be presented at 8 p.m. as a dramatic monologue by Linda Carney.</p><p>The panel discussions on Saturday offer a broad range of subjects, to be explored by dozens of experts. A sampling includes representatives of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union and members of the Federation of University Employes at Yale University.</p><p>Admission is free; box lunches will be available for $5. The number to call for more information is 395-2405.</p><p>Story of Lost Treasure</p><p>A story of buried treasure will unfold in a lecture by Peter Lourie tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the Chappaqua Library, 195 South Greeley Avenue. The program is suitable for families.</p><p>The subject so enthralled Mr. Lourie that he wrote two books about it, one for adults and one for children. They are called, respectively, ''Sweat of the Sun, Tears of the Moon,'' published by the University of Nebraska Press, and ''The Lost Treasure of the Inca,'' published by Caroline House in Honedale, Pa.</p><p>Actually, the treasure was not buried but sunk to the bottom of a man-made sea situated in a high forest of the Andes in Ecuador. According to Inca and Spanish lore, the treasure -- a cache of solid gold worth $8 billion in today's market -- disappeared in 1534.</p><p>The program is co-sponsored by the Saw Mill River Audubon Society, and admission is free. Call 238-4779 for more information.</p><p>Sketches and Photos</p><p>''French Lessons,'' an exhibition of oil sketches by Karen Beckwith, and ''Waterworks,'' photographs by Scott Barrow on the interplay of light and water, comprise a new exhibition opening next Saturday at the Garrison Art Center in Garrison's Landing. A reception will be held from 2 to 4 p.m., and the show will remain through March 26.</p><p>Ms. Beckwith's small-scale works of her travels in Paris and Normandy last spring are representational but dreamlike.</p><p>Mr. Barrow has been a commercial photographer for a quarter of a century. His work has been published in countless magazines, books and advertisements, and he has received more than 50 awards.</p><p>Viewing hours are noon to 5 p.m. seven days a week, and the number to call for information is 424-3960.</p><p>Organizing Women</p><p>Westchester women, including those in college, are encouraged to attend the second annual breakfast meeting of the Office of Multicultural Affairs at Manhattanville College. Elinor Guggenheim, founder of the New York Women's Agenda and the New York City Women's Forum, will be the keynote speaker, focusing on the importance of women to organize in support of programs that affect their lives and the lives of their families.</p><p>The event will take place next Saturday at 9 a.m. in Reid Castle of Manhattanville College. A list of Manhattanville's co-sponsors includes the College of New Rochelle Women's Studies Program, Westchester League of Women Voters, Westchester Community College Job Star Program, Westchester Inter-Racial Women's Leadership Roundtable, Women's News and the Y.W.C.A. of White Plains and Central Westchester.</p><p>The breakfast will provide opportunities for networking among women of different generations and backgrounds. Admission is free. To register, call 323-5186.</p><p>Show at Hopper House</p><p>A dual exhibition of boldly colorful nonrepresentational paintings and drawings by Paula Madawick and Thorpe Feidt may be seen at the Edward Hopper House Art Center in Nyack through March 26.</p><p>Ms. Madawick's oils and her colored and graphic pencil drawings have been shown at the Castelli Gallery and the National Arts Club in Manhattan, the Silvermine Arts Center in New Canaan, the Bergen Museum in New Jersey and the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass. Her work is in many private and corporate collections. Eleven of her works are in the Hopper House show, including a 99-by-74-inch wall rubbing entitled ''Homage to Hopper.''</p><p>Herman Melville's novel ''Pierre or the Ambiguities'' was the inspiration for Mr. Feidt's series of paintings and drawings, which he calls ''The Ambiguities.'' Twelve of the 342 oils, etchings and drawings, which he has completed since he began the series in 1975, are in the show.</p><p>Mr. Feidt is an associate professor at the Montserrat College of Art in Beverly, Mass., and he teaches a humanities course at the University of New Hampshire in Manchester. During his 30-year career he has had solo exhibitions throughout the Northeast.</p><p>The Hopper Art Center, where Edward Hopper lived as a boy, is at 82 North Broadway. Admission is by donation.
