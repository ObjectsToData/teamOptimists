It is called, ''James Thurber, the Life and Hard Times,'' a title takeoff on Thurber's celebrated short story compendium, ''My Life and Hard Times.'' The film, due out late this year, is being financed in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities.     In 1994, Mr. Van Doren, then 31, produced and directed ''Mark Van Doren: Portrait of a Poet,'' a documentary about his Pulitzer Prize-winning grandfather and a close friend of Thurber's in Cornwall.

                    <p>Q. What is a documentary?</p><p>A. A non-fiction work. There are two major types: historical, where you piece together interviews and work with archives, or you can follow an event as it actually takes place, live action which is cinema verite. I specialize in the historical.</p><p>Q. How did you jump from architecture to filmmaking?</p><p>A. Architects like to know all about everything. It makes you think about a lot of subjects and how they can be integrated. The film is a piecing together of bits and pieces, like a building. Liberal arts have always been important in my family. It's a way of thinking about ideas. You don't have to be specialized.</p><p>Q. What inspired you to make the Thurber film?</p><p>A. I find the best projects are the ones under your nose. Why not do subjects that are right in your backyard, have familiarity? It has something inside that you can draw from. Thurber inspired me partly because I was always aware of his presence,  even though I never met him, because he was very close with my  grandparents. There were all his books around the house, and he had this very distinctive handwriting. He was blind for the last half of his life, and he'd always sign the inside of his books in huge handwriting. This was fascinating. And the cartoons grabbed me as a young person</p><p>Q. What of family's influence on your interest in the realm of ideas?</p><p>A. My mother, Mira, is an artist, painter. My father, John, worked at Encyclopedia Britannica for many years. My Uncle Charlie also worked there. My father was also an English professor -- at Smith, Brandeis and Boston University. The interest in history, biography, all was there. I was always surrounded by books, and it allowed me to live in a world with these wonderful people I didn't have the chance to know.</p><p>I knew my grandfather very well until I was 10. I spent the summers in Cornwall. He'd take his nap; I enjoyed playing piano for him. It's a feeling tone that meant a lot to me. My grandmother, Dorothy, was a great repository for family history. She wrote about in Cornwall in ''The Country Wife.''</p><p>Q. When did the Van Dorens come to Connecticut?</p><p>A. My great-uncle Carl Van Doren lived here in 1913. Carl introduced Cornwall to my grandfather. Mark bought a farm with Dorothy in 1927.</p><p>Q. And Thurber?</p><p>A. My grandfather and Thurber met in Martha's Vineyard in 1941. Thurber was going through a tremendously difficult period. His sight was deteriorating. He had had one eye since he was a young person. His brother shot him with an arrow. It was an accident.</p><p>Once they came here to Cornwall, they had ties -- Mark Van Doren, James Thurber, Lewis Gannett, William Shirer. William Shirer, whom I interviewed for the film, called them the Cornwall Quartet. They used to meet every Saturday. Cornwall meant a great deal to James Thurber. He called his house ''The Great Good Place.'' His great story, ''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,'' is about a person who's on a drive in Connecticut.</p><p>Q. Why do you think Thurber is unusual?</p><p>A. Because of his dual talents. He considered his most important contribution was as a writer. He'd be upset if he knew many think of him just as a cartoonist, because he never took that as seriously.</p><p>Q. What distinguishes Thurber's time in literature?</p><p>A. Sinclair Lewis, James Thurber, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald -- that era was the first time that Americans felt like they had established their own literary voice. The English -- Henry James, Dickens -- were no longer No. 1. Suddenly we had a voice, an American sensibility.</p><p>Q. Have Thurber's works addressed today's follies, like pollution and violence?</p><p>A. Well, they didn't have those things back then. He would have dealt with the bureaucracy. He couldn't stand the machines and the gadgetries of the 1940's and 30's. He had this great cartoon of a man being trapped by a typewriter ribbon. He wrote ''The Last Flower,'' based on the atomic explosion, that showed the whole world coming down to one last flower, and he wrote that straight for two days, captions and drawings, a pictorial book.</p><p>Q. Which of Thurber's works exhibits best his insight into human nature?</p>                </div>
