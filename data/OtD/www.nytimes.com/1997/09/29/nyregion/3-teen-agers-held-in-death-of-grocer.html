As residents mourned the loss of their grocer, a popular local figure, they said they were stunned to learn that the suspects arrested by the police were all youths from the neighborhood.</p><p>The gunman is 15 years old, the police said, and his accomplices are 17 and 19.</p><p>The suspects lived within a few blocks of the F.A.S. Suprette, the grocery store on Second Avenue near 28th Street that was owned by the victim, Dong K. Lee, 37. In the two years that Mr. Lee owned the store, neighbors said, he had won over customers with his friendly demeanor, efficient service and generosity in extending credit to those short of cash.</p><p>The police said that after Mr. Lee was slain, about a half-dozen concerned neighbors made anonymous telephone calls to the Police Department's tips line.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''All the callers indicated the same thing: that he was very well-liked,'' said Deputy Inspector Joseph D'Amico, the commanding officer of Manhattan South detective operations.</p><p>Working from several of the tips, including the first name of one of the suspects, detectives from the 13th Precinct came up with the full names and addresses of the suspects. Late Saturday night, less than 24 hours after the shooting, they picked up three suspects. The police said they recovered the murder weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, as well as a .22-caliber revolver and one of the stocking masks worn by the robbers.</p><p>The police identified the suspects as Erwin Ruiz, 15, who is accused of shooting Mr. Lee; Patrick Michael, 17, and Angel Martinez, 19.</p><p>Inspector D'Amico said that all three of the suspects had signed written statements confessing to the crime and that two had made videotaped confessions.</p><p>The suspects will be tried as adults on charges of second-degree murder, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.</p><p>Residents of the neighborhood were stunned that three neighborhood youths were being accused of the killing. ''All three of these boys used to go to church,'' said Theresa Bruce, 35. ''I don't know what happened to them. Mr. Lee was nice. He used to give me free baby food sometimes.''</p><p>It was apparently a robbery gone awry, the police said. After watching Mr. Lee's routine for several days, the police said, the teen-agers decided to rob him early Saturday morning.</p><p>Mr. Lee locked up the grocery store at around 1:30 A.M. and walked two blocks south with two of his employees to a garage, the Quik Park Garage on East 26th Street, the police said. Mr. Lee often drove his employees home before returning to the house in Queens that he shared with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter.</p><p>When Mr. Lee and the workers reached his light-gray Cadillac at 1:40 A.M., they were met by the three teen-agers, who wore stocking masks and brandished guns, Inspector D'Amico said.</p><p>One of the youths told Mr. Lee that he was being robbed and ordered him not to move, Deputy Inspector D'Amico said. Moments later, possibly after a struggle or a moment's hesitation, Mr. Lee was shot in the face and killed, the police said. The three teen-agers fled with Mr. Lee's bag, the police said.</p><p>''The males apparently thought he had store receipts with him,'' Inspector D'Amico said. ''In reality he only had personal effects in the bag.''  Neighbors said that Mr. Michael and Mr. Ruiz were students at the High School for the Humanities, and that Mr. Martinez attended Norman Thomas High School.</p><p>Family members reached at the teen-agers' homes yesterday were grappling with news of the arrests.</p><p>Mr. Michael's half-brother, Jimmy Lessen, 28, said: ''This has never happened to anybody in our family. Patrick was hanging out with a bad crowd.''</p><p>A man who said he was Mr. Ruiz's older brother, but who would not give his name, said: ''I'm hoping this is a dream. We don't know the whole story. This may have been an accident.''</p><p>Mr. Martinez's cousin, Janet Green, 27, said that he liked mostly to play basketball and spend time with his 7-month-old son. ''Angel's a good father,'' she said. ''I can't picture them doing this, especially my cousin. Mr. Lee is a wonderful man. I used to buy coffee from him all the time.''</p><p>Carmen Perez, 26, said she knew all three teen-agers from the Madison Square Boys Club on East 29th Street, where she works as a counselor. ''I'm in a state of shock,'' she said. ''I know all of these kids. They're all from good homes. This has to have something to do with peer pressure.''</p><p>Outside the grocery store, more than two dozen bouquets of flowers were placed in a makeshift memorial. Cards in English, Spanish and Korean were full of condolences, good wishes and prayers to God and Allah. Votive candles served as paperweights on a poster advertising the Crimestoppers tips line. ''You brought us joy through your service,'' a card said.</p><p>Photos: Customers have been bringing flowers and candles to the F.A.S.
