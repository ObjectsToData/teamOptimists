    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="For nearly 30 years Charles Burnett has struggled quietly to make films about the black experience in the United States, only to see his work ignored by movie studios and remain largely unnoticed by most moviegoers, perhaps because his films have no gangs or guns.    ''I have no interest to do cars banging into each other; I don't have the talent to pull that sort of thing off,'' Mr. Burnett said the other afternoon, breaking into a smile. ''Most of the films I like to do aren't very commercial. They're not high concept. They're hard to pitch to executives. They're character-driven and theme-driven. I mean, I'm not trying to be sophisticated, but my movies are not designed for 18-year-olds.''  ">

	data-description="For nearly 30 years Charles Burnett has struggled quietly to make films about the black experience in the United States, only to see his work ignored by movie studios and remain largely unnoticed by most moviegoers, perhaps because his films have no gangs or guns.    ''I have no interest to do cars banging into each other; I don't have the talent to pull that sort of thing off,'' Mr. Burnett said the other afternoon, breaking into a smile. ''Most of the films I like to do aren't very commercial. They're not high concept. They're hard to pitch to executives. They're character-driven and theme-driven. I mean, I'm not trying to be sophisticated, but my movies are not designed for 18-year-olds.''  "></div>

                    <p>For nearly 30 years Charles Burnett has struggled quietly to make films about the black experience in the United States, only to see his work ignored by movie studios and remain largely unnoticed by most moviegoers, perhaps because his films have no gangs or guns.</p><p>''I have no interest to do cars banging into each other; I don't have the talent to pull that sort of thing off,'' Mr. Burnett said the other afternoon, breaking into a smile. ''Most of the films I like to do aren't very commercial. They're not high concept. They're hard to pitch to executives. They're character-driven and theme-driven. I mean, I'm not trying to be sophisticated, but my movies are not designed for 18-year-olds.''</p><p>Although critics have called Mr. Burnett, who is 51, the nation's least-known great  film maker and most gifted black director, he laughed gently at those labels, because his life seems a constant financial struggle and he has such difficulty raising the money  to make movies. ''I sometimes wish I could do something else, but I can't,'' he said during an interview in a West Hollywood restaurant.</p><p>The film maker, whose best-known movie is the 1990 drama ''To Sleep With Anger,''  starring Danny Glover, is to be honored in a program that starts tomorrow at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center and runs through Feb. 13. Presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, Mr. Burnett is being acknowledged for his depiction of ''everyday heroes.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>His films deal with people he grew up with, essentially black couples and families struggling to deal with the reality of their lives. His first film was ''Killer of Sheep,'' in 1977, which won top awards at various festivals. It deals with a meat packer in the Watts section of Los Angeles who is laid off from his job and tries to remain a loving husband and father in a blighted environment. ''Killer of Sheep'' was among the first 50 films listed by the Library of Congress in the National Film Registry because of their significance.</p><p>''To Sleep With Anger,'' which was made on a shoestring budget of $1.4 million and only after Mr. Glover's involvement, was a contemporary family drama set in Los Angeles but against a backdrop of Southern black folklore. Despite enthusiastic reviews, the movie failed to attract large audiences, even among blacks.</p><p>Mr. Burnett's most recent film, ''The Glass Shield,'' was made in 1995 and deals with a naive black police officer who finds himself assigned to a corrupt white sheriff's department in Los Angeles. That movie, too, earned good reviews but did not appeal to large audiences. ''Until you achieve a box-office hit, you're on the fringes, so to speak,'' said Mr. Burnett. ''Every movie is hard, particularly serious drama. Black themes are even harder.''</p><p>Mr. Burnett acknowledged that he's often frustrated by and even angry about the quality of films made about blacks, which tend to depict their communities as violent and malevolent. Most of those movies, he acknowledged, are made by blacks.</p><p>''I'm sort of angry at the fact that there's this focus on certain kinds of films, and it's created this perception of black people,'' he said. Mr. Burnett is married to Gaye Burnett, a costume designer, lives in a middle-class neighborhood and has two young sons.</p><p>''Many of the people I know are desperately worried that if they miss a paycheck, they'll go homeless,'' he said. ''They're concerned about their family, about bringing up kids, about dealing with a young man coming of age, about peer groups. I mean there are so many issues to be confronted in films that we don't see. There's human comedy, there's human tragedy. We don't see it.''</p><p>Then why do many black directors make films that may be embarrassing to blacks? ''Black directors are responding to what the studios perceive black audiences want,'' said Mr. Burnett. ''Like they want to do 'Boyz N the Hood' umpteen times.''</p><p>Mr. Burnett is hardly alone in his effort to look beyond ghetto violence and move toward more expansive themes in films about blacks. But studio executives privately admit that a recent spate of high-profile disappointments has stirred uncertainty about tackling less predictable stories involving black issues. Spike Lee's recent films, including ''Clockers,'' based on the Richard Price novel about the struggles of young black men in a housing project, and his modest ''Get on the Bus,'' about the Million Man March in Washington, failed to generate much enthusiasm even among black audiences.</p><p>''The Preacher's Wife,'' starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston, the costliest picture ever made with an all-black cast, has grossed about $45 million, half of it  going to theater owners. The movie cost $55 million to $60 million to make and another $20 million to market. Another film that fared poorly at the box office was ''Devil in a Blue Dress,'' based on Walter Mosley's novel about a black detective and also starring Mr. Washington.</p><p>Studio executives are now awaiting audience reaction to John Singleton's ''Rosewood,'' based on real-life events in which a black town in Florida was burned to the ground and several of its residents killed in 1923  after a white woman accused a black man there of assaulting her. The movie, released by Warner Brothers, opens on Feb. 21.</p>                </div>
