Already installed on its Madison Avenue side are the Science, Industry and Business branch of the New York Public Library and, in the tower, Oxford University Press.</p><p>The undertaking represents a considerable investment in a building that had sat idle since Altman's went out of business in 1989, until Oxford moved from across the street at 200 Madison Avenue in May 1995.  The Oxford project represented an outlay of $30 million, the library branch $100 million and the graduate school, $163 million.</p><p>Each organization owns a condominium interest in the building, with operations of facilities held in common, such as the freight elevator and roof, governed by a board made up of owners' representatives.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Peter L. Malkin, who with his partner Morton L. Olshan first became involved with the Altman properties in 1985, said selling the condominiums was a fallback strategy after efforts to redevelop the building or rent it were foiled by the real estate recession of the early 1990's. ''We spent a year and a half trying to develop the building as a showroom for the contract furniture industry, but the companies involved could not make it work,'' he said. ''So we took an alternative approach.''</p><p>Daniel A. Biederman, president of both the 34th Street and Grand Central Partnerships, which meet at the north end of the building at 35th Street, said he expects the graduate center to generate street traffic and night life in the surrounding area.</p><p>''It's almost like a residential conversion,'' he said.''You will have people walking around and spending money for food and other things and it will increase foot traffic at night.''</p><p>The whole building will be quite a bookish place. In addition to the public library branch, the graduate school will have its own library, and Oxford Press has a library for all the titles it currently has in print.</p><p>The new and prospective occupants of the building happily nod to their antecedents. ''People will still shop in this building, but now they will shop for ideas,'' said Frances Degen Horowitz, president of what is formally the Graduate School and University Center for CUNY. She said the graduate school's current location at 33 West 42 Street was no longer adequate for its needs, with faculty offices spread to two nearby buildings at a rental expense that was approaching $6 million a year.</p><p>''We outgrew the building,'' Dr. Horowitz said, noting that the graduate school only had a handful of programs when it opened in 1961, but now has 4,000 students. The 42d Street location was originally chosen, she said, so students would have easy access to the research collections at the main branch of the public library, which is almost directly across the street.</p><p>The location of the main branch dictated that the graduate school stay in the general neighborhood, Dr. Horowitz said, despite the presence in the same building of the Science, Industry and Business Library. ''SIBL has the technical data bases, but we had to have access to the humanities collections at the library,'' she said. ''It is just a few blocks' difference.'' Although inadequate for the graduate school, the state-owned building on 42d Street was deemed suitable for the State University of New York School of Optometry, which will move there from rented space once the floors have been remodeled to meet its needs.</p><p>Unlike other universities, where the graduate schools are part of an integrated academic community, the CUNY graduate school operates semi-autonomously, with a core faculty of about 100. The remaining 1,600 doctoral faculty are drawn from colleges within the university system. It is also decentralized, with science research and professional programs at college campuses around the city.</p><p>As the owner of a nonprofit condominium unit in the building, the school will be spared  the real estate taxes that are passed on to tenants in rental charges, although it will have to make payments to the State Dormitory Authority until the bonds used to finance the project are retired. The school will occupy 580,000 square feet of space on eight floors and a mezzanine along Fifth Avenue. Strollers who window-shopped the latest fashions in the past will be able to see graduate students studying in the library and study spaces near the display windows.</p><p>Since one of the needs of the school was for performance and meeting spaces, the big floors and high ceilings of the old store provided a good beginning. ''This building is well suited for adaptive reuse,'' said Robert Siegel, whose firm, Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, did the design work for both the graduate school and the library. ''It's really a grand old loft building with well-placed columns and none of the load-bearing walls  you often find in old buildings.''</p>                </div>
