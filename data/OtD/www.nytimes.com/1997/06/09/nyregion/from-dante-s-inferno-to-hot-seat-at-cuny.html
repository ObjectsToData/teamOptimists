                    <p>''The lack of communications between the Chancellor and the trustees is appalling,'' she said, adding that the trustees had been misled into believing they were just reinforcing an existing requirement. ''We're just not getting the proper response from the Chancellor.''</p><p>Chancellor Reynolds declined to be interviewed for this article, but issued a conciliatory statement commending Dr. Paolucci for her ''distinguished record in academic life.'' On Friday, Dr. Paolucci also turned down an interview request, calling this ''a difficult time.''</p><p>Her tenure comes at a difficult time for CUNY, too, a time when educational standards everywhere are being questioned, when public support for higher education has eroded and people who once would not have thought of college are surging into universities.</p><p>In New York, both the Mayor and the Governor have attacked CUNY -- a university populated by immigrants and others who are often poor and poorly educated and speak little or no English -- for allowing students to spend years in remedial courses and learning English.</p><p>Dr. Paolucci, a graduate of Barnard College and Columbia University who taught at City College for 10 years before moving to St. John's University, has expressed her own doubts about CUNY's standards. But until last month's quick decision to impose the English test requirement, she has tended to choose to set up committees to research issues like remediation and academic requirements rather than make immediate changes.</p><p>''We've ordered more investigations in six months than in the past 10 years,'' said Herman Badillo, CUNY's vice chairman and an adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. ''When there is a problem, she moves, she appoints people to investigate. That is the way it should be.''</p><p>A native of Rome who moved to New York at age 8, Dr. Paolucci has led an active academic life. She has turned out dozens of scholarly papers, translated Machiavelli and  published novels, poems and short stories while serving as chairwoman of the English department at St. John's and director of its doctor of arts program. She was also president of the Pirandello Society of America and a Reagan appointee to the National Council on the Humanities.</p><p>She returned to CUNY last summer as a trustee with the backing of State Senator Serphin R. Maltese of Queens, a former chairman of New York's Conservative Party, and was appointed chairwoman with the support of faculty members who hoped  she would listen to their concerns.</p><p>But as Dr. Paolucci admits, little in her experience prepared her for running a public university of 200,000 students or the often-fractious public board meetings every month at the trustees' headquarters on East 80th Street.</p><p>''This is a difficult job, a crazy job,'' she said recently. ''Working at St. John's -- in all my years -- was nothing, nothing, nothing compared to this.''</p><p>Her scholarship shows in flashes, as in her recent address to the City Council, when she captivated many with her allusions to Dante as she made the case for supporting public higher education. ''You suddenly saw a remarkable mind at work, a scholar any university would be proud to have,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College and close student of CUNY politics.</p><p>But he and others, including her allies on the board, say her inexperience shows in public meetings, where she sometimes rearranges the agenda at will, ignores parliamentary procedure and acts by fiat.</p><p>''Watching her chair a board meeting is watching someone go through on-the-job training,'' Professor Sherrill said.</p><p>Some trustees were surprised at the May board meeting, for example, when the chairmen of two committees sought to start their meetings early so they could cover more. Dr. Paolucci declined, telling the chairman of the committee on academic affairs that his committee should save time by not taking up a new test for CUNY students, a subject the committee had studied and been eager to bring to the board.</p><p>''I respectfully disagree,'' Jerome Berg, the committee's chairman, told her. ''Is this a one-person decision?''</p><p>''It has to be approved,'' she said, adding that she was not ready to consider the issue and that the decision was hers.</p><p>''What is your authority?'' Mr. Berg asked.</p><p>The only answer came from another trustee, Robert Price, who joked, ''Under the Old Testament: Deuteronomy.''</p><p>Laughter erupted. The meeting broke up.</p><p>''She has a mistaken impression as to her one vote and what it encompasses,'' Mr. Berg said last week. ''Just because she is chairwoman and doesn't like something, she has no right to keep the board from considering it.''</p><p>But Mr. Price, a business executive, said it was right and proper for her to exert her will, especially when she knew she had board support.</p><p>''Dr. Paolucci is trying to make sense out of a university where it's very difficult to get answers from certain individuals,'' he said, adding: ''I don't think she is supposed to be neutral. She's supposed to lead.''</p><p>The board was similarly split over her abrupt decision in March to cancel two searches for college presidents without consulting the chairman of either search committee.</p><p>As one trustee, Richard B. Stone, a Columbia law professor, put it in a terse exchange of memos, ''Issues of this importance should be aired out and determined by the entire Board and not relegated to the unilateral decision of the Chairperson.''</p><p>And in a heated exchange at a board meeting, Edith Everett, a trustee and chairwoman of one of the search committees, threatened to sue Dr. Paolucci and the trustees for not following board procedures. As a compromise, another trustee suggested creating a committee to study the search process. But the searches remained halted.</p><p>The biggest uproar yet has come from the board's sudden decision last month to require that community college graduates -- including those set to graduate this month -- pass the university's written test of English to receive their diplomas.</p><p>Dr. Paolucci allowed the proposal on the agenda without the usual public hearings and committee scrutiny.</p><p>Students suing the university over the test requirement claim the trustees violated their own bylaws. A hearing is set for next week in New York State Supreme Court.</p><p>Some trustees are seeking a way out. One, Sandi E. Cooper, chairwoman of the CUNY faculty senate and a CUNY trustee, proposed that this year's students be allowed to graduate if they meet their own colleges' requirements.</p><p>Dr. Paolucci, who has said she does not blame the students, said cryptically on Thursday that she was ''looking for a resolution,'' but that the trustees expected the Chancellor to carry out the policy.</p><p>''We'll see what happens,'' she said.</p><p>Photo: Dr. Anne A. Paolucci was congratulated by George Altomare, president of the Italian-American Labor Council, after receiving an award from Italian-American legislators in Albany yesterday. (Alan E.
