He doesn't eat red meat, either. He orders a bottle of water rather than a glass of wine.

He doesn't eat red meat, either. He orders a bottle of water rather than a glass of wine.</p><p>''I'm pretty basic,'' he says, and he starts in on a fetching green salad that meets his approval and sips from his water glass, here in this three-star Manhattan restaurant.</p><p>Mr. Casey, a tall, handsome actor usually associated with action films, is not as simple as his taste buds. He is a poet and a painter with a doctorate in the humanities from the Savannah College of Art and Design, in Georgia, but at 58 he is best known for films like ''Revenge of the Nerds,'' ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,'' ''Sharky's Machine'' and ''Cleopatra Jones.''</p><p>His debut tomorrow as a writer, producer and director, however, will be for a film that is the antithesis of that kind of souffle-light action drama. The film, entitled ''The Dinner,'' has as its centerpiece three African-American men sitting around a dinner table talking in raw terms about race.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Casey says the sex in the film is not graphic, the violence is minimal and there is no profanity. The bite in ''The Dinner'' comes from the volatile subjects the men explore over a leisurely restaurant meal: slavery, black self-loathing, homophobia, white superiority, the Founding Fathers, black crime. Given the plethora of black action films and movies featuring young blacks in urban settings, it is a work certain to generate discussion and controversy.</p><p>In fact, Mr. Casey has been told (by some blacks, no less) that because his three characters are so dignified, articulate and sophisticated, they seem less than racially authentic. Mr. Casey calls that view self-hatred, a buying-into of demonic images of blacks as stupid, criminal and emotional. He does not do ebonics.</p><p>''I was on a radio talk show this morning and the host said, 'Can I ax you a question?' '' Mr. Casey said, visibly bristling. ''I said no, but you can ask me a question. He laughed, but he said, 'O.K., can I ask you a question?' ''</p><p>''I always challenge young people who talk ebonics and use a lot of profanity to become more literate, to find the words to express what they mean,'' Mr. Casey said. ''We need to understand the power of words.''</p><p>''The Dinner'' opens the fifth annual Contemporary African Diaspora Film Festival. The two-week festival is a showcase for the work of black filmmakers throughout the world. This year, 40 feature films and shorts, dramas and documentaries from North Africa, the Caribbean, South America and elsewhere will be shown on three screens, at Cinema Village in Greenwich Village, the Miller Theater at Columbia University in Morningside Heights and the Victoria V Theater in Harlem.</p><p>Mr. Casey raised the money for the film from a consortium of businessmen in Savannah, the film's setting, knowing that its subject matter would not be palatable to Hollywood. He won't say what it cost to make, but says it took only four weeks to shoot, after playing inside his head for years.</p><p>''Some people are disquieted by it,'' Mr. Casey said of his labor of love, which is based on real-life conversations he had with friends about the same topics. ''What we say has some scathing truths, but we say it so matter-of-factly. We're not pounding on the table. I wanted to make a film that housed images we had not seen and voices we had not heard.''</p><p>Marcus Samuelsson, Aquavit's celebrated young executive chef, stopped by to say hello to Mr. Casey. Mr. Samuelsson is a native of Ethiopia, a circumstance that brought a certain look of delight to Mr. Casey. They chatted about how much they  both liked ''Eve's Bayou,'' a film about a black Louisiana family that never raises the issue of race. Mr. Casey complimented Mr. Samuelsson on his salad and the sea bass he had chosen as an entree. Mr. Samuelsson, in turn, said he looked forward to ''The Dinner.''</p><p>The film is so much from the heart that the two actors who play Mr. Casey's friends in the film are longtime buddies. Their conversation is improvised and set to a sensuous jazz score. Mr. Casey handed the actors just a bare outline of who the characters were and what topics they would explore.</p><p>None of the characters have names. Mr. Casey plays Good Brother, a dynamic, worldly man who appears to be an art dealer but also seems to be involved in politics as well as having an affair with a white woman. Wren T. Brown plays Young Brother, an obviously well-educated, successful character who is young enough to be Good Brother's son. Brother Man, played by Doug Johnson, is a trumpet player who is a bit more conservative than his two friends, questioning why black youths seem so lost and whether the Founding Fathers were die-hard racists or simply self-serving elitists.</p><p>''Most people don't know us, as African-Americans,'' Mr. Casey said of his decision not to give the characters names. ''Even those of us who are greatly celebrated. We are so expendable we have no history in the context of the nation.''</p><p>It becomes clear over lunch that the boundaries between Mr. Casey and Good Brother can be fuzzy. Mr. Casey, who carries himself with the utmost dignity, like Good Brother, loves to talk and often does so on college campuses. He is opinionated on an array of subjects and saw ''The Dinner'' as his chance to get a lot off his chest.</p><p>He says he thinks that many young blacks are without hope, that white people are disdainful of black people, that Hollywood purposely markets films that make black people look pathological. Good Brother riffs on all these issues.</p><p>''It's basically a talking-heads movie,'' Mr. Casey said. ''It's purposely didactic. I'm talking to anybody, but I want white people to hear what I'm saying.''</p><p>''We are naive about the importance of images,'' he said of blacks, as he delicately finished his entree. ''I talk to young black filmmakers,  and they say they want to be real. I tell them that James Bond is not real, Tarzan is not real. It's propaganda. We don't understand the worth of creating strong images that don't impact on our people in a negative way.''</p><p>''You make the statement you want to make,'' he said, sounding like both himself and a universal Good Brother. ''You hold true to your own vision.''</p><p>Photo: Bernie Casey. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)(pg. E8)  </p>                </div>
