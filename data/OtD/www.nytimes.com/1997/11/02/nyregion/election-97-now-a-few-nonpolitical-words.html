                    <p>Q. What did he teach you?</p><p>A. English with a minor in discipline. He was tremendous. Oh God, syntax. When he reads this I'm going to get a call. I'm serious. Richard Pious at Barnard, for his course on the American Presidency. Literally brilliant. Richard Brilliant, his course on arts and humanities at Columbia. I think he corrected my grammar more than he corrected my limited insights into art history.</p><p>Q What grade did Father Regis teach?</p><p>A. It was high school. Sophomore, junior.</p><p>Q. And what was it about him?</p><p>A. He was just tough. He was tough. He was tough.</p><p>Oh, and the other one was Dr. Alban. He was tremendous. He taught advanced-placement English. He was the former chairman of the English department at Harvard and he retired in Metuchen. He had a degree from Harvard, a Ph.D. from Harvard and from Oxford and he taught advanced-placement English. And he was tremendous. We were learning, just the excitement of learning. He was teaching us how to think and he's passed on. He was one of the most ethical men I've ever had the occasion of meeting.</p><p>Theology is a favorite of mine. (Transcript unclear). Teilhard de  Chardin. Why are we scrambling around on this molten rock of lava? And it's interesting, I was sort of raised a devout Catholic and you go through a -- sort of this, every person goes through this spiritual angst. And you sort of doubt your faith and then you go through it and I read everything. I have a lot of friends of mine, friends in college were Orthodox Jews and I think they have it right. They just don't question.</p><p>Q. Do you question?</p><p>A. No. You read Aquinas and he comes up with all these answers, but ultimately it's just -- ultimately it comes down to faith. And that's what it ultimately comes down to and how one sees and that's why when you talk about the ministers. I talk about people like Calvin McKinney, he means a lot to me on a personal level. I talk about somebody like Charlie Kushner whose parents are survivors, it means having run this race well and having been touched and touched people for whom you have great respect.</p><p>At 7 o'clock last Sunday I was sitting in Pastor McKinney's church. It was just me and the choir. I think Catholics had the Baptists outnumbered. I got there early. By the end of the day I was with a friend of mine,  Margaret Feldman, who's a survivor of four camps. I was at St. Gertrude's in Newark bringing out the statue of St. Gertrude, the patron saint of pregnancies. It doesn't get better than this. And I ate my way through every stop. If you love people, if you love life it's a great opportunity to meet -- let me just leave you with this.</p><p>My favorite city, I used to think my favorite city in the world was Dublin. Now it's Jerusalem. I had the occasion to go there and it's the passion for life that's exciting. Whether you're in the Old City and you're in the Arab quarter or the Jewish quarter or the Christian quarter or the Orthodox quarter, it's the passion people have for life. It's the passion that people have for commitment, it's the passion that people have and frequently passion when it's constructive it's expressed whether it's through faith or through action. The Jesuits have a motto ''Faith through Action,'' which was a principle of St. Ignatius of Loyola. I think that's what it comes down to. It's just, you've got so many years left doing it, doing it well and being principled about how you do it.</p><p>Q. What would you do if you were banned from the world of politics?</p><p>A. Be a teacher.</p><p>Q. Be a teacher. But what grade?</p><p>A. That's harder. I taught -- I taught when I was in law school at Georgetown and I also was at Harvard to do my master's in education. I also undertook certain -- I also taught as a volunteer. Probably seventh or eighth grade.</p><p>Q. Any particular subject?</p><p>A. History.</p><p>Q. And where? Woodbridge?</p><p>A. That's the right answer.</p><p>Q. Catholic school or public school?</p><p>A. Either. I enjoyed them both. Enjoyed both. I mean children -- I mean children are children. It's about giving them the opportunity. It's about challenging their minds. I love teaching.</p><p>Whitman</p><p>Q. Who was the most influential teacher in your life?</p><p>A. Betty Noling. In primary school, she taught English. She taught grammar. She taught Latin. She taught history. She did all the music. And she was an absolute bear for vocabulary and grammar. She was Anglophile so we had to memorize the names of all of the kings of England, the history of England. She loved Macbeth, and all Shakespeare, So I learned a lot of Shakespeare, memorization. You had to memorize long passages of it, which was very good for discipline. And she was very focused on you have to be precise in your work. She taught creative writing as well, poetry and stories. I loved creative writing.</p><p>Q. What grade did she teach?</p><p>A. She taught English and she did all the plays, starting in first grade. She taught something all the way through. She only taught music to the lower schools. And she taught sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth grades. You could have her for English, history, or grammar, or creative writing.</p><p>Q. If you were banned from politics tomorrow, what would you do?</p><p>A. Oh, I'd go see the next one of Taylor's games. I did sneak away last weekend. I read that I was supposedly relaxing on Sunday. Well, it was relaxing. It was wonderful. I went up and saw him play lacrosse. But no, I'd go make sure that I got more than one lacrosse game and hockey game and everything a season. I'd spend a lot more time with the kids and more time outdoors getting exercise.</p>                </div>
