It is not a straight commercial proposition -- outside financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Henry Luce Foundation and various individuals in Asia and America provided about half of the $545,000 cost of the book and the project to date.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But the venture holds lessons for any American publisher interested in doing business in China, and is a sign of the new kinds of relationships being forged there.</p><p>For almost 20 years, American publishers have coveted the vast potential market in China. A few of the established international houses and textbook and reference publishers like John Wiley &amp; Sons, Springer-Verlag of Germany and Oxford University Press have spent years cultivating relationships with the Chinese and selling them scientific and technical books or English-language teaching materials.</p><p>''In the early 1980's, John Wiley's revenues from China were as high as $1 million in one year resulting from book and journal purchases Chinese libraries made with World Bank loan money,'' said Deborah E. Wiley, a senior vice president of the company.</p><p>During that period, large American trade publishers like Random House, a unit of Advance Publications, Bantam and Harper &amp; Row -- now HarperCollins, a division of the News Corporation -- along with some smaller publishers, went on forays to China, but many declined to enter the very foreign publishing market they found there. There was no copyright law, the retail price of books was very low, the state-controlled distribution network was bogged down in bureaucracy and marketing was nonexistent.</p><p>Bantam did sell some English-language paperbacks in tourist hotels and state-run foreign languages bookstores. Peter Mayer, the former chairman of Penguin, the publishing arm of Pearson P.L.C., negotiated an agreement licensing paperback reprints of such Penguin classics as ''Jane Eyre,'' ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Women in Love.'' But, he said: ''It was never meant to be lucrative. We thought by having a publishing relationship in China eventually there would be real opportunities for buying and selling books.''</p><p>James Peck, the executive editor of the Yale-Foreign Languages Press project, said that part of the difficulty in doing business in China in the 1980's was that ''trade publishers could not find a way to overcome the problems of China not having copyright and not being able to pay the foreign publisher and author royalties in foreign currency.''</p><p>For example, he said that Bantam sold ''Iacocca'' to one Chinese press, but multiple pirated versions were brought out by others.</p><p>Rights sales for individual titles have been growing, however, since China passed copyright legislation and, in 1990, acceded to the Berne international convention, which requires that the Chinese publisher obtain copyright from the copyright holder and that the contract between them specify the financial responsibilities for the sale of the book.</p><p>The most desirable titles, like ''The Road Ahead'' by William H. Gates 3d have fetched royalty advances of $50,000 or so. Elton Welke, the publisher of Microsoft Press, said that after Berne, ''the relationship with the Chinese was more comfortable, it became easier to work together.''</p><p>The Chinese also pay for books associated with American films. Huang Youyi, the vice director general of the Foreign Languages Publishing Administration, who is responsible for the Yale-Foreign Languages Press series on the Chinese side, said that books based on ''The English Patient'' and ''The Bridges of Madison County'' have been hits.</p><p>The Yale project had deep roots and shows the importance of long-term personal relationships in dealing with China. Mr. Peck did graduate work in Chinese at Harvard in the 1960's and then, as an editor at Random House Inc.'s Pantheon Books, published a number of books about China and wrote two himself.</p><p>Mr. Peck recalled that in 1985, Robert Bernstein, then the chairman of Random House, ''asked me to look into why Random had been unable to establish a publishing relationship with China; I recommended that we adopt a much more flexible approach about royalty payments and copyright questions and that we link up with two publishers, one of whom was the F.L.P.''</p><p>But Mr. Bernstein was removed as Random House chairman in the fall of 1989 and Mr. Peck also left the company. Only a few contracts had actually been signed. The next  spring, Mr. Bernstein mentioned the groundwork that he and Mr. Peck had laid to John Ryden, director of the Yale University Press. Eventually, ''The Culture and Civilization of China'' series was conceived and a contract signed at the end of 1991.</p><p>All publishing in China is ultimately state controlled (apart from the illegal trade in pirated or banned material), and forging personal connections within China has proved useful to some other publishers.</p><p>During the last two years, Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., set up an office in Beijing. Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company whose divisions include the American publishers Bantam, Doubleday and Dell, set up a joint-venture direct sales operation, a book club and other ventures in Shanghai.</p><p>Foreign publishers are learning that they need to employ Chinese and Americans who can straddle both worlds. Martin Maleska, president of Simon &amp; Schuster International, said, ''By putting people on the ground there we better understand the needs of this emerging information market.''</p><p>Photo: When President Jiang Zemin of China met with President Clinton last week, he presented him with a copy of ''Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting.''
