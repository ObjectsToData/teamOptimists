    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="IN teaching courses on the law to judges, lawyers and law students, Judge Barry Schaller often makes his point by drawing not only on the literature of William Faulkner, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Mark Twain, but also on the works of contemporary writers. He says that stories in literature are more interesting and fruitful resources than the hypothetical cases that law schools usually deal with.     A graduate of Yale College and the Yale Law School, Judge Schaller was appointed to the Appellate Court in 1992, after 18 years on the Connecticut trial bench. A book he has written, ''A Vision of American Law,'' has just received the Quinnipiac Law School's award for excellence.   ">

                    <p>A. I've always been very interested in the problems of our society, and I've done some writing about violence and problems of authority in the system. I found that I didn't want it to be quite so academic as I originally planned, and I wanted it to relate to real situations that the legal system has to deal with. I hope it speaks about the law in understandable and relevant ways for people who care about these issues.</p><p>One other motivating factor for me was a belief that judges should share their experience. Judges see a great many human problems and develop a tremendous body of experience and knowledge about some of the most difficult issues in our society. Although the canons of ethics restrict the way judges can talk about past or present cases, they should be able to communicate the ideas they develop from doing this work. The use of literary stories is a very good vehicle for doing that.</p><p>Q. How might you apply the lessons learned in a particular story?</p><p>A. The best examples are Saul Bellow's ''Herzog'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man.'' In both novels, the protagonists learn from their experiences in society. In ''Herzog,'' the turning point actually occurs in a courthouse as a result of several legal proceedings that Herzog witnesses. That is followed by his arrest on a gun possession charge.</p><p>The law is also very much involved in the world in which the Invisible Man lives.</p><p>Both protagonists mature as a result of their experiences and, among other things, learn a new approach in their relationship to society. They abandon simplistic and negative approaches and adopt realistic, principled approaches that have at their center personal responsibility for their own lives. Drawing from these literary experiences, I shaped an approach to decision making that I tested by applying it to several Supreme Court cases.</p><p>Q. Is what you've taught in law and literature courses similar to what Yale is doing with the Humanities in Medicine series?</p><p>A. As a matter of fact, I'm giving one of those programs at the medical school next March about law, medicine and morality in the context of the humanities. The series is similar because it draws different disciplines together in a realistic way. I think that disciplines always inform each other in a way we don't recognize sometimes. I'm going to talk about some of the major biomedical cases like the Cruzan case, the Quinlan case and the Baby K case. I'm interested in how judges and lawyers come to know something about the medical issues and whether they truly understand them.</p><p>Q. Are others using literature to illustrate the law?</p><p>A. I would say that almost every major law school has a course using law and literature. Interdisciplinary work has become more common.</p><p>Q. How literary are judges?</p><p>A. They're quite well educated for the most part, although some have had a technical rather than a humanities background. They perhaps must be introduced to literature more persuasively than others.</p><p>Q. Isn't it really that a literary person is wiser, more perceptive, and therefore thinks more clearly about any issues?</p><p>A. One is looking for a deeper understanding of issues, language and human situations. If the judge develops empathy and compassion by reading stories of certain types of people or certain situations, that compassion cannot dictate the decisions. But the judge will probably understand the consequences to people a little better. My feeling is that will produce a better result.</p><p>There are other uses of literature;  story telling can be very useful in understanding courtroom testimony and in writing legal opinions.</p><p>Q. Have you ever invoked a literary example rather than a legal precedent in court?</p><p>A. The judge's focus has to be on the accuracy and thoroughness of the decision, not in trying to look more educated or more cultured. Once in a while, one might go outside the law for a quote if it's directly pertinent. I often think of literary examples, but I don't bring them up because to do that might seem to detract from the seriousness.</p><p>Q. You wrote that law is a dominant force in American society, in part because of the absence of other systems of moral and ethical value. But isn't religion making a comeback? Does it conflict with law?</p>                </div>
