A passionate collector and scholar of art and antiquities, Mr. Fleischman's interest and generous philanthropy have had a profound and lasting impact on cultural institutions in New York, in the nation, and abroad.

More than a great dealer in American Art, he was a leader in his profession, serving as a director of ADAA. His interests, activities and contributions ranged across the entire spectrum of the arts and humanities, as a connoisseur, collector, lecturer, advisor, founder, board member and patron of many arts institutions. A dynamic, forthright, generous, warm and caring human being, he gave us wise counsel and set a standard of excellence which brought honor to him, his family and his profession. Our deepest sympathy and condolences to his wife Barbara, to their children Rebecca, Arthur and Martha, and to their grandchildren. James N. Goodman, Pres. Gilbert S. Edelson, Admin. V.P.    FLEISCHMAN-Lawrence A. The Friends and Patrons of the Arts of the Vatican Museums record with deep regret the death of its founding member, the architect of its major successes in acquisition and conservation, and a dear personal friend.

The Trustees, Director and staff of the British Museum, London, express sincere condolences to Mrs. Barbara Fleischman and her family on the death of Mr. Lawrence Fleischman, Chairman of the American Friends of the British Museum.

FLEISCHMAN - Lawrence A., Chairman of Kennedy Galleries Inc. New York, died on January 31 in London. He is survived by his wife, Barbara; his three children Rebecca, Arthur, Martha, and grandchild Jennifer. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at a future date.
