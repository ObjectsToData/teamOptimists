                    <p>When asked about his disappointments as chairman, Mr. Hackney said: ''The political situation changed, and I had to spend more time than I wanted telling the public and Congress what we do. I could have spent that time on programs.''</p><p>The change in the political situation that Mr. Hackney spoke of was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, when many opponents of Federal spending for the arts and humanities were elected to the House and Senate.</p><p>Spending for the humanities endowment has fallen from a high of $172 million in 1993 to $110 million in the current budget. President Clinton has asked for $136 million for next year, but Congress is unlikely to approve that much.</p><p>''Despite the turbulence of the times,'' Mr. Hackney said, ''I feel very good. We've accomplished a lot.''</p><p>Besides keeping the endowment alive, Mr. Hackney said, his accomplishments include making the endowment nonpolitical and nonideological, reversing a pattern that he said took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.</p><p>Asked to provide a defense for continuing the endowment, Mr. Hackney said: ''The only legitimate argument against continuing it is from someone who believes in minimalist government, that government shouldn't be in culture at all. The endowment does things that no one else would do but need to be done if we are to remember who we are and what the heritage of our nation is.</p><p>''One of the purposes of government is to create good citizens. That's what we do at the N.E.H. We are a democratizing force in American culture.''</p><p>Representative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois, an advocate of both endowments who was chairman of the House committee that approved their financing when the Democrats were in the majority, said he thought Mr. Hackney had succeeded in removing the endowment from partisan politics.</p><p>''We'll miss him,'' Mr. Yates said. ''I think he's been very good. He's been a very good administrator of the humanities endowment at a difficult time with less money.''</p><p>Representative Ralph Regula, Republican of Ohio, who is chairman of the appropriations panel Mr. Yates once led, said of Mr. Hackney, ''I think he's worked hard at giving the N.E.H. good leadership, especially in the field of libraries.''</p><p>Asked whether Mr. Hackney had kept politics and ideology out of the endowment, Representative Regula said, ''He has been very successful in that regard.'' He added, however, that he thought Mr. Hackney's Republican predecessors had also kept partisanship out.</p><p>A Republican critic of the endowment, Representative John T. Doolittle, a Californian, said it spent money on unneeded programs, money that could be better used ''to save Medicare from bankruptcy and balance the budget.''</p><p>''If there were ever a Federal agency or program that deserves a trip to the chopping block, it is this sandbox for the cultural elite,'' Mr. Doolittle said.</p><p>Mr. Regula did not agree with his Republican colleague. ''I think it will survive in some form or another,'' he said. ''I think the preservation of the culture of society is important.''</p><p>Mr. Hackney said the endowment had supported many good projects without getting much credit for it, like providing some of the money for public television programs on Theodore Roosevelt and the American West.</p><p>''The public doesn't normally notice who is funding projects,'' he said. ''People say: 'Oh, my goodness. Did you do that?' ''</p><p>Mr. Hackney, an Alabamian, said that at Penn he would return to one his great interests by teaching a course on the history of the South.</p><p>When he was named chairman of the endowment, Mr. Hackney was succeeded by Judith S. Rodin as university president.</p><p>''I'm going to teach history and stay out of her way,'' Mr. Hackney said.</p><p>Photo: Sheldon Hackney, departing chairman of the humanities endowment.
