                    <p>Eventually she became a sales representative for Columbia University Press. It was a fortunate job, she said, because it added to the store of knowledge and experience she felt  was necessary to start a business of her own.</p><p>''My territory extended from Maine to Atlanta,'' she said. ''I was always on the road, selling bookstores Columbia University Press books. In the course of my travels I got to know my competitors, who were sales reps from Princeton University Press, Yale and University of California Press, doing the same thing.''</p><p>Next came another marvelous learning opportunity, Ms. Barile said, when she was named manager of the Gotham Book Mart in Manhattan. The shop ''is a New York literary institution,'' she said. ''A shop that carries new, used, out-of-print and small press titles -- books of every sort. It's probably the best used bookstore in the world, and I decided then that I would have my own store one day.''</p><p>But several things happened first.</p><p>To raise money to finance her business, Ms. Barile wrote a book, ''The Bookworm's Big Apple'' (Columbia University Press), a guide to the bookstores of Manhattan.</p><p>''The city is home to more than 300 booksellers,'' she said. But because they're neither centrally located nor endowed with advertising money, many of them go virtually unnoticed. I interviewed booksellers in person. And the book lists all types of bookstores from antiquarian to specialty and everything in between.''</p><p>In November 1995, using savings and the proceeds from her book, Ms. Barile began her wholesale book business in an early-1900's building, a former munitions factory on the Croton River, near her home in Croton-on-Hudson.</p><p>''It's a lovely location, accessed by way of a bridge,'' she said. ''Our win- dows look right out on the water. In season, it's thick with fishermen fishing in the Croton Watershed. Basically, what I do is buy skids of books known in the trade as 'hurt books'  because they all have some cosmetic imperfection like a dented cover. I'm able to buy them at a very low cost, from the finest literary publishers and university presses, then, in turn, I wholesale the books to better bookstores across the country and overseas to booksellers in London. I started with 5,000 books. Now I have an inventory of 12,000, which includes  university press books on all subjects within the humanities and social sciences. Our art books are exceptional.''</p><p>About a year ago, Ms. Barile decided to convert a third of her space into a retail bookstore.</p><p>''Books at Croton River is a full-fledged bookstore,'' she said. ''We're open on Saturdays 11 to 6 and Sundays 12 to 4, and we've already expanded our retail space, and we intend to expand our hours to include Fridays. We carry children's books, academic and antiquarian books as well as new books at less than half the retail price. 'Hurt books' with a cover price of $40 sell for $15. What we don't carry are sidelines. We are strictly a bookstore.''</p><p>In less than a year an astonishing number of people have become customers at the bookstore, which is considered off the beaten track, Ms. Barile said.</p><p>''However, this is a very literate part of the country,'' she said. ''We have professors from Vassar and Sarah Lawrence and law students from Yale as steady customers, and we also have a strong following from Heritage Hills in Somers, as well as people from all parts of Westchester and Connecticut who drop by regularly. Our repeat business is over 75 percent.''</p><p>At customers' requests, Ms. Barile will also search for out-of-print and hard-to-find books at no extra cost. ''We add books to our stock every week, and we also buy books,'' she said. ''We even import books from London.''</p><p>The store closes two weekends a year, when Ms. Barile and her husband, John Gaffney, go on a book-buying trip. In mid-June, the couple go to London for a week for the book fairs there.</p><p>''The antiquarian book fairs in London are especially fine,'' Ms. Barile said. ''But we have something for everyone. Our children's books, for instance, are great, with the average cost being $5, and thanks to my husband, who works in the industry, we have a good selection of film books. However, we don't carry the kind of books you'd find in a superstore.''</p><p>Although she regrets the thinning of the ranks of independent booksellers, Ms. Barile said she believes those who have carved out a niche for themselves will survive. ''Last week my accountant told me I'm in the black and doing well,'' she said. ''This will never be a 'get rich' business, but I love what I'm doing and I feel I'm doing it well. I look around at the shop, and I know every book on the shelves was put there by me, and I find that very satisfying.''</p><p>Photos: Customers browsing at Books at Croton River, which has academic and antiquarian books; Susan Barile, owner of Books at Croton River in Croton Falls, which sells children's, academic and antiquarian books.
