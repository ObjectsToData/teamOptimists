The trip -- along the coast of South America, the Falkland Islands, Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands), Canton and Penang -- would  bring renown and prosperity to its captain, crew and owner.     Danger was ever present, in the forms of bad weather, pirates and international conflicts. Five men were lost at sea. The bicentennial of ''The Voyage of the Neptune, 1796-1799,'' as celebrated by the New Haven Colony Historical Society, is marked by an exhibition based on four first-hand accounts written by members of the crew. The show, sponsored in part by the Connecticut Humanities Council and the Woman's Seamen's Friend Society of Connecticut, features recorded passages from the diaries. On display are period paintings and engravings, maps and atlases, luxury goods brought back from Asia and dozens of period artifacts.   ">

Five men were lost at sea. The bicentennial of ''The Voyage of the Neptune, 1796-1799,'' as celebrated by the New Haven Colony Historical Society, is marked by an exhibition based on four first-hand accounts written by members of the crew. The show, sponsored in part by the Connecticut Humanities Council and the Woman's Seamen's Friend Society of Connecticut, features recorded passages from the diaries. On display are period paintings and engravings, maps and atlases, luxury goods brought back from Asia and dozens of period artifacts.</p><p>''It was rare to circumnavigate the world in that day,'' said Amy L. Trout, the exhibition's curator and designer who spent more than a year on the research alone. ''It needed a good ship, good crew and an experienced captain.''</p><p>It was indeed a fine vessel, a 350-ton, full-rigged sailing ship built at New Haven's Olive Street shipyard and armed with 20 carriage guns. Its 30-year-old captain, Daniel Greene -- his likeness is displayed in an oil painting and a miniature -- had been to China before.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The crew of 36 included experienced sailors and raw hands, whites and blacks, carpenters, cooks, stewards, cabin boys and Dr. David Forbes, age 21, who set bones, made salves and herbal teas and, in his diary, complained frequently of being sick.</p><p>Ms. Trout explained that most New Haven ships were built for the coastal trade or the West Indies. But Ebenezer Townsend, the local merchant who commissioned the Neptune, had more ambitious plans. His ship was to hunt seals in South America, trade the skins -- which were much prized in China -- for porcelain, silk and tea, then sell the merchandise in the United States.</p><p>During the early 1790's, Ms. Trout said, New England merchants broke into the sealskin trade with China, a market that had previously monopolized by Russians and western Europeans. ''I like sealing well,'' wrote Dr. Forbes, who joined the captain and the rest of the crew in the endeavor. As the ship moved from island to island in search of rookeries,  more than 80,000 seals were taken during the two-year hunt, their skins packed in the cargo hold until there was no more room.</p><p>En route to China, the Neptune made a stop in the Sandwich Islands. By that time, the lack of fresh fruit was beginning to take a toll on the men's health.</p><p>''A number began to complain of the scurvy at that time, which increased, and on our arrival at Owyhee several were black to their hips with it,'' reads the diary of Ebenezer Townsend Jr., the supercargo, or business manager. ''We were fearful of losing some, but they got well astonishingly almost immediately on our arrival. We are now all in good health.''</p><p>The son of the Neptune's owner reported of Hawaii that ''the lands are in the highest state of cultivation, everything of luxurious growth . . . you see here the bread fruit, coconut, plantain, sweet potato, taro, yams, bananas.''</p><p>Food was not the only delight Hawaii offered. ''At 6 P.M. at night there came . . . several canoes with girls,'' John Hurlbut, the mate, wrote in his diary. There were also reports of ''Sandwich Island girl disease.''</p><p>An engraving by the British artist John Webber, who had sailed with Captain Cook in the 1770's, shows Hawaiian canoes meeting a ship, just as the American logs describe it.</p><p>Canton was the next and most important stop, the only Chinese port open to Westerners. Their trade was welcome, but as ''foreign devils'' they were restricted to the waterfront area and not allowed in the city itself.</p><p>An oil painting done in 1795 shows warehouses, wharves and buildings flying the stars and stripes, the Union Jack and other Western flags, while sailing ships lie at anchor in the bay.</p><p>The Neptune did exceptionally well in Canton. The seal skins fetched $3.25 each, for a total of $280,000 -- a vast sum in 1798. With these earnings, the crew bought bolts of silk and nankeen, a sturdy cotton cloth to be made into knee britches; thousands of crates of tea, the most popular beverage back home, and porcelain dinnerware, both for sale and for personal use.</p><p>Several pieces of elegant white china rimmed in blue and gold are featured in the exhibition, part of a dinner set commissioned by a member of the Townsend family. A lacquered dressing table, 2 1/2 feet high with oval mirror, was brought back by John Hurlbut for his financee and bears her name. It is considered the earliest piece of China trade furniture in New England.</p><p>Although most of the day at sea was devoted to keeping the ship in good order, viewers will note that there was also time for comradeship and relaxation. Musical instruments on display -- fife, drum and violin -- evoke the frolics described in several diaries. One was held with a group of Patagonian Indians who wanted to trade fresh meat for American liquor and biscuits. Another was a ball held in honor of a visiting captain in the Falkland Islands.</p><p>Other pastimes illustrated in the display are games like cards, dice and checkers, and books, which were read aloud, either for entertainment or teaching, particularly navigation.</p><p>The exhibition will be on view through June 29 at the New Haven Colony Historical Society, 114 Whitney Avenue, New Haven. Hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and 2 to 5 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Admission is $2, $1.50 for older people and students and $1 for children age 6 to 16.</p><p>On March 15, from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. the society will present ''The Neptune Symposium: New Englanders in China and the Pacific,'' with scholars discussing 18th-century seafaring, exploration, decorative arts and the China trade. Admission  is $5 for society members, $10 for non-members with reservations and $15 for people paying at the door.</p><p>Photos: Capt. Daniel Greene of New Haven, far left, was 30 when he took the Neptune around the world. The ship's mate, John Hurlbut of Wethersfield, got the lady's dressing box, left, in China and the ship's doctor, 21-year-old David Forbes, kept a diary, below right, that is still legible today; This 18th-century woodcut serves as logo for the exhibition at the New Haven Colony Historical Society.  </p>                </div>
