    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="IF you're an assistant professor of French history hoping to make tenure at your university, achieving your goal these days may not be as simple as it used to be. One of the most important criteria in tenure decisions is the candidate's publishing record. While journal articles are fine, a book (perhaps derived from your doctoral dissertation on, say, Oratorian education and the origin of French revolutionary ideology) would be even better. Preferably, it would be published by a leading university press -- a shining badge of scholarly merit.    Unfortunately, times have never been so tough for publishers of scholarly monographs on French history, among other once-standard areas of research in the humanities. Twenty years ago, an assistant professor's monograph might have been expected to sell as many as 1,500 copies. Since its publisher might have broken even at 1,100 copies, everyone was satisfied. Today, an author in the same position would be lucky to sell 800 copies, but the publisher's break-even point remains about the same.  ">

One of the most important criteria in tenure decisions is the candidate's publishing record.

Unfortunately, times have never been so tough for publishers of scholarly monographs on French history, among other once-standard areas of research in the humanities. Twenty years ago, an assistant professor's monograph might have been expected to sell as many as 1,500 copies. Since its publisher might have broken even at 1,100 copies, everyone was satisfied.

Twenty years ago, an assistant professor's monograph might have been expected to sell as many as 1,500 copies. Since its publisher might have broken even at 1,100 copies, everyone was satisfied. Today, an author in the same position would be lucky to sell 800 copies, but the publisher's break-even point remains about the same.</p><p>So that monograph may never be published. Thus you may not win tenure, the tenure committee may not even be sure how to make such decisions, and students as well as other scholars may lose access to the knowledge the book would have shared.</p><p>The face of scholarly publishing is changing in ways that may affect universities for years to come. Money has become scarcer, not just for the presses but also, perhaps more alarmingly, for libraries, once the academic presses' most dependable customers. Some presses are hoping that the new superstores like Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders will pick up the slack, but while the chains are ordering lots of scholarly books, it remains to be seen whether they can sell them. Beyond these immediate concerns, there are worries about how electronic publishing will affect its paper-based progenitor.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Which of these factors are most important? The directors of New Jersey's two major academic presses -- Walter H. Lippincott of Princeton University Press, which releases 200 titles a year with a staff of 95, and Marlie Wasserman of Rutgers University Press, whose staff of just 20 produces 140 books a year -- have divergent views.</p><p>For Ms. Wasserman, the big question is the effect of superstores. ''Our part of New Jersey is loaded with the kind of superstores where I love to spend an afternoon sipping coffee and looking at books,'' she said, ''though I lament the loss of so many of the mom-and-pop stores at the same time.</p><p>''But as these superstores proliferate, they need to line their shelves. What's new is that we've never had so many linear feet of shelf space to fill. In a sense, these books are being used as wallpaper. There's no evidence that any more of them are being bought. Instead, we've been seeing record returns.''</p><p>Returns have always been the thorn in book publishers' side. Under longstanding tradition, booksellers who cannot sell what they order have the right to return them to the publisher for a full refund. The practice is specific to the book business; as Ms. Wasserman points out, ''Macy's can't return a blouse they haven't sold.'' And while publishers have always grumbled about this system, the escalating rates of returns from the superstores have them more worried than ever.</p><p>One result is that ''we do the opposite of what people might think,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ''We try not to sell too aggressively. We want to try to have an order that realistically reflects what they can sell. Sometimes authors call and want to know why they didn't see their book on the shelves. Seeing that makes the author feel good, but we like to see our books in someone's hand at the cash register.''</p><p>At Princeton, Mr. Lippincott is far more sanguine about the effect of the superstores. ''So far they've been a big help,'' he says. Returns of Princeton's books increased by 12 percent last year, he acknowledged, but net sales increased by 9 percent, so ''it's not something we're nervous about.''</p><p>To him, the fundamental problem is the precipitous decline in the purchasing power of libraries -- a problem that some publishers had hoped expanded sales at superstores would solve. ''We used to be able to sell 800 to 900 copies of each of our books to research libraries worldwide,'' Mr. Lippincott said. ''Now, that figure is down to 300. That's just not enough to sustain the publication of a monograph. With only a few exceptions, even the most brilliant book in French history is unlikely to sell more than 500 copies.''</p><p>Ms. Wasserman, too, is concerned. She estimates that 20 years ago, libraries accounted for half the sales of a typical Rutgers publication, but now the average would be closer to 5 percent. ''It's an enormous change,'' she says, ''and it's not going to get better, with the lack of funding to libraries and the growth of interlibrary loans.''</p><p>But Rutgers's strategy involves developing a certain independence from the institutional market, which is why the consequences of the superstores' spread worry her so much more than Mr. Lippincott.</p><p>Catching the Eye Of the Browser</p>                </div>
