Mills, which the Board of Regents will discuss at their meeting tomorrow and vote on sometime this fall, is part of the state's efforts to raise graduation standards. Last year, the state began requiring all students to pass a battery of college-preparatory Regents examinations to graduate and said that it would phase out the easier competency tests now required.</p><p>''There should be a core of courses, a common core of study required of all students,'' Mr. Mills said in an interview yesterday. ''In addition, students should have an in-depth knowledge of something.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Supporters of the proposal include some of the city's alternative high schools, which already have curricula built around particular themes and require related internships.</p><p>The proposal also helps address the concerns of business leaders seeking high school graduates with workplace skills. Some education experts agreed with the Commissioner that such specialization will encourage students to learn to study a subject in depth, not just gloss over it.</p><p>But others were more critical. They worried whether smaller schools could offer many choices in majors and whether New York City schools, where many teachers are considered ill-prepared in the subjects they teach, could offer adequate programs.</p><p>''It would mean that more attention would have to be paid to teachers teaching in the field for which they received a degree,'' said Kathy Christie, an analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a group based in Denver that monitors state education policy. ''If they're teaching math, they better have a degree in math.''</p><p>In the past, some educators and parents have resisted the idea of forcing students to choose an area of concentration at age 14 or 15, which they say is too early to limit educational options. State officials maintain that the broad range of required core courses will expose all students to an academically rigorous liberal arts education.  Under Mr. Mills's plan, most students would be expected to make their choice at the end of their sophomore year.</p><p>The new requirements could also extend the time it takes many students to graduate; in New York City, for instance, half of the high school students last year took more than four years to graduate. Because of crowding and teacher shortages in New York City, some large high schools cannot offer a wide array of electives, such as foreign languages, or do not offer them every year.</p><p>New York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew was on vacation yesterday and could not be reached for comment. His spokeswoman, Karen Crowe, said school officials would need more details before commenting on Mr. Mills's recommendation.</p><p>State officials could not immediately say what portion of the state's 800,000 high school students would see their schedules radically altered under the proposal. But for most of New York City's 300,000 high school students, the proposed requirement would force them to alter their schedules by choosing a set of electives in an area of specialization. About two-thirds of the 20.5 credits required for a diploma are already determined: four years each of English and social studies, two of math, science and physical education, and a semester of health. (Unlike with college, one high school credit represents a yearlong course.)</p><p>Mr. Mills has also recommended that students be required to take 22 to 24 credits for graduation.</p><p>For a health major, for instance, a student at Bushwick High School in Brooklyn could do an internship at an area hospital and take a course in anatomy at a community college, as well as biology and health courses offered at the high school.</p><p>But for many college-bound students, the proposal would have little practical effect. A student aiming for M.I.T., for example, now ordinarily takes four or five units of math, and several Advanced Placement science courses. Under the new proposal, he could take the same classes and declare himself an engineering major. Other college-bound students might not see much change because they already take enough courses to qualify as a major in, say, English or the humanities.</p><p>In addition, thousands of students in New York City attend specialized high schools that focus on a particular field of study, like the performing arts, law or health.</p><p>The proposal is part of Mr. Mills's  initiative to spell out the state's tougher high school graduation requirements, which are being phased in over the next several years, starting with the class of 2000. All high school students will have to pass five Regents exams -- in English, math, American history, global studies and science. But Mr. Mills has proposed creating several tiers of diplomas.</p><p>As a temporary safety net for the state's most vulnerable students, the Commissioner has proposed that special education students be granted a diploma if they pass the competency tests, but fail the Regents exams. The state will evaluate how well the students perform on the Regents exams and will decide whether to continue offering them a regular diploma. The most severely disabled students will still be allowed to graduate with what is called an Individual Education Program diploma.</p><p>Those who score above 85 on eight Regents exams will earn a Regents diploma with honors, while those who earn high marks in their area of concentration will be awarded a Regents diploma ''with distinction.''</p><p>State officials said most students have the time to concentrate on a particular field of study. Most high-achieving students in the state already take up to seven classes a year. And Mr. Mills said that while he recognized that the tougher graduation requirements would be difficult for many students, he did not believe they would lead students to drop out.</p><p>The Chancellor of the Board of Regents, Carl T. Hayden, said yesterday that his colleagues supported the thrust of Mr. Mills's recommendations, but that many details would have to be ironed out -- such as what would constitute an area of concentration -- before the board votes on a package of proposals on new graduation standards in September. Included in that package will be a contentious proposal made by the Commissioner earlier this year to translate Regents exams into languages other than English.</p><p>''I think it's safe to assume he has a good deal of conceptual support,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''There may be disagreement of particular parts of this.''</p><p>Heather Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education, which has helped establish 23 alternative high schools across the city, praised the proposal for allowing students to choose their area of concentration. Most students at the Center's schools are required to perform community service and integrate that experience into their classwork.</p><p>''What we want is for the state to set the standards, to specify the core general areas of learning that students should be proficient in,'' she said. ''And also, we support the concept of having more flexibility and more student choice driving what students do.''</p>                </div>
