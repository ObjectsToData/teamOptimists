Presumably, the elimination of the agency would inspire the same reaction.</p><p>Even with Senate and White House support, the agency is not completely out of the political woods. By reducing the N.E.A. subsidy to zero, House opponents of the agency have enhanced their bargaining position with the Senate. That could mean that even if the agency survived, it could still face deep cuts.</p><p>These votes on the future of Federal support for the arts and another on limiting road-building subsidies for logging companies raised fears among some House members today that the entire Interior Department spending bill, which includes the arts endowment, will become hostage to disgruntled factions.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Republican conservatives also tried today to eliminate the National Endowment for the Humanities. But that effort appeared to fall short when it was ruled that an amendment to strip that agency of its $96.1 million subsidy failed on a voice vote.</p><p>The House recessed after that vote and scheduled a recorded vote on the issue for next Tuesday, when it also expects to complete work on the $13 billion Interior Department bill.</p><p>The White House has already said that President Clinton's senior advisers have urged him to veto the bill if it pares the Federal subsidy of the arts or eliminates the agency. Moreover, the efforts by House Republicans to kill the N.E.A. has run into stiff opposition from some top Republicans in the Senate.</p><p>Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who is the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that sets spending for the agency, is already on the record as saying he supports continuing the current $99.5 million Federal subsidy for next year.</p><p>Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said on Thursday that he would introduce legislation soon to reauthorize the arts agency.</p><p>Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, also threw his support behind the N.E.A. today, saying the Senate should insist on continuing the full subsidy for the agency.</p><p>Mr. Warner's views are important because he is chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. In the House, opponents of the arts endowment used the Rules Committee to block a straight vote on whether the arts agency should survive or not.</p><p>To receive a Government appropriation, Congress must vote to authorize the spending as well as appropriate the money. Often, the authorization vote fails to take place on schedule. That was the case with the N.E.A., which made it vulnerable to the action taken this week. It has not been authorized since 1993, and House opponents used that technicality on Thursday to kill the agency and today to deny it any money.</p><p>The procedural measure that the House had approved on Thursday would have cut all but $10 million of the agency's current $99.5 million Federal subsidy. The $10 million would go toward shutdown costs.</p><p>The windup to the debate in the House today over the endowments produced passionate speeches from both sides of the issue, a rare floor speech by Speaker Newt Gingrich and an odd circumstance in which warring Republican moderates and conservatives joined forces to defeat the block-grant compromise that Mr. Gingrich had championed.</p><p>''We are not going to give the money to aging hippies anymore to desecrate the crucifix or do other strange things,'' said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. He was alluding to a controversial N.E.A. grant in 1989 to Andrew Serrano, whose work included a photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine.</p><p>Mr. Hunter was one of a number of Republicans who support an amendment offered by Representative Vernon J. Ehlers, a Michigan Republican, to replace the arts agency with a block-grant program.</p><p>The Republican leadership had aggressively pushed Mr. Ehlers's proposal on Thursday as a compromise to head off a floor fight between moderates and conservatives. Under his plan, the agency would be replaced by $80 million in block grants, nearly $30 million of which would go to state art commissions and $48 million to local school boards. The remaining money would be for administrative costs.</p><p>''I know of no one, in 30 years in the arts, that has been assisted by the N.E.A.,'' said Representative Sonny Bono, a California Republican who spent three decades in Hollywood as a singer and actor before his election to Congress in 1994. ''I don't see where the N.E.A. is this amazing contributor to mankind and has brought all these artists forward.''</p><p>Mr. Gingrich was the last to speak on the issue, imploring House members to support ''a new approach and a new way of funding the arts at a Federal level.''</p><p>But in the end the block-grant amendment was rejected, 271 to 155.</p><p>Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized the plan as ''nothing but a device by which you accomplish the assassination of the National Endowment for the Arts.''</p><p>An overwhelming majority of the Democrats, 195, agreed, along with the lone independent in the House. Seventy-five Republicans of every political stripe, including Mr. Bono, voted against the block-grant amendment. Six Democrats joined 149 Republicans on the losing side.</p><p>The Interior Department appropriation bill provides money for national parks, museums, wildlife refuges and some programs for American Indians. The arts endowment is one of the smallest accounts, but as Mr. Ehlers noted today: ''The N.E.A. has proved to be a lightning rod. It has attracted all types of criticism because they have on occasion given money for art which is profane or obscene or sacrilegious.''</p><p>Both endowments -- for the arts and for the humanities -- were established in the early 1960's and quickly raised the anger of conservatives.</p><p>When the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 1995, the endowments were one of their first targets. But, thwarted by Republican moderates who threaten an all-out fight, opponents had to settle for cutting the subsidy of each endowment by 40 percent, and bided their time.</p><p>The arts agency became a prime target again this year after Mr. Gingrich and the Republicans suffered through a series of stumbles and retreats on budget issues.</p><p>During the debate over the last several days, opponent after opponent accused the agency of financing pornography and of perpetuating an elitism in the arts. Others complained that most of the N.E.A. grants were disproportionately distributed to major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p><p>''It's a good-old-boy network, and it's time to terminate that,'' Representative Philip M. Crane, Republican of Illinois, said on Thursday.</p>                </div>
