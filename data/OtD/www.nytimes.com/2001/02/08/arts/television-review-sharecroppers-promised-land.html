    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="A jaunty newsreel from the 1940's describes a mechanical ''robot'' that could pick as much cotton in an hour as a family could pick in a day. The commentator suggests, enthusiastically, that perhaps sharecropper families could move to Chicago and work for International Harvester, the manufacturer whose invention had destroyed their livelihood. The farm family staring grimly at the camera does not seem to find the prospects ahead quite so cheerful.    The newsreel appears in ''Goin' to Chicago,'' a documentary tonight on PBS that tells the story of more than five million Southern blacks who headed North between 1940 and 1970. That was the second wave of migration. The first wave took place from 1915 to 1925 and was motivated by racial segregation, vote deprivation, terrible poverty and crop-destroying boll weevils. The catalyst for the second was the automatic cotton picker. It virtually nullified the sharecropper system that kept the descendants of slaves in a state of semislavery --  though it also deprived them of a living.  ">

That was the second wave of migration. The first wave took place from 1915 to 1925 and was motivated by racial segregation, vote deprivation, terrible poverty and crop-destroying boll weevils. The catalyst for the second was the automatic cotton picker. It virtually nullified the sharecropper system that kept the descendants of slaves in a state of semislavery --  though it also deprived them of a living.</p><p>For many, relocation would prove fruitful and then frustrating. The industries that offered opportunity for a time would eventually move to where labor was cheap -- paradoxically, often to the South. The ensuing poverty and unemployment seemed a double blow, because African-Americans had looked to the North as a hopeful destination. Now grandchildren of those migrants speak wistfully of the place their families came from. ''People get hurt around here too much,'' says a boy living in Chicago's Cabrini-Green housing project.</p><p>''Goin' to Chicago'' moves briskly through this large and important piece of history, which for years had largely been ignored. There isn't time in an hour to explain fully the complex economic and social forces that stymied the transplanted Southerners and their children after a buoyant beginning. For that, Nicholas Lemann's 1991 book, ''The Promised Land,'' is an excellent resource. (His book was the basis for a five-hour series produced by BBC and Discovery Productions that appeared on the Discovery Channel in 1995.) So ''Goin' to Chicago'' isn't the first time the story has been told, or the most complete version, but it's illuminating all the same.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The documentary touches on the big themes but focuses on individual stories -- many of them told by a group of elderly people who return to Greenville, Miss., from Chicago for a reunion. These stories remind us that this may be history, but it lives. The reunion segments, which have the informal feeling of a home movie, remind us that the migration also produced optimism and accomplishment. The promised land may not have ended up flowing with milk and honey, but many people did manage to find a good life (as did many who stayed behind).</p><p>The producers rely on standard techniques like interviews and archival film. That's just fine, because the witnesses have strong stories to tell, and so do the pictures. The old people know how to use language to conjure a memory. A woman who grew up in a place called Sunflower County, Miss., gives a succinct definition of sharecropping: ''It means you work 20 years for yourself and 20 years for somebody else.'' Another woman weeps remembering how hungry she was as a child, half a century earlier. Triggering her tears are Proustian recollections -- not of sweet cakes but of skimpy meals of turnips and beans.</p><p>People moved all over the North, but this documentary focuses on Chicago, which took on mythological meaning to those who moved there. ''Chicago was the heaven that you fantasized about,'' says one man. The city offered jobs in its stockyards and manufacturing plants. It had a black newspaper, The Chicago Defender, and lots of music played by great black musicians. While Chicago's industries prospered, so did its black community, though one man admits that the good life may have been exaggerated. ''It was the kind of exaggeration people needed to maintain hope,'' he says.</p><p>The city was less welcoming when black people started to integrate neighborhoods. The documentary recalls those ugly moments with film showing hostile whites staring at their new black neighbors unloading their belongings. Old women describe how frightened they were as young girls to discover that their families' upward mobility was an affront to angry white people.</p><p>''Goin' to Chicago'' is also filled with music, another vital tributary in this particular stream of history. Eventually, the blues, reflecting one kind of misery, gave way to rap, reflecting another. But there's much more to the story than misery-like resilience, bravado, humor, and the documentary reflects that, too.</p><p>GOIN' TO CHICAGO</p><p>PBS, tonight</p><p>(Channel 13, New York, at 10)</p><p>George King, producer and director; Lou Potter, writer; Chiz Schultz, executive producer; Vertamae Grosvenor, narrator; National Endowment for the Humanities and National Endowment for the Arts, underwriters.</p><p>WITH: Recordings by musicians including Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers and James (Son) Thomas.</p>                </div>
