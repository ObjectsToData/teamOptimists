    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Declaring that the First Amendment is not absolute, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed 15 men and 5 women yesterday to a panel that would recommend decency standards for art in the majority of New York City museums.     Among the appointees was the mayor's own divorce lawyer, Raoul L. Felder, who stood with the group in front of a large oil painting of Thomas Jefferson in the City Hall Blue Room for the sometimes carnival-like announcement. Notably  missing from the group was Peter Max, the 1960's Pop artist who pleaded guilty to concealing income from the Internal Revenue Service and who apparently declined the invitation by the mayor to serve on his panel. Mr. Giuliani testily suggested that Mr. Max had been scared off by the news media.  ">

Giuliani appointed 15 men and 5 women yesterday to a panel that would recommend decency standards for art in the majority of New York City museums.     Among the appointees was the mayor's own divorce lawyer, Raoul L. Felder, who stood with the group in front of a large oil painting of Thomas Jefferson in the City Hall Blue Room for the sometimes carnival-like announcement. Notably  missing from the group was Peter Max, the 1960's Pop artist who pleaded guilty to concealing income from the Internal Revenue Service and who apparently declined the invitation by the mayor to serve on his panel.

Notably  missing from the group was Peter Max, the 1960's Pop artist who pleaded guilty to concealing income from the Internal Revenue Service and who apparently declined the invitation by the mayor to serve on his panel. Mr. Giuliani testily suggested that Mr. Max had been scared off by the news media.</p><p>''There were people, and I won't mention names, who told us that 'we would love to do it, but our agent told us this would hurt business, this would be very difficult,' '' Mr. Giuliani said to reporters. He added that ''you literally have intimidated people from doing this, who wanted to do it, because they're too afraid of what you're going to write about them.''  Mr. Max did not return phone calls to his office yesterday.</p><p>Mr. Giuliani, who voiced outrage in February over a photograph at the Brooklyn Museum of Art of a nude woman in Christ's place at the Last Supper, has promised since then that he would appoint a panel to set what he has called ''decency standards'' for art in museums that receive any city money, which includes most museums in the five boroughs. But yesterday Mr. Giuliani abandoned the word ''decency,'' saying that reporters were trying to demean his commission by using it to describe the  panel.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I can't control what you call it,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''If you want to call it a decency panel, good. If you want to call it an indecency panel, I don't know, maybe you're more comfortable with that.''</p><p>Officially the panel is a reconstituted Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, a mayor-appointed body that has been dormant for three years. A new subcommittee of the commission, composed of about 10 members, would specifically address the question, the mayor said, of  ''whether or not there should be a different assessment made when public dollars are being used than when private dollars are being used'' for art in city museums.</p><p>The chairman of the subcommittee is Leonard Garment, a former Nixon administration official who in the early 1990's was co-chairman of an independent Congressional commission to review procedures for grants at the National Endowment for the Arts. Mr. Garment said yesterday that critics of the mayor's panel needed to ''calm down.''</p><p>Mr. Garment also said that ''paintings are not going to be torn down off the walls'' and that ''there's nothing for people to get agitated about.'' Mr. Garment, who lives in Washington but is working on a new jazz museum for Harlem, described himself as a former adversary of the mayor from his seven years as a lawyer for Marc Rich, the commodities broker accused of evading $48 million in taxes and trading oil with Iran. Mr. Giuliani brought the case against Mr. Rich when he was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr. Garment said yesterday that he and the mayor have ''aged into a kind of comfortable state of acquaintanceship.''</p><p>Of the 20 members of the commission, three are artists: Constance  Del Vecchio Maltese, an illustrator and portrait painter who is married to State Senator Serphin R. Maltese, the chairman of the Queens County Republican Committee and a founder of the state Conservative Party; John Howard Sanden, a painter who specializes in portraits of chief executives of major companies and who is now at work on a portrait of Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup; and Diana Kan, a Chinese-American traditionalist landscape painter.</p><p>The chairman of the commission is Lawrence Herbert, the chief executive of Pantone, which develops graphics for the fashion industry. Mr. Herbert said that he first learned that he was chairman yesterday morning. ''After I dropped my cup of coffee, I had to change my shoes,'' he said. He also said he hoped to make recommendations to the mayor within two to three months, but ''the first thing we have to do is do the right thing.'' Mr. Giuliani will leave office at the end of this year.</p><p>The members of the Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission are:</p><p>Martin Bergman, freelance investigative reporter and news producer</p><p>Bartle Bull, lawyer , Jones Hirsch Connors Bull; former publisher, The Village Voice</p><p>Roderick R.
