    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="SOME of Tchaikovsky's most important orchestral music pulled ahead in the popular vote, even when it lost out in the court of contemporary critical opinion. The last three of his six symphonies, as well as the concertos for violin and for piano, the 1812 and ''Romeo and Juliet'' Overtures, and ballet scores -- ''Swan Lake,'' ''Sleeping Beauty'' and ''The Nutcracker'' -- are beloved standards that turn up even on pops programs. If this level of success were a baseball batting average, it would be a record.    Undervalued by critics, Tchaikovsky is in excellent company. While he never drew the amount of vitriol spewed at Wagner and Schoenberg, the disgust provoked by premieres of certain works places him up near Stravinsky, and ahead of his other countrymen Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff. Yet their music has gone through ups and downs in popular favor, and their average of hits, if you will, does not approach his.  ">

If this level of success were a baseball batting average, it would be a record.</p><p>Undervalued by critics, Tchaikovsky is in excellent company. While he never drew the amount of vitriol spewed at Wagner and Schoenberg, the disgust provoked by premieres of certain works places him up near Stravinsky, and ahead of his other countrymen Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff. Yet their music has gone through ups and downs in popular favor, and their average of hits, if you will, does not approach his.</p><p>In contrast to Wagner, who knew he was great and could brush off adverse opinion, or to Schoenberg, who would not renounce his hated 12-tone system and return to the plush world of his ''Verklarte Nacht,'' Tchaikovsky was thin-skinned. Public attacks -- such as when the venerated Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick wrote that the Violin Concerto was ''music that stinks to the ear,'' after Leopold Auer, to whom it was dedicated, refused to perform it -- caused the sensitive composer to agonize and torment himself.</p><p>The distance between Tchaikovsky's classics and near-misses, and between his professional productivity and personal miseries, is being explored in ''The Meanings of Tchaikovsky,'' the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra's three-week winter festival that began last Wednesday and continues through Jan. 28.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Under the direction of Zdenek Macal, and with the assistance of the festival consultant Joseph Horowitz, the annual January event, focusing on a single composer, is being expanded each year. This year's 17 programs include a symposium, a film (Ken Russell's ''The Music Lovers''), introductory talks, choral and chamber music, and educational outreach, all of which augment three weeks of all-Tchaikovsky concerts on the orchestra's regular subscription series. Events are in more locales, and among the new sponsors is the New Jersey Council on the Humanities.</p><p>The subject of ''Tchaikovsky Up Close,'' Wednesday's opening event at the Newark Museum, was chamber music -- not unusual in itself, but an all-Tchaikovsky chamber music program is almost unique. Heard together, ''Valze Scherzo,'' ''Meditation'' and the large-scale A Minor Piano Trio, all from the time the composer was around 40, reveal him as an essential symphonist who made chamber music by paring things down rather than creating within the form.</p><p>The first two pieces, performed with rich tone by the orchestra's violinist Yulia Ziskel and pianist Pedja Muzijevic (both recent Juilliard graduates), had the visceral intensity of the violin concerto, with the piano as an orchestra substitute. The 45-minute trio, in which Mr. Muzijevic was joined by the orchestra's concertmaster, Eric Wyrick, and Jonathan Spitz, principal cello, had marvelous melodies evoking snowy Russian sadness but was weighed down by lengthy heroic gestures that didn't fit the small form.</p><p>Mr. Horowitz gave an overview of the festival's focus, which aside from the music is to show Tchaikovsky's connection with literary sources, namely Dante, Shakespeare, Byron and Goethe. Works to be heard were inspired by ''Hamlet,'' ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ''Manfred'' and ''Francesca da Rimini.'' Expressing his love for Tchaikovsky's music, Mr. Macal said: ''Some people think it's too much sentiment. I don't care.''</p><p>New this year is the involvement of 55 Columbia High School students. They have been studying ''Romeo and Juliet,'' and will attend the symposium at the Rutgers University Newark campus, as well as a subscription performance that includes a duet from an opera Tchaikovsky was planning at the time of his death.</p><p>One of the surprises of Mozart, whom Tchaikovsky idolized, is that his soaring lyricism and elegant order bear no trace of the composer's chronic problems with money and health, nor suggest that he would rather have married his sister-in-law. Tchaikovsky, on the other hand, was conscious of either infusing his work with personal problems, or avoiding doing so. To some extent his homosexuality was a demon, inducing him to enter a sham marriage that plagued him for years.</p><p>Until recently, the prevailing wisdom was that far from dying of cholera in 1893, the 53-year-old composer had committed suicide to avert publicity about his sexual activities. But recent research, beginning with ''Tchaikovsky's Last Days,'' one of several books by Alexander Poznansky, (Clarendon/Oxford, 1996), uses newly available documents to show that being gay was no particular detriment to the wide acceptance of Tchaikovsky's compositions and the general outpouring of grief at his death. (The czar paid his funeral expenses.)</p><p>The concert repeated today, preceded by a Shakespeare talk, begins with the unusual ''Hamlet'' Fantasy Overture. The violin concerto, paired with the rarely heard ''Manfred'' Symphony, is to be performed Thursday through Sunday with Gil Shaham, and if the audience and critics love it, Hanslick will be none the wiser. For those who want to hear the sacred choral music in Princeton, Friday's repeat of this performance is out of the question. Those listeners can attend the violin concerto concert on a different day.</p><p>TCHAIKOVSKY FESTIVAL</p><p>State Theater, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick.</p><p>Today at 3 p.m.; (732) 246-7469.</p><p>John Harms Center for the Arts, 30 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood.</p><p>Thursday at 8 p.m.; (201) 567-3600.</p><p>New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark.</p><p>Friday at 8 p.m.; (888) 466-5722.</p><p>Count Basie Theater, 99 Monmouth Street, Red Bank.</p><p>Saturday at 8 p.m.; (732) 842-9000.</p><p>Photos: Zdenek Macal says he loves Tchaikovsky's music.
