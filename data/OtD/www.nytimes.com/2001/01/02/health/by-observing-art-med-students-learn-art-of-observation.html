                    <p>''How can you tell?''</p><p>''His arm is curved like it's resting on something.''</p><p>''Good,'' Dr. Meiselas said. ''Just testing to see if you know your functional anatomy.''</p><p>The students laughed and moved on. It was clear they had no idea they had been staring at a milestone self-portrait of Rembrandt, painted in 1658 when he was bankrupt. But what counted in this recent afternoon at the Frick was noticing and interpreting visual cues in the human face and body, a skill often undervalued in an age of technology and managed care.</p><p>''We have a very indirect goal -- to make doctors better observers,'' said Amy Herman, the Frick director of education and a creator of the pilot program called ''The Art of Observation: Weill Cornell Medical College and the Frick Collection.''</p><p>''Already I've had students tell me that when they walk into a hospital room they don't go right for the chart,'' she said.</p><p>Ms. Herman's proposal for the experimental course had immediate appeal at Cornell, where Debra Gillers, the associate dean, had already begun organizing discussions with writers, actors and missionaries to improve understanding of illness and suffering. The first presentation of the humanities and medicine program, in January 1999, was a special performance of ''Wit,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning play whose heroine is dying of cancer. Other programs in the series have included the author William Styron and his wife, Rose, talking about the effects of his depression on their family.</p><p>By the time Cornell offered three, two-hour sessions at the Frick for a limited enrollment of eight, more than 30 students applied even though no credit was offered. Now, based on participants' enthusiasm and their gains in analytical skills, Ms. Herman said, it looks as if ''The Art of Observation'' will be offered again in the spring and may become a regular course.</p><p>''Even in non-H.M.O. environments, students see that speed and efficiency are what's prized,'' Ms. Gillers said. She added that the Frick course and other programs in the humanities and medicine series were all part of a movement to ''re-emphasize the human aspects'' of medicine.</p><p>The Cornell-Frick art class was modeled after one at Yale, where Linda Friedlaender, the class's co-creator, was inspired by the perfunctory treatment of a friend scheduled for surgery. In a telephone interview, Ms. Friedlaender, who is curator of education at the Yale Center for British Art, recalled visiting her friend in the hospital the day before her operation. It was obvious the woman was extremely nervous and needed some reassurance. Yet when a resident stopped by to check on the patient, Ms. Friedlaender said, he barely lifted his eyes from the chart, remained standing in the doorway, and took her lack of questions as permission to quickly leave.</p><p>''I went home and talked to my husband, who's also a physician here, and I said, 'You know, that resident really missed the boat. If he'd bothered to notice, he could've seen she was very upset and at least tried to open the door to some questions to get her to talk about it,' '' Ms. Friedlaender said.</p><p>Three years later, the Yale course, called ''A Rash in a Frame: Enhancing Observational Skills,'' is required for all first-year medical students. They come to her museum in small groups and always study the same Victorian narrative pictures, which were chosen for their wealth of detail. Afterward, the students return to the medical school and compare a set of X-rays or slides taken from the same patient, looking for subtle changes.</p><p>Word of the course has spread and resonated, Ms. Friedlaender said, adding that she has received calls from medical schools and museums across the country interested in starting similar programs. Yale's nursing school, for one, has followed suit.</p><p>Until her recent retirement, the art historian Mary G. Winkler also led medical students through a visual arts curriculum at the Institutes for the Medical Humanities at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. The exercise honed the young doctors' observational skills, she said, and served as ''another avenue for arriving at some sort of sympathy or empathy.''</p><p>At the Frick, the Cornell students analyzed juxtaposed Hans Holbein portraits of Sir Thomas More, the Catholic martyr, and Lord Thomas Cromwell, his Anglican executioner, without recognizing those ill-fated servants of Henry VIII. Still, they concluded that the vividly colored More was a whole lot more sympathetic than Cromwell, whose beady eyes made him look scheming.</p><p>They also compared portraits of two notable women of Georgian England, trying to determine why the windblown Lady Hamilton, the mistress of Admiral Nelson, looked more seductive than the elaborately coiffed Lady Peel, who was the wife of Sir Robert Peel, who twice served as prime minister. Certainly the small spaniel cuddled against Lady Hamilton's chest didn't hurt, with the pointy markings on its head oddly emphasizing her exposed cleavage.</p><p>''Maybe they were bred for that purpose,'' quipped Daniel Goldin, a student.</p><p>His partner in the class, Elena Wechsler, suggested that Lady Hamilton's eyes were much larger than Lady Peel's and her pupils seemed more dilated.</p><p>''Belladonna!'' gasped Ms. Herman, recalling that European women once used the potentially fatal herb to dilate their pupils in the belief they would look more attractive.</p><p>''That's sympathetic enervation,'' said Dr. Charles L. Bardes, another professor in the group who has been practicing general medicine and teaching at Cornell for the last 11 years. He went on to explain how the sympathetic nervous system responds to fear or arousal, including enlarging the pupils, which, in this case, he continued, added another erotic quality to the portrait.</p><p>After looking at paintings, the students returned to a Frick conference room to view color photos of Cornell patients and guess what they could about the subjects' health and happiness. Their own youth and lack of experience were apparent as they struggled to divine the meaning of drooping eyelids, uneven skin tone, collagen-deprived lips and even the red stain in a grinning teenager's dark hair (the perfectly healthy girl was photographed soon after Halloween, when she had used some dye).</p><p>Finally, in a stunning moment of humanity over hubris, Dr. Bardes described each person for the group. Almost all were his patients, and it was clear he knew them well: This 85-year-old man's only son was murdered. That young-looking woman of 72 loved jaunts to Atlantic City. This man, ''a sweetheart, very kind-hearted,'' was orphaned as a boy. That woman was only 60 and in the advanced stages of cervical cancer, though her eyes were shining and she looked remarkably satisfied.</p><p>''She has six daughters and her big goal was walking down the aisle with the last one, which she had just done a couple of weeks before this picture was taken,'' Dr. Bardes said. ''Maybe that's what she was thinking of.''</p><p>Photos: Using a Titian portrait at the Frick as a diagnostic tool, Eric Gordon, a fourth-year medical student, recently offered observations.; Elena Wechsler, a medical student, pointed out diagnostic clues in a patient's photos to Adam Libow, a first-year student, and to Debra Gillers, an associate dean at Cornell.  </p>                </div>
