What do you want us to do?' '' said Mr. White, who wrote a dreamlike roman a clef based on the institute, in Greenwich Village. ''I would say, 'Just exist,' and that would totally confuse them.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Today such intellectual glory days are viewed with nostalgia. The institute's annual budget is less than a sixth of the half a million dollars that financed the institute after it was founded in 1976. A bitter internal feud in 1996 caused a major rift among the members. Meanwhile, many of its current and former members lament that the 120-member institute, a part of New York University, has devolved into a weekly lunch club for a coterie of mostly aging professors, nothing like the hot intellectual forum it once was.</p><p>So the institute is trying to resuscitate itself. A. Richard Turner, a retired art history professor and a former director of the institute, is heading a search committee for a new director that members hope will lead a comeback. Interviews have begun and a director could be chosen within a month, he said. ''What is going to be asked is to give an assessment of where the institute has been and on that basis, where do you think it ought to go,'' he said.</p><p>Just where the institute ought to go is precisely the problem.</p><p>Ann Douglas, a cultural historian at Columbia University and a former member, suggested that the institute needed new blood. Ms. Douglas, who was last at a Friday lunch in the mid-1990's, said: ''It felt very polite, which seemed to me a shame. If there is such a thing as a New York intellectual, the very definition is a fighter and a quarreler. I didn't see young scholars who were willing to take on and even tear down the older scholars. That's the life of the mind.''</p><p>Louis Menand, a staff writer at the New Yorker who left the institute in 1996 because he was unhappy with the way it was being run, cautioned against overreaching, however. Even five years ago, he said, it was difficult to get a big turnout because of competition from other intellectual events. Mr. Menand said that the institute should continue to do what it does best, bringing together academics and nonacademics. ''I think it was successful as along as it had a modest goal of bringing people together without any particular pressure,'' he said.</p><p>William Taylor, a cultural historian who was acting director of the institute for one year a decade ago, agrees that times have changed. ''There are a lot more places where scholars and writers can go, and in some ways you can say it's an achievement of the institute,'' he said. ''It's a pathfinder.''</p><p>Indeed, the organization -- whose list of recent guest speakers includes Breyten Breytenbach, the expatriate South African writer; Jessica Yu, a documentary filmmaker; Daniel Pipes, a specialist on Arab affairs; and the novelist Michael Cunningham -- was among the first generation of humanities institutes in the nation. Being in New York, it was by far the most visible, and it was distinctive in its mix of academics and nonacademics.</p><p>''It was a pretty innovative idea,'' said Leslie Berlowitz, executive officer for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Mass., and a former N.Y.U. vice president. ''They really sought to bring together public intellectuals and academics around issues of common interest. That kind of impulse became more and more pervasive.''</p><p>Some organizations, including the New York Public Library's Center for Scholars and Writers, the Center for the Humanities at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, and the International Center for Advanced Studies at N.Y.U., were inspired at least in part by the institute.</p><p>The institute's relationship with N.Y.U. complicates the process of redefinition. Although the university provides an operating budget of about $80,000 and three offices (much of the money came from foundations in the early days), the institute has always had an oddball relationship with the university. Members, particularly the nonacademic ones, have been skittish about any attempt by N.Y.U. to get involved in their affairs. That was the subtext of commotion in 1996 that began with an invitation to Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak at the Friday lunch. The dispute left the institute on the verge of self-destruction.</p><p>Tony Judt, the director at the time, told the associate director, Jocelyn Carlson Baltzell, in a fax from Paris that he had asked the university to dismiss her from that post for insubordination because she tried to help arrange the speech. (Mrs. Clinton did not speak.) But their relationship already had deteriorated over Mr. Judt's plan to consolidate the administration of the institute with that of the university's Remarque Institute, which focuses on European studies.</p><p>Mr. Judt, a professor of European studies and a former dean, saw his plan as cost-efficient at a time of tightening budgets. But some members said the move would make the institute more academic and less a hybrid. A few members quit in protest over Ms. Baltzell's dismissal. Mr. Judt resigned.</p><p>The bitter feelings, members agree, have dissipated in the four years that the institute has been under the stewardship of the now-departing director, Leonard Barkan, an affable scholar of Renaissance arts and literature. Members say the 1996 upheaval was more of a symptom than the cause of the institute's malaise.</p><p>Ms. Baltzell, who helped create a virtual clone of the institute at the University of Southern California, said the answer to the New York institute's midlife crisis might be to go online. ''It would be a form of outreach,'' she said. ''Since all of these little institutes have a problem, the charge of exclusivity and elitism, it rather immortalizes the conversations.''</p><p>Yet even Mr. Turner, who is heading the director search and would like to see the institute sponsor more events like conferences and seminars, wonders whether the institute could meet ambitious new goals. ''It's ever harder to do that,'' he said. ''Everybody is so damned busy and life is so speeded up.''</p><p>Photos: Jorge Luis Borges, one of the big names who lectured at the New York Institute for the Humanities in its heyday.
