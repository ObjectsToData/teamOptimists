SCHNEIDER-Helen (nee Bauman). We mourn the passing of Helen Schneider, who for more than 30 years worked alongside her husband, Irving Schneider, a trustee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and a former chairman of the LIJ Medical Center, to deliver the highest quality of medical care to children. A life member of Long Island Jewish Hospital's Service Guild, Mrs. Schneider became an in-service volunteer in the pediatric playroom. It was her great love for children that inspired her two daughters, Lynn Joseph and Mindy Lesser, to follow in her footsteps and eventually brought about the naming of the Schneider Children's Hospital. A pivotal force in commissioning the celebrated works of art surrounding the Children's Hospital, Mrs. Schneider will also be remembered for her dedication to the building of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel in Petach Tikvah near Tel Aviv. It is the only tertiary care facility for children in Israel serving the medical needs of children in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Mr. and Mrs. Schneider were true partners in everything they did as a family and on behalf of the hospital. They endowed many of the Medical Center's research and education programs, establishing fellowships in several areas including hematology/oncology, radiology, psychiatry and pulmonary medicine and pediatric cardiology. In addition to her generosity to Schneider Children's Hosptial, Mrs. Schneider also served on the boards of the LIJ Service Guild and the Ronald McDonald House of Long Island, which is located on the LIJ campus. She is survived by her husband of more than 50 years and their three daughters, Bunny Mayersohn, Lynn and Mindy, and grandchildren. Her lifelong commitment to the health and well being of the world's children will never be forgotten-and is her rich legacy. Roy J. Zuckerberg Chairman, Board of Trustees John S.T.

The faculty and staff of the Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, NY, mourn the loss of Helen Schneider. Her philanthropic endeavors both in this country and abroad were legendary and the hallmark of her life. With grace, style, determination and courage, she devoted herself to the welfare of children around the world. She contributed her talent, time and energy to the Schneider Children's Hospital both in New Hyde Park and in Israel in order to create a climate of comfort, solace and kindness assuring that children who enter the hospital, which bears her name, would not be traumatized by the experience. Helen carefully selected and commissioned the magnificent works of art and sculpture that adorn the Children's Hospital and stand as testimony to her sense of aesthetics, taste and deep commitment to the welfare of all children. Together with her husband, she played a vital role in the vision and the establishment of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, one of the most outstanding children's hospitals in the world; a beacon of hope for all children of the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin. It was Helen's fervent desire that the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel would be a bridge to peace between Israel and its neighbors. She, together with her husband, was the recipient of numerous citations from the State of Israel, international organizations and universities. We extend our sympathies to her husband Irving, her daughters Bunny, Lynn and Mindy, her sons-in-law and her grandchildren.

SCHNEIDER-Helen (nee Bauman). We mourn the passing of Helen Schneider, who for more than 30 years worked alongside her husband, Irving Schneider, a trustee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and a former chairman of the LIJ Medical Center, to deliver the highest quality of medical care to children. A life member of Long Island Jewish Hospital's Service Guild, Mrs. Schneider became an in-service volunteer in the pediatric playroom. It was her great love for children that inspired her two daughters, Lynn Joseph and Mindy Lesser, to follow in her footsteps and eventually brought about the naming of the Schneider Children's Hospital. A pivotal force in commissioning the celebrated works of art surrounding the Children's Hospital, Mrs. Schneider will also be remembered for her dedication to the building of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel in Petach Tikvah near Tel Aviv. It is the only tertiary care facility for children in Israel serving the medical needs of children in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Mr. and Mrs. Schneider were true partners in everything they did as a family and on behalf of the hospital. They endowed many of the Medical Center's research and education programs, establishing fellowships in several areas including hematology/oncology, radiology, psychiatry and pulmonary medicine and pediatric cardiology. In addition to her generosity to Schneider Children's Hosptial, Mrs. Schneider also served on the boards of the LIJ Service Guild and the Ronald McDonald House of Long Island, which is located on the LIJ campus. She is survived by her husband of more than 50 years and their three daughters, Bunny Mayersohn, Lynn and Mindy, and grandchildren. Her lifelong commitment to the health and well being of the world's children will never be forgotten-and is her rich legacy. Roy J. Zuckerberg Chairman, Board of Trustees John S.T.

Her philanthropic endeavors both in this country and abroad were legendary and the hallmark of her life. With grace, style, determination and courage, she devoted herself to the welfare of children around the world. She contributed her talent, time and energy to the Schneider Children's Hospital both in New Hyde Park and in Israel in order to create a climate of comfort, solace and kindness assuring that children who enter the hospital, which bears her name, would not be traumatized by the experience. Helen carefully selected and commissioned the magnificent works of art and sculpture that adorn the Children's Hospital and stand as testimony to her sense of aesthetics, taste and deep commitment to the welfare of all children. Together with her husband, she played a vital role in the vision and the establishment of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, one of the most outstanding children's hospitals in the world; a beacon of hope for all children of the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin. It was Helen's fervent desire that the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel would be a bridge to peace between Israel and its neighbors.

We extend our sympathies to her husband Irving, her daughters Bunny, Lynn and Mindy, her sons-in-law and her grandchildren.

                    SCHNEIDER-Helen. The faculty and staff of the Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, NY, mourn the loss of Helen Schneider. Her philanthropic endeavors both in this country and abroad were legendary and the hallmark of her life. With grace, style, determination and courage, she devoted herself to the welfare of children around the world. She contributed her talent, time and energy to the Schneider Children's Hospital both in New Hyde Park and in Israel in order to create a climate of comfort, solace and kindness assuring that children who enter the hospital, which bears her name, would not be traumatized by the experience. Helen carefully selected and commissioned the magnificent works of art and sculpture that adorn the Children's Hospital and stand as testimony to her sense of aesthetics, taste and deep commitment to the welfare of all children. Together with her husband, she played a vital role in the vision and the establishment of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, one of the most outstanding children's hospitals in the world; a beacon of hope for all children of the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin. It was Helen's fervent desire that the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel would be a bridge to peace between Israel and its neighbors. She, together with her husband, was the recipient of numerous citations from the State of Israel, international organizations and universities. We extend our sympathies to her husband Irving, her daughters Bunny, Lynn and Mindy, her sons-in-law and her grandchildren.

SCHNEIDER-Helen (nee Bauman). We mourn the passing of Helen Schneider, who for more than 30 years worked alongside her husband, Irving Schneider, a trustee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and a former chairman of the LIJ Medical Center, to deliver the highest quality of medical care to children. A life member of Long Island Jewish Hospital's Service Guild, Mrs. Schneider became an in-service volunteer in the pediatric playroom. It was her great love for children that inspired her two daughters, Lynn Joseph and Mindy Lesser, to follow in her footsteps and eventually brought about the naming of the Schneider Children's Hospital. A pivotal force in commissioning the celebrated works of art surrounding the Children's Hospital, Mrs. Schneider will also be remembered for her dedication to the building of the Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel in Petach Tikvah near Tel Aviv. It is the only tertiary care facility for children in Israel serving the medical needs of children in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Mr. and Mrs. Schneider were true partners in everything they did as a family and on behalf of the hospital. They endowed many of the Medical Center's research and education programs, establishing fellowships in several areas including hematology/oncology, radiology, psychiatry and pulmonary medicine and pediatric cardiology. In addition to her generosity to Schneider Children's Hosptial, Mrs. Schneider also served on the boards of the LIJ Service Guild and the Ronald McDonald House of Long Island, which is located on the LIJ campus. She is survived by her husband of more than 50 years and their three daughters, Bunny Mayersohn, Lynn and Mindy, and grandchildren. Her lifelong commitment to the health and well being of the world's children will never be forgotten-and is her rich legacy. Roy J. Zuckerberg Chairman, Board of Trustees John S.T.
