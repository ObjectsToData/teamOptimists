    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, like the rest of us, has probably never given much thought to ''public intellectuals.''  But if he did, it is a sure bet he wouldn't invite busloads over for a barbecue.    One must descend into the inner sanctum of the academy, where professors often despair of popular culture and then line up to get on television talk shows to critique it, to find the self-anointed. ''I have always taken the role of public intellectual very, very seriously,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, 51, a professor of media ecology at New York University. ''A public intellectual is someone who engages in intellectual pursuits, airs intellectual concerns in a way the broad, literate public can understand. The tradition thrives in Europe, but the American public does not have the same expectation of its intellectuals. I want to, as a public intellectual, take a fresh look at the news that we take in daily from TV, news that is astonishingly empty and distorts reality.''  ">

''I have always taken the role of public intellectual very, very seriously,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, 51, a professor of media ecology at New York University. ''A public intellectual is someone who engages in intellectual pursuits, airs intellectual concerns in a way the broad, literate public can understand. The tradition thrives in Europe, but the American public does not have the same expectation of its intellectuals.

''But one night the title popped into my head.'' He collected a catalog of President Bush's funnier gaffes. But, he said, as he started to read through the transcripts of the debates and news conferences, which make up much of the book, he found that it wasn't just the president who was the problem. It was the news media.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''The rituals of television help shape our political experience,'' he said. ''The heavy visual bias, the severe time constraints, the constant sense of salesmanship are among the factors that prevent us from understanding key issues such as the disappearance of the middle class, the enormous increase in corporate power and the complexities of race relations.''</p><p>Professor Miller has a doctorate in English from Johns Hopkins University but is not a tweedy academic slumped over dusty volumes and whiling away his afternoons in the faculty club lounge. He plays the electric guitar. He is looking for a rock band to join. He is on his third marriage. He wears jeans. He has a 3-month-old baby with his new wife and lives in Greenwich Village. He has a 20-year-old son by a first marriage. He has ''a special cat'' named Spooky.</p><p>IN his old position as a teacher at Johns Hopkins he taught a popular course on film.  He loves ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Godfather, Part II,'' and ''Barry Lyndon.'' He had a half-hour spot on ''The Lisa Simeone Show'' when the radio host was at a public radio station in Baltimore for seven years. He talked about political and media issues. He would like to find another radio slot.</p><p>''I really loved doing that,'' he said. ''This is another example of what public intellectuals should do. Many academics are incapable of speaking to a public audience. I would love to have a talk show or do good television drama.''</p><p>He wars against the ''transnational corporations'' that control us.  He rails against academia, especially the humanities, for being out of touch. He speaks breathlessly about his ''moral imperatives'' after arriving to his office a half-hour late. He says there are only a few real, honest, authentic voices out there to be heard. And he chafes that he, and other public intellectuals, are shut out of the mainstream.</p><p>''One of the reasons I reproduce such long exchanges with journalists such as Chris Matthews and Bill O'Reilly is to show their unthinking complicity in putting him across,'' he said, speaking of President Bush. ''Jim Lehrer, Sam Donaldson, Cokie Roberts especially, may find this book as painful as Bush will. It shows them violating the basic rules of journalism.''</p><p>But for all his vitriol his battle is not against TV, just bad TV, of which he says there is far too much.  And he is a believer, unlike other media critics, that it is not the medium that restricts the content but the corporate powers that control the media.</p><p>''The pressures of commercialism have made worthwhile television amazingly rare,'' he said. ''Aesthetically, TV can be as powerful as cinema. 'The Sopranos' have proved this. 'The Sopranos' is a fitting postmodern sequel to 'The Godfather.' The sky's the limit when it comes to drama and documentary. My quarrel is not with television as a medium but TV as we know it. And what is wrong with TV is what is wrong, in varying degrees, with all other media.</p><p>''There are televisual newspapers, televisual book publishing and movies that are indistinguishable from rock videos. My focus is not television, in the end, but the dead hand of hypercommercialism, that inordinate corporate pressure that drives everyone to improve the bottom line.'' After all, he argues, the great writers and artists of the past have found their modern equivalent in celluloid and video. ''I would class Stanley Kubrick with James Joyce,'' he said.</p><p>Photo: MARK CRISPIN MILLER (Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times)</p>                </div>
