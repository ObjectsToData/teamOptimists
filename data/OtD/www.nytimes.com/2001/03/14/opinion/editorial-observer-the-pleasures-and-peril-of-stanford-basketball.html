In those days, university buildings were on fire, not the basketball team. Anyone who suggested that Stanford could beat U.C.L.A. was probably stoned.    My only visit to the basketball arena came on registration day, when the gym was temporarily turned into an administrative center and I handed over $525 in tuition payments for the coming quarter, a sum that seems about as outlandish today as the fact that Stanford is favored to be one of the final four teams playing for the N.C.A.A. title in Minneapolis later this month.

Anyone who suggested that Stanford could beat U.C.L.A. was probably stoned.</p><p>My only visit to the basketball arena came on registration day, when the gym was temporarily turned into an administrative center and I handed over $525 in tuition payments for the coming quarter, a sum that seems about as outlandish today as the fact that Stanford is favored to be one of the final four teams playing for the N.C.A.A. title in Minneapolis later this month.</p><p>Of course, Silicon Valley didn't exist then, either. But the rise of a high-technology center on Stanford's doorstep seemed less improbable than the appearance of a basketball powerhouse on campus. Two Stanford graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, had created the nucleus for Silicon Valley by founding Hewlett-Packard in 1938. The Stanford School of Engineering was well respected by the time I arrived in 1966, as were many of the university's science and humanities programs. But Stanford was not exactly filling the National Basketball Association with superstars. The last time Stanford had won the N.C.A.A. title was 1942. That is still true today.</p><p>Perhaps that's why I am having trouble adjusting to the new world of Stanford basketball. I find it disorienting and slightly disquieting.</p>                </div>

                    <p>My colleagues, even my family, might find that hard to believe. I impulsively handed over $150 to the ESPN Zone at Times Square not long ago so my son and my nephew and I could see a Stanford game that was not televised by conventional means in New York. I was driven to this costly step when a friend with a satellite dish couldn't get the game and another friend who once worked at CBS Sports couldn't slip us into the network broadcast center on 57th Street to see a feed. For the expense, we got to view the game on a small monitor without sound, the pathetic compromise I negotiated with the rest of the crowd that had gathered that afternoon in the so-called sky box to watch the N.F.L. playoffs.</p><p>But underneath this dedicated rooting I feel some unease. Part of it stems from what could be called the Stanford syndrome -- the feeling that the football and men's basketball teams are not hardened warriors and that seemingly insurmountable Stanford leads can suddenly evaporate in the final minutes of games against perennial powers.</p><p>That fear is belied to some extent by Stanford's winning tradition in sports like tennis, swimming, baseball, volleyball, water polo, cross-country, gymnastics and golf. The university's women's teams are exceptional.</p><p>But the history of the football and men's basketball programs include so many heartbreaking losses it is sometimes hard to believe that victory won't slip away. This fatalistic attitude is not limited to alumni. Most sports writers look at Stanford's two most visible teams and doubt they can win the big games. The writers are not always right -- Stanford upset Ohio State and Michigan in successive Rose Bowls in the early 1970's and has defeated its archrival, the University of California at Berkeley, in their last six gridiron showdowns. Stanford won the Pacific 10 basketball title this year and last. But the doubts linger.</p><p>Another reason for concern might be described as the danger of rising expectations. Successful teams can be an ornament for Stanford, and a source of pride and national attention. But they should never supplant the university's reputation as a center of scholarship and research. Over time, the expectation that Stanford ought to play in the Rose Bowl on a regular basis or contend every year for the national basketball championship would place an emphasis on athletic success that is bound to collide with the school's academic standards.</p><p>That is not to suggest that talented athletes can't perform at a high level academically. Many can, and Stanford, in comparison with other schools, gets more than its share of these students. Stanford has an enviable 100 percent graduation rate in its men's basketball program, higher than most other Division I colleges. The national average is below 50 percent. But the risk of diluting academic and admissions standards is real.</p><p>So as I await the tipoff of the first-round game tomorrow between Stanford and North Carolina-Greensboro -- if necessary, back at the ESPN Zone -- I'll be anxious to see if Jarron and Jason Collins, the towering twins who anchor the squad's powerful inside game, will provide the scoring and rebounding punch that helped give Stanford a regular-season record of 28 victories and 2 defeats. I'll be waiting to see if Casey Jacobsen, a fluid outside shooter and exceptional all-around scorer, can hit a barrage of three-pointers. Equally important, the team must play tenacious defense, the decisive factor in many of its victories.</p><p>I might as well confess I've already booked a flight to Minneapolis.</p><p>But I would not be devastated by a loss. I'll save that sorrow for the day when students stop going to Stanford to get an education and start coming to win an N.C.A.A. crown.</p>                </div>
