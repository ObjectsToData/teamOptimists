''Staten Island? You must be kidding.'' As if the only thing out there was the Fresh Kills landfill and now that it has closed, the borough has nothing left to redeem it.    Which couldn't be more wrong. Staten Island, a terrific place to grow up, is a wonderful place to explore -- and to some of us, it's so ''out'' it's ''in.''  There are great little museums, three centuries of American architecture, historic military sites, extensive gardens and lots of programs for children. Nature lovers can meander through 7,500 acres of lush protected parkland and along miles of uncrowded beaches, or discover wetlands that are ripe for canoeing and communing with herons and cormorants.

                    <p>Whenever I tell anyone I was born and raised in the city's so-called forgotten borough, the reaction is always the same: disbelief, sometimes tinged with a bit of disdain. ''Staten Island? You must be kidding.'' As if the only thing out there was the Fresh Kills landfill and now that it has closed, the borough has nothing left to redeem it.</p><p>Which couldn't be more wrong. Staten Island, a terrific place to grow up, is a wonderful place to explore -- and to some of us, it's so ''out'' it's ''in.''  There are great little museums, three centuries of American architecture, historic military sites, extensive gardens and lots of programs for children. Nature lovers can meander through 7,500 acres of lush protected parkland and along miles of uncrowded beaches, or discover wetlands that are ripe for canoeing and communing with herons and cormorants.</p><p>All of this is easily accessible, with or without a car, because the borough is well served by public transportation, starting with the Staten Island Ferry. Because it is surprisingly big to first-time visitors, a car can be an advantage. But with the Staten Island Railroad, many bus routes and efficient express bus service from Manhattan (all of which take the Metrocard), you will never be stranded.</p><p>Cycling around the borough is especially fun in nice weather, and both the ferry and the local trains are bike friendly. The City Department of Transportation publishes a free bike map, which can be picked up at the Staten Island Visitors Bureau in either ferry terminal. The ferry is the best way to get to Staten Island. Once a bargain at a nickel a ride, it is now absolutely free and as breezy and romantic as ever (the doughnuts and hot dogs aren't bad, either). Riding one of those big orange boats at sunset on a summer evening is like a mini-cruise and almost as restorative.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Boats leave from South Ferry in Manhattan and dock in St. George, the county seat and transportation hub, which is also home to the borough's newest landmark, the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, headquarters of the Staten Island Yankees minor league baseball team. Since the first ball was thrown out in June, the Baby Bombers have drawn huge crowds to the home games, as much for the sport -- and the rivalry with the Brooklyn Cyclones -- as for the stadium's sweeping views of New York Harbor.</p><p>Another new landmark for St. George is the National Lighthouse Museum, which will open in phases beginning next summer. Housed in what was most recently a Coast Guard base adjacent to the ferry terminal, it will explore the science and lore of lighthouses. You can already tour the site, which in the late 19th century was the United States Lighthouse Depot, the country's main center for technological development and the manufacture of lighthouses.</p><p>A Harbor for Snugs</p><p>Another proposal envisions adding a satellite of the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences along the leafy new port-side promenade. The institute, the borough's main museum, is just a three-block walk from the ferry terminal. It has a large cache of possessions, from bugs and botanicals to paintings and decorative objects, displayed in regular temporary exhibitions. You could catch a show with some surprise gem from the museum's storerooms, like a painting by the Staten Island native Jasper Cropsey, or works by Chagall, Warhol, Toulouse-Lautrec, Piranesi or D&uuml;rer.</p><p>Right now you can also see paintings from the institute in a show at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, just a 10- to 15-minute ride west along Richmond Terrace by car, bus or bike. The center is the main exhibition space at the borough's best known art and performance site, the 83-acre Snug Harbor Cultural Center. Opened 200 years ago as a haven ''for aged, decrepit and worn-out sailors'' -- or Snugs, as the retired seamen were called -- Snug Harbor is a collection of 28 buildings in the Greek Revival, Italianate and Beaux Arts styles, all of which are slowly being spruced up and given a second life in the arts.</p><p>There is an 1892 music hall that is just a year younger than Carnegie Hall and a new museum, the Noble Maritime Collection. The museum opened last November in a three-story 1844 Greek Revival structure, which was renovated almost exclusively with volunteer labor. It focuses on the work of John A. Noble, the Paris-born lithographer, painter and seaman whose favorite subject was wooden sailing vessels.</p><p>The current temporary exhibition, ''In the Shadow of Wichita Bill,'' is devoted to Noble's father, John (Wichita Bill) Noble, also an artist, who painted alongside Picasso and Lautrec in Paris and the Nabis in Brittany.</p><p>Come Into a Garden</p><p>You could spend a whole day at Snug Harbor, which offers an escape for every taste and age. If nature is what you crave, amble into the Chinese Scholar's Garden and you are instantly transported to China's Suzhou province, and maybe to another level of consciousness. The crown jewel of the Staten Island Botanical Garden, the Scholar's Garden was executed by 40 artisans from China and is the only garden of its kind in the United States. Seasonal changes in light and flora make it an oasis at any time of the year, as much in August as on a mordantly cold morning in March.</p>                </div>
