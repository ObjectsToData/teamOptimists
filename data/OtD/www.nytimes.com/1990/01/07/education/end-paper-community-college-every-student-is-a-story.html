                    <p>DESPITE the bargain-basement image and second-rate reputation of the community college - the ''K Mart of Education'' is what some people call it - its inner life is often rich and complex. In one row there may be a middle-aged professional actor, an ex-marine who studies Amish philosophy, a wife and husband who separated during the term, a young day-care worker who hugs abused children every day, a French emigrant and an intelligence officer who says he was left to die in an outpost in Vietnam because he refused to perform illegal activities.</p><p>I'm not generalizing; this is one row of my introductory humanities course this term. The rest of the class includes a young black entrepreneur who reads tax forms the way some children digest comics; a professional race-car driver, a welfare recipient, a half-dozen ''traditional'' students and a 40-year-old woman who is the only member of her family not hooked on drugs.</p><p>In my first years of teaching, classes like this overwhelmed me. During one office hour I may discuss existentialism in Sartre's ''Nausea'' with one student, and to another student in my composition class explain how adding ''ed'' to the end of a verb forms the past tense. But I've come to rely on my students. They are not empty vessels to be filled, but overflow with experience that can make classroom theory walk in flesh and bone.</p><p>While analyzing a pious article on Vietnam, a veteran turned up the voltage when relating how his unit evacuated a flooded village. ''The sergeant says people can bring only one thing with them, the boat's so jammed. This woman with a baby has a pig under her other arm. 'One thing!' the sergeant says. The woman throws the baby into the river.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Oh, no!'' a girl cried. ''What did the sergeant do?''</p><p>The vet stared hard. ''Nothing. That's the way it was there.''</p><p>During a discussion of a James Baldwin essay on racism, an older black man told of picking cotton as a boy and watching a white supervisor try to seduce his mother; a white factory worker answered with his own story of being laid off ''because of reverse discrimination - they had to keep the minorities.'' A middle-aged Italian woman told of taking her new, black boyfriend to a family wedding and ''listening to the choking sounds of dying Italian grandmothers.'' A skinhead type gritted his teeth and a young Puerto Rican woman lowered her head as they contributed their own stories. Education emerges not just through texts and theories but through sharing and shaping what's already inside students.</p><p>One 40-plus woman in that class may represent the community-college spirit as much as one person can. During an operation several years ago the woman, Deana Woods, died on the table. She told the class how she ''floated'' above the doctors and saw herself dead. ''I cursed them to revive me,'' Mrs. Woods said, ''so I could try again. Now I'm taking all my second chances.'' She enrolled in a medical-technician program, reads voraciously, wants the quickest route to a useful life. Her success both astounds her and seems perfectly natural. ''Sometimes,'' she muses. ''This life seems like a dream. I can't imagine I'm here.''</p><p>The dream doesn't come true for many. Fewer than half of all community-college students nationally earn an associate's degree, and fewer than one-fourth attain bachelor's degrees. Some critics say community colleges serve only to ''cool out'' the lower classes by offering the illusion of opportunity while ineffective remedial programs and crushing teacher loads make failure inevitable. Others argue that an open-door policy cannot be compared to colleges with restricted admissions, where success is practically guaranteed.</p><p>As Thomas DeSchaine of Grand Rapids Junior College in Michigan told a community-college conference in 1988, ''It's easy to teach at Harvard. We really have to teach. And our students have done some pretty wonderful things people would not have expected.''</p><p>One such student was Steve Leakey, who admits he was illiterate when he enrolled four years ago. ''I was Helen Keller almost,'' said Mr. Leakey, who at 27 has crawled through two years of remedial courses. ''Walden'' in my humanities course knocked him flat. ''Man, this was another language! I read this guy four times. Nothing! Then I saw what he meant. It's about being more alive.'' He studied home-building, constructed his own house on a hilltop and will soon earn his associate's degree. As part of his social-services program he interns at a mental-health clinic, where he's done wonders with some of the men. ''Hey, they understand what it means to sweat for a 'C,' '' he said. ''I can offer them something.''</p><p>Too few Steves swim all the way upstream, but community colleges are the only ones that will even let him in the water.</p><p>Most community-college students are trapped between future success and present survival. About 70 percent work full time while attending college full time. Most failures occur when a student loses a baby sitter, can't concentrate during an 8 A.M. class after a night of trick shift at the factory or because family war erupted when Mom resigned as a maid to attend college. Several of my students scrounge for returnable cans to get lunch money.</p><p>At the same time, traditional academic excellence does occur in community colleges. Nearly a quarter of their students graduated in the top 20 percent of their high school classes (compared with 38 percent of four-year college students). Among my 4,000 students were people who became an Arctic explorer, a State Senator, a Congressional candidate, a real-estate tycoon, college professors, lawyers. Many conceal their community-college educations because of stereotypes about the colleges.</p><p>Like their students, community-college teachers are stereotyped as second-rate laborers in the college hierarchy. They average 15.5 hours a week in class and 16.3 more advising or tutoring students, while four-year college professors teach only 8.2 hours and advise 11.3 hours more. Community-college professors teach the production-line introductory courses to a total of 250 to 300 students, while university professors may have as few as 75 to 100 students, as well as the freedom to develop unusual courses, frequent sabbaticals and time for creative research. ''I feel like a leper,'' one Oregon community-college professor admitted at a conference.</p><p>But there is one perk community-college teachers have. When they enter that room, it's like finding a shelf of exotic books waiting to be opened to unfold their stories.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
