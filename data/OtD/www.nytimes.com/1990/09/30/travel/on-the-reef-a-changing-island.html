Lady Elliot, the most southern of the more than 700 coral islands that comprise the 12,000-mile-long Great Barrier Reef, had been open to tourism since 1969, when a landing strip was pounded right down its middle (it's the only island on the reef to have one).">

                    <p>''You won't recognize the place,'' our Australian friend said when I told him we were going back to Lady Elliot Island. ''It might be too civilized for you now.'' My husband and I had been there in 1981, when it was the well-kept secret of a handful of Queenslanders. Lady Elliot, the most southern of the more than 700 coral islands that comprise the 12,000-mile-long Great Barrier Reef, had been open to tourism since 1969, when a landing strip was pounded right down its middle (it's the only island on the reef to have one). But it was tourism of an exceedingly primitive nature.</p><p>In 1981, we slept in a tent on the edge of the Pacific and went to bed at nightfall because electricity was weak and sporadic. We ate powdered eggs for breakfast and canned spaghetti or baked beans for the other two meals because refrigeration was scant and transporting supplies from the mainland costly. Fresh water was scarce, so we soaped, turned off the shower, and prayed it would come back on for rinsing. Still, we thought Lady Elliot paradise unspoiled and couldn't wait to go back. We finally made it for a four-day visit in August, after first touring the country with our two adult children.</p><p>It was true, we scarcely recognized it. Many changes have occurred since 1985, when the island was incorporated into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Commission and a spartan, no-frills resort, leased to private individuals, was opened.</p><p>Lady Elliot is less than a quarter of a mile in diameter, so no more than 100 or so guests can stay there at any given time. As for accommodations, there are still tents, but now also Reef Units, prefab structures housing either two or three groups of guests. These have private bathrooms and adequate hot water, good reading lights, and both double and bunk beds. Some even have a trundle under the bunks, making it possible for a family of five to sleep in not-too-crowded conditions. Our family chose to have two of the units, each of which has sliding doors opening onto a veranda, and since they face the ocean, the view is spectacular. However, maid service is weekly and that's when the bed linens and one towel per guest are changed, as all laundry must be flown to the mainland. Each unit also comes with its own broom and shovel, a gentle hint that guests should sweep out their own sand.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Getting to Lady Elliot is easy; Sunstate Airlines makes daily trips from the mainland city of Bundaberg, an hour's flight north of Brisbane, the international airport. From Bundaberg it is 50 miles and 40 minutes to the island in a plane that holds up to a dozen passengers with 22 pounds of luggage each (excess can be shipped separately).</p><p>Once there, vacationers don't lose time getting to what they came for. Lady Elliot is surrounded by crystalline water 120 feet deep in places, so divers simply walk out and drop down among coral canyons said to be the most beautiful on the entire reef. Divers, snorkelers and even swimmers are surrounded by uncountable varieties of curious fish that all seem to know they are protected because spear fishing is forbidden.</p><p>''There is something about an island which brings out the appetite in people,'' one of the cooks told me, and my family certainly proved her point. Each meal, in the dining room, features a generous array of hot and cold dishes, both meat and vegetarian. Fish legally caught beyond the reef is served frequently, and fruits and vegetables are abundant. Portions are large, second helpings encouraged, and the chef is a whiz at desserts. Breakfast is from 7:30 to 8:30 A.M., lunch from 12:30 to 1:30 and dinner from 6:30 to 7:30. Guests who want to picnic can request a hamper.</p><p>What we liked especially about mealtimes was the informality: although there is a bar, there is no formal cocktail hour and no enforced conviviality. No one dresses and no one fusses.</p><p>Until a new education center is finished, the dining room also serves for lectures, slide shows, table tennis and videos. There is a small but well-stocked natural history library, and everyone tries to contribute to the Creature Feature aquarium, which changes daily depending on what turns up on that day's low-tide reef walk, for which you must wear rubber-soled shoes to avoid coral cuts. A hat is recommended as a guard against the extremely bright sunlight. Guests are also cautioned against the occasional stinging cone fish.</p><p>The staff entertains with stories after dinner, especially those about the resident ghost said to inhabit their quarters, adjacent to the lighthouse. She is thought to be Susannah McKee, wife of a 19th-century keeper, who became so deranged by the isolation that she walked off the jetty and drowned herself. The staff also provides harrowing tales of past shipwrecks, including that of the British sailing ship for which the island was named in 1811. However, guests tend to by-pass entertainment because the reef itself encourages guests to retire early in order to rise and watch the sunrise or take advantage of prebreakfast snorkeling and diving.</p>                </div>
