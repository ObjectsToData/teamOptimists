                    <p>Ken Burns, the film maker whose epic documentary, ''The Civil War'' has been called a television masterpiece and the best American film of the year, is ''very guarded'' about how success may change his life.</p><p>''It wasn't that long ago,'' he said, ''that I was sleeping on the floor in friends' apartments and eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner.''</p><p>Now, Mr. Burns is being called the most accomplished film documentarian of his generation; ''The Civil War'' is being assigned as required viewing everywhere from high schools and colleges to the meeting rooms of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. Burns stands to realize the largest share of financial returns from sales of videocassettes and an accompanying coffee-table-size book.</p><p>''The Civil War,'' an 11-hour series that is being broadcast for five consecutive nights on public television (the second part is on tonight at 8), is the result of five years of work by Mr. Burns, an independent film maker based in New Hampshire. Although he had already made several widely praised documentaries based on American history, Mr. Burns had attained neither significant fame nor financial security.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Indeed, when he began work on ''The Civil War'' five years ago, coming off a critically celebrated biography of the Louisiana political boss Huey Long, Mr. Burns was, he said, ''flat broke.''</p><p>Mr. Burns, who is 37 years old, had consistently refused to make television commercials despite being offered up to $10,000 a day. He said he had not calculated how much the extensive marketing of the documentary series would be worth to him.</p><p>But Dan Markim, the vice president of new business for Time-Life Video, which owns direct-marketing home video rights to the series, said he expected that ''The Civil War'' would ''easily be the best-selling program of its genre - the special-interest video.''</p><p>Jon Cecil, the director of PBS Video, which owns the rights to institutional sales of videocassettes (to colleges, high schools, libraries and the like) said that even before it went on the air ''The Civil War'' was selling better than any previous educational cassette tied to a PBS program.</p><p>And Ashbel Green, senior editor of Alfred A. Knopf, which has published a companion book to the series, with Mr. Burns as co-author, said sales were already very promising. In a review in The New York Times on Sept. 5, Herbert Mitgang called the book ''the most sophisticated and masterly illustrated history of that war to come along in years.''</p><p>Mr. Burns said that the series would also be marketed to foreign broadcasters and that a videodisk edition was planned.</p><p>Financed by Grants</p><p>''The Civil War'' cost $3.5 million to make. It was financed by an assortment of corporate and foundation grants. In early 1985, Mr. Burns received initial grants of $20,000 each from public television's programming division and WETA, the PBS station in Washington. That enabled him to start work - and tide his family over.</p><p>Later that year, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting put up $165,000.</p><p>Mr. Burns then assembled a proposal that enabled him to win a $1 million grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p>He found the corporate backing he needed from the General Motors Corporation, which also donated $1 million and agreed to promote the program at the cost of another $1 million. The company also committed $600,000 for related educational materials for high schools and colleges.</p><p>Because the program eventually doubled in length, Mr. Burns had to obtain additional grants from the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation and a second grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p><p>Although Mr. Burns retains total ownership of the film, he said he was required to pay back the grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Humanities with any profits from sales of the film.</p><p>Because of that requirement, Mr. Burns said he believed that he might make his first profits quicker from book sales than from the film.</p><p>The book, also called ''The Civil War,'' was written by the program's scriptwriter, the historian Geoffery C. Ward, with Mr. Burns and his brother Ric. Mr. Green said that Knopf had printed 250,000 copies priced at $50 each. The book was also a main selection of the Book of the Month Club. Sales were brisk even before the program went on the air.</p><p>Time-Life Video 'Very Bullish'</p><p>But Mr. Markim of Time-Life Video said Mr. Burns's expectation that the book would prove more profitable than the program on videocassette might be well off the mark.</p><p>Time-Life is ''very bullish on this product,'' Mr. Markim said, but he declined to give any figures on projected sales.</p><p>Time-Life began a campaign to market ''The Civil War'' this week as the program went on the air. Mr. Markim said it would advertise on local and cable television stations and in national magazines. A tele-marketing campaign will begin later.</p><p>Time-Life will charge $199.55 for the series but will also sell each cassette on a subscription basis for $24.95, with the Knopf book as a premium accompanying the first tape.</p><p>Mr. Markim said Time-Life was not at all concerned that the market might be reduced by taping of the series off the air as it is broadcast this week. ''Most people just don't know how to use their VCR's,'' he said.</p><p>The PBS Video series has already sold 1,400 copies to schools and libraries at $350 each, and Mr. Cecil said he expected sales to pass 4,000.</p><p>PBS Video and George Mason University in Virginia are studying the feasibility of transferring the series to videodisk, Mr. Burns said, where it could be combined with a computer program to form an interactive disk.</p><p>So far, the only foreign sale has been to the BBC. ''My films have not done tremendously well overseas because I celebrate American themes,'' Mr. Burns said. But none of his previous films received anything like the recognition that has accompanied ''The Civil War.''</p><p>Film Maker's Next Project</p><p>That recognition extends to Mr. Burns as well, of course.</p><p>''We are already interested in talking to him about his next project,'' Mr. Markim said.  That project will be a documentary series for public television on the history of American baseball. He has already completed a shorter film about the great days of radio in America. And he is planning another series -profiles of distinctive Americans.</p><p>Photo: Ken Burns, whose documentary ''The Civil War'' is widely marketed. (Gary Moss/Outline for The New York Times) (pg.
