    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  The White House chief of staff today ordered the Education Department to reverse its ruling on scholarships for minority students, acting on President Bush's instructions to retreat from the decision, Administration officials said.    The action today came within hours of Mr. Bush's selection of Lamar Alexander, the former two-term Governor of Tennessee, as the new Secretary of Education. He would replace Lauro F. Cavazos, who was forced to resign last week by the White House. The selection of Mr. Alexander, one of the first governors to champion education reform more than a decade ago, was seen as an effort to revive the department and make good Mr. Bush's pledge to be the &quot;education President.&quot;  [ Man in the News, page B14. ] Debate at Meeting     In a contentious meeting in his office this afternoon, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu disagreed with officials from the White House, the Justice Department and the Education Department over how far the Administration should retreat from the ruling that scholarships designated solely for minority students were illegal.">

                    <p>Instead, Mr. Sununu said the Administration should go further and reject the foundation of the ruling. Where the Education Department said private donations should be treated in the same way as public money, Mr. Sununu ordered Federal lawyers to come up with language that would draw a legal distinction between private and public scholarship money. Mr. Sununu argued that this could be presented as something less than an outright reversal, but officials who were unhappy with his decision said it would be seen that way.</p><p>Those officials argued that accepting any form of race-exclusive spending would undermine the principles on which the Bush Administration's civil rights policies rest: that there can be no discrimination of any kind, even if that would adversely affect minority groups.</p><p>As of this evening, an Administration official said Mr. Bush had not given his approval to Mr. Sununu's approach, but the chief of staff wanted to announce a decision on Tuesday in hopes of getting Mr. Bush out of this latest political bind on civil rights as quickly as possible.</p><p>Michael L. Williams, the head of the Education Department's civil rights division, who issued the original scholarship ruling without the knowledge of the White House, scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning.</p><p>Mr. Williams decided that it was illegal for colleges and universities supported by Federal money to give scholarships that are designated solely for minority students.</p><p>Mr. Williams argued that even if the money came from private donations once it was in the possession of a university, it was, in effect, public money. Lawyers from the Education and Justice Departments, led by the White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray, agreed with that assessment. Embarrassment to Bush</p><p>Although the Administration has strongly opposed quotas or race-specific programs like the ones rejected by Mr. Williams, the ruling deeply embarrassed Mr. Bush, who learned of it only after it was reported in the press and disapproved of it. The announcement stunned the education establishment, infuriated civil rights groups and complicated Mr. Bush's already strained relationship with black voters.</p><p>Still smarting from criticism of his veto of civil rights legislation earlier this year, the President made it clear he wanted his staff to find a way to reverse the scholarship policy, while saving as much face as possible in the process, officials said.</p><p>Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, indicated Mr. Bush's position today when he said the President, who has long been a supporter of the United Negro College Fund and other efforts for minority students, was "very disturbed" by Mr. Williams's decision.</p><p>"He does believe that minority scholarships have been important for economic growth and development, for educational opportunity," Mr. Fitzwater said.</p><p>Some officials argued that the Administration could not simply reverse Mr. Williams's ruling without embarrassment and without appearing to reject Mr. Bush's stand against quotas. The President vetoed the civil rights bill largely because he believed it would lead to racial quotas in employment.</p><p>In discussions over the weekend and in Mr. Sununu's office today, one official said, some officials suggested that the White House could suspend the ruling and order a "thorough review."</p><p>"Of course, a review can go on forever, and meanwhile the old policy would be in place," the official said.</p><p>Another suggestion was that the ruling be "redefined" to say that it applied strictly to scholarships that were distributed according to an applicant's race but that scholarships intended to redress economic imbalances or past patterns of discrimination would be legal, he said.</p>                </div>
