                    <p>You're involved too many ways - better not go,'' warned my husband. His forebodings have a way of coming true, but I was determined to attend the hearing downtown at the criminal court at Foley Square.</p><p>First of all, one of my friends needed moral support. She had placed her finances in the hands of a man who'd said, ''Leave it to me and you'll never want,'' and she had been defrauded. Second, this legal encounter was marking the end of a friendship whose funeral I had to attend: the man who defrauded her was not only one of her oldest friends, he was also one of mine. The third, and perhaps strongest, reason had to do with my own judgment of character. This man, whom we had once nicknamed ''the philosopher,'' was someone on whose integrity I would have staked my life. If I didn't know him, how could I know anyone?</p><p>When I arrived at the courthouse, I found my defrauded friend sitting with half a dozen other plaintiffs, all looking grim. They had just heard that none of the stolen money would be recoverable. Though our friend had called himself their investment manager, he'd invested nothing, but had simply fed his needs with their savings. His long experience in finance had been combined with a love of the arts. ''You haven't got the temperament for business,'' he'd fondly told them. ''Let me take care of it for you.'' If his clients needed cash, he advanced a check, which he claimed drew on interest; in reality, he was depleting one person's capital to pay another.</p><p>Incredible as it seemed, over the years no one had seen a financial statement. He had used his wife's prolonged illness, and later the aftermath of her death, to account for delays. His devoted friends, all connected in one way or another with the arts and humanities, had humanely muted their claims.</p>                </div>

                    <p>During the long, dull hearings, my defrauded friend and I sat side by side while voices droned on. None of the victims were called up; instead, their letters of testimony were read into the record. ''Lifelong friendship'' and ''lean on me'' were phrases I faintly heard. In his sixth decade now, our friend held himself erect, a discipline along with others he'd imposed on himself - to be reliable, someone to be counted on. How could you do it? I asked the back of his head. He declined comment or defense at this time, his lawyer told the judge. Just before our friend quit the courtroom, his glance swept the listeners' benches. I shuddered, accused, a voyeur at his downfall.</p><p>But that night he called me at home to thank me for coming to court. I stammered that I had come on behalf of the friend who had accused him, then recoiled from my own words. How painful for him to pretend I had come for his sake! How lonely he must feel to attempt it. When he inquired after the health of my husband and children, I answered in desperation that I couldn't make small talk in the shadow of this enormity. Small talk, he said, was all he could manage now; enormity was what he confronted alone and in silence. The restraint of his answer, its honest stoicism, moved me. I cried into the telephone, ''How could you do it!'' I was remembering that his victims - all women, except for one man in frail health with an admitted tendency to nervous breakdowns - had been persuaded to turn over inherited money at their time of greatest vulnerability, the death or serious illness of a parent or spouse.</p><p>He answered gravely that there were circumstances he was not at liberty to divulge, but when the truth came out, everything would be seen in a different light. The voice was the voice of my old friend; the behavior was so evil, I could not imagine that I knew its author.</p><p>I hoped he was right, I managed to say, and found that I was longing to believe it. He added that the usual thing for people in his situation was to run away or kill themselves. ''But tomorrow I'll be back in that courtroom,'' he firmly said.</p><p>I hung up and announced to my husband that this man could not be guilty; his character was sound. The quiet answer came that my friend must understand me pretty well. ''Then why, if he's guilty,'' I demanded, ''didn't he steal from me?'' My husband said dryly that it might be because he hadn't died yet and left me my widow's mite.</p><p>At the next day's hearing my divided loyalties showed. Was there such a thing, I wondered aloud, as altruism pathology? Maybe our friend had meant to help, deluding himself as debts overwhelmed him: Just one more month, then I'll make it up to them! His victims, chance-met pilgrims on the way to catastrophe's Canterbury, weren't interested in my theory. Yet I felt I still had a relationship to the unknown man, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde - whoever. I must have enraged his victims with my belief that I might somehow find the key to his personality, as if I were trying to execute some fancy swimming feat while they were drowning.</p><p>If the victims became exasperated with me, so did I with them. I heard in a new way the question I had hurled at my accused friend: not only how could he do it, but how could they let it be done to them? If my friends had been too decent to imagine evil at work, they had also refused to recognize in their personal world what existed outside it. They had insisted, against all evidence, on their right to a charmed life.</p><p>When Abraham Lincoln said you could fool some of the people all of the time but you couldn't fool all of them all the time, he nicely combined skepticism about human capacities with faith in the ultimate triumph of good. Yet in the crucial gap of time between the first and second premises, whole worlds have collapsed.</p><p>Those defrauded were highly educated people who controlled themselves in public, showing impassive, courteous expressions in the courtroom. You had to dine with them afterward to know how rage ate at them. The day before sentencing, we went to lunch. The man prone to nervous breakdowns looked at the menu and remarked, ''I Live on $10 U day now.'' Nevertheless, we ordered wine, and someone toasted, ''Here's to 21 months,'' the maximum sentence for our friend's crimes.</p><p>Back in the courtroom the dreary-sounding mumble continued as lawyers haggled over points that would increase or diminish his time in jail. When it was over, he got something less than the maximum, and the last we heard, he had been assigned to a prison for white-collar criminals. The victims - civilized humanists all - had agreed to turn their lust for revenge over to the law. There was no way a few additional months could have quenched the fires I saw in those eyes. These were good people to whom bad things had not just ''happened'' but been deliberately done, and to whom no restitution would ever be made. They would have to live as best they could with betrayal and loss.</p><p>We are not speaking here of fatal assault; no one died. It's only money, as we glibly say. I'm not so sure. As we walked from the courthouse, my defrauded friend, her usual soft-spoken manner further subdued by exhaustion, said little except that she was thankful it was over. Only when we parted did she add, ''He murdered our lives, you know.'' Even after I carried home news of the day's outcome, I couldn't say for sure whether she meant ''murdered'' because of the money our old friend devoured, or because he had throttled the life-pulses of friendship.</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
