                    <p>Members of the council that advises the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts say they expect fireworks at a meeting here on Friday when they take up recommendations for new grants for two of the four sexually explicit performance artists who were denied grants in June.</p><p>A member of the council, Jacob Neusner, said in a telephone interview today that he was aware of support for the new grants but would oppose them. Another member, Wendy Luers, said that she intended to vote for the grant and that she believed the proponents would have greater support than they did at the last meeting, in May, because there would be more theater professionals present.</p><p>The group, whose members are Presidentially appointed, is the National Council on the Arts.</p><p>Mr. Neusner said he would also propose a rule - similar to one now governing the National Endowment for the Humanities - that would prevent the agency from supporting art deemed ''political, ideological or advocating social change.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>On Monday, John E. Frohnmayer, the chairman of the arts endowment, told an independent commission reviewing the grant-making procedures of the endowment that in the future, before approving grants, he would have to consider ''how it's going to play with the audience.''</p><p>Representative Ralph Regula, the Ohio Republican who is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee that originates the endowment's annual appropriation, applauded what seemed to be a more conservative stance by Mr. Frohnmayer. ''I wish he'd had this attitude at the beginning,'' the Congressman said in an interview today, ''and then we wouldn't have been where we are now.''</p><p>Conflict-of-Interest Rule</p><p>Mr. Neusner also said he would make an effort at the council meeting to strengthen the endowment's conflict-of-interest rule.</p><p>He said he had learned that Ellen Sebastian, a director who works with the performance artist Holly Hughes, and Jerry Hunt, a musician and composer who collaborates with the performance artist Karen Finley, had been members of the panel that last May recommended grants for Ms. Hughes and Ms. Finley as well as for themselves.</p><p>Ms. Hughes and Ms. Finley were two of those whose grants were reversed by Mr. Frohnmayer last month. The two other performance artists whose grants were denied are John Fleck and Tim Miller.</p><p>M. K. Wegmann, an associate director of the Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans, who served as chairman of the panel that made the recommendations, said, ''We strictly adhered to the endowment's conflict of interest rules.'' Those rules would require the two panelists ''to leave the room and not participate in any discussion or the voting on their grants.''</p><p>''Even if they left the room when those grants were discussed,'' Mr. Neusner said, ''it's no good. I think that's brazen and incendiary.''</p><p>Reinstatement Sought</p><p>Mr. Frohnmayer also said on Monday that he planned to ask the council to consider reinstating two grants for the Institute for Contemporary Art in Philadelphia. He said the grants had been ''inadequately discussed'' at the last council meeting.</p><p>After it was learned that the institute had organized a show of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, which was attacked as obscene by some members of Congress last summer, Congress stated in the 1990 Interior Appropriations Act that it must be notified of any future grant to the Philadelphia organization.</p><p>The three-day meeting that is to beginon Friday will be open to the public. Previous meetings of the council have been conducted in private on the theory that applicants who might be turned down deserved the protection of anonymity. But the endowment agreed on Tuesday to open its meetings after a court challenge.</p><p>The 23-member council meets quarterly to review grant recommendations proposed by various peer panels. It also meets with the chairman of the endowment to advise him ''with respect to policies, programs and procedures'' and to ''review applications for financial assistance'' and ''make recommendations thereon to the chairperson.''</p><p>Followed Council's Advice</p><p>The chairman is not bound by the council's recommendations, although from the time he took office last fall until recently Mr. Frohnmayer followed the council's lead consistently.</p><p>The head of the endowment's sister agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, frequently reverses panel recommendations, but such actions have been fairly uncommon in the arts endowment. Agency records show that in the seven years before 1989, the chairman reversed panel recommendations on only 35 of approximately 33,700 proposed grants.</p><p>These are the members of the council:</p><p>DAVID BAKER, chairman of the department of jazz at Indiana University.</p><p>PHYLLIS P. BERNEY, former member of the executive committee of the Wisconsin Arts Board.</p><p>SALLY BRAYLEY BLISS, ballerina and artistic director of the Joffrey II Dancers.</p><p>NINA BROCK, former chairman of the Tennessee Arts Commission.</p><p>PHYLLIS CURTIN, opera singer.</p><p>JOSEPH EPSTEIN, professor of English at Northwestern University and editor of The American Scholar.</p><p>HELEN FRANKENTHALER, artist.</p><p>ROBERT GARFIAS, enthnomusicologist and former Dean of Fine Arts at the University of California at Irvine.</p><p>ROY M. GOODMAN, New York State Senator.</p><p>MEL HARRIS, president of the television group of Paramount Pictures.</p><p>MARGARET HILLIS, director of the Chicago Symphony Chorus.</p><p>BOB JOHNSON, Florida State Senator.</p><p>M. RAY KINGSTON, architect and former chairman of the Utah Arts Council.</p><p>ARDIS KRAINIK, general director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago.</p><p>HARVEY LICHTENSTEIN, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p><p>Ms. LUERS, writer and lecturer.</p><p>TALBOT MacCARTHY, former chairman of the Missouri Arts Council.</p><p>ARTHUR MITCHELL, founder and artistic director of Dance Theater of Harlem.</p><p>CARLOS MOSELEY, former managing director, president and chairman of the board of the New York Philharmonic Society.</p><p>Mr. NEUSNER, former member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</p><p>LLOYD RICHARDS, director and dean of the Yale School of Drama.</p><p>JOCELYN LEVI STRAUS, former chairman of the Texas Commission on the Arts.</p><p>JAMES WOOD, director of the Art Institute of Chiacgo.</p><p>The independent commission that is reviewing the grant-making procedures of the endowment concluded its fourth and final public hearing today after listening to several proposals intended to strengthen the agency.</p><p>Testifying on Monday before the commission, Mr. Frohnmayer disturbed a number of his listeners when he responded to a question about what he had meant when he referred to certain art ''not appropriate'' for public financing.</p><p>He said a photograph of ''Holocaust victims might be inappropriate for display in the entrance of a museum where all would have to confront it, whether they chose to or not.''</p><p>Representative Sidney R. Yates, the Chicago Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee that originates the arts endowment's annual appropriation, said in an interview today that he was upset by the chairman's remark.</p><p>''I don't know what he had in mind by that,'' said Mr. Yates. ''I'm on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, and I think it's very necessary that we remember the Holocaust and not sweep those photographs under the rug.''</p><p>Photo: John E.
