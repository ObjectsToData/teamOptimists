                    <p>A variation on the White House proposal was stated by John E. Frohnmayer, the chairman of the endowment, in an afternoon appearance before a Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee. He said he ''would be willing to settle for a three-year or one-year extension.''</p><p>Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana, who is the chairman of the House subcommittee concerned with overseeing the endowment, said, ''There does seem to be some conflicting signals coming out of the White House.''</p><p>Most members of Congress take or lean to one or another of these positions on the arts endowment:</p><p>* Reauthorizing the endowment for five years with no restrictions on the grants it makes.</p><p>* Reauthorizing the endowment for one year without restrictions and reconsidering the matter in a nonelection year.</p><p>* Reauthorizing the endowment in changed form, with most of its budget distributed by state arts councils, for example.</p><p>* Reauthorizing the endowment for one to five years with restrictions to prevent it from supporting the sort of art some members of Congress have found obscene or blasphemous.</p><p>* Eliminating the endowment.</p><p>Leaders of Congress and main committee chairmen say they hope to conclude the debate by the end of June.</p><p>''The White House has been careening from goal to goal,'' said E. Thomas Coleman, a Missouri Republican who is the ranking minority member of the House subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. ''A one-year extension simply puts this issue back on the floor during the appropriations process, in the same situation we faced last year. While I certainly intend to work with the White House, I think this is the wrong proposal at the wrong time.''</p><p>Representatives Paul B. Henry of Michigan and Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, Republican colleagues of Mr. Coleman, agreed.</p><p>Backing More Money for States</p><p>Mr. Coleman and Mr. Gunderson also urged the adoption of their proposal to restructure the arts endowment so that 60 percent, rather than the current 20 percent, of its budget would be distributed directly to state arts councils.</p><p>Although this approach has been repudiated by the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, which originally promoted it, Jack Duncan, a special counsel to the American Council for the Arts, a lobbying organization, said many Congressmen would find it difficult to oppose sending more Federal funds to their constituents.</p><p>Today's hearing, presided over by Mr. Williams, was the last of a series held in search of a resolution to the yearlong debate over Federal financing of the arts.</p><p>The furor was prompted by two endowment grants supporting photographic works by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano that some members of Congress said they found obscene. Congress added restrictions to the endowment's fiscal 1990 appropriation barring the agency from financing obscene art.</p><p>The arts endowment received support today from a spokesman for the General Accounting Office, an investigative agency of Congress, who reported on a study of the agency requested last year by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who has been a leading critic of the endowment.</p><p>Last March, Senator Helms asked the agency to investigate whether the endowment had violated the Congressional ban on financing obscene art.</p><p>But Henry Wray, general counsel for the agency, told Mr. Williams's subcommittee that the agency's review and legal analysis indicated that the endowment has met its legal obligations. Senator Helms called the report a whitewash.</p><p>Congressman Quotes the Public</p><p>In his opening remarks today, Mr. Williams said: ''Can we find a way to continue this little agency that has been so successful? I think we can. American people are speaking overwhelmingly against Big Brother censorship by right-wing evangelical cuckoos.''</p><p>As the Congressional panels met to discuss extending the life of the endowment, the 12-member Presidential commission appointed to study the way the endowment makes its grants convened at the Federal Trade Commission, a location chosen to emphasize its independence from the arts endowment.</p><p>Immediately after being sworn in, the commission went into closed session to elect a chairman. When the meeting was reopened to the public an hour later, John Brademas, the president of New York University, announced that he and Leonard Garment, a Washington lawyer prominent in arts organizations, had been elected co-chairmen.</p><p>Supporters of each of the co-chairmen divided along political and ideological lines before the meeting. The White House and conservatives had urged the selection of Mr. Garment, who served as a special consultant to President Richard M. Nixon. Democrats on the commission leaned toward Mr. Brademas, who served in the House of Representatives from Indiana from 1959 to 1981.</p><p>Brademas's Experience</p><p>For 10 years, Mr. Brademas also was chairman of the House subcommittee responsible for extending the life of the arts and humanities endowments, and throughout that period he successfully fought off proposed restrictions on grants based on the content of art projects.</p><p>John T. Agresto, the president of St. John's College in Santa Fe, N.M., said he had spoken against the selection of Mr. Brademas because ''if the commission is to be truly independent, Mr. Brademas has to be regarded as too close to the endowments.''</p><p>Two other commission members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that strong appeals for unity had been made during the closed session of the commission, and that as soon as Mr. Brademas and Mr. Garment announced - evidently having reached a prior agreement -they would be pleased to serve as co-chairmen, they were quickly elected.</p><p>The Presidential commission was created by Congress in October as part of a compromise worked out by a House and Senate conference committee to authorize funds for the endowment for fiscal 1990. The compromise rejected a proposal by Senator Helms that demanded restrictions be placed on arts grants by the endowment.</p><p>Time Runs Out</p><p>Congress gave the commission 180 days in which to study the two endowments and make recommendations. That period ended in April, well before the commission could meet because of delays in appointments and security clearances. Consequently, the commission must now ask Congress to accept a late report. Congress usually agrees to such requests.</p><p>The first dispute on the commission broke out when Mr. Garment remarked that one of the commission's tasks was to decide ''what is the difference between public and private support for the arts.''</p><p>Joan White Harris, a former commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs in Chicago, immediately corrected Mr. Garment, observing that the commission's Congressional mandate was to determine whether the standard for publicly financed art differ from the standard for privately supported art.</p><p>Mr. Garment said, ''I yield.''</p><p>Photo: The Presidential commission to study the way the National Endowment for the Arts makes grants elected John Brademas, left, and Leonard Garment, right, co-chairmen. With them at meeting yesterday was David E. Connor, a member of the commission. (George Tames for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
