                    <p>Hampshire College was born 20 years ago this fall in an apple orchard in western Massachusetts. As the many journalists who described its infancy were wont to say, the school had a silver spoon in its mouth and a frisbee in its hand. It was a college that gave no grades, had no departments, and didn't offer tenure to faculty. Academically, students were free to do whatever they wanted. The year it opened, Hampshire was one of the hardest schools in the country to get into.</p><p>If the question mark had not existed, Hampshire would have invented it. The heart of the curriculum was asking questions: students learned ''modes of inquiry.'' The new philosophy was summed up in the motto Non Satis Scire, To Know Is Not Enough. The poet Archibald MacLeish spoke to the hope surrounding this ''new departure'' in education when he delivered the address at Hampshire's inaugural convocation. ''I think,'' he said, ''we may be present at a greater moment than we know.''</p><p>Now two decades and 5,000 alumni later, Hampshire finds itself one of the last of a breed. Its survival alone is something of an accomplishment. Experimental colleges have retrenched or vanished. The University of California at Santa Cruz has modified its curriculum. New College of the University of South Florida in Sarasota merged with the state university. Nationwide, the trend is toward fewer electives, more structure. Best-selling books like ''The Closing of the American Mind'' blame the experiments of the 60's for the decline in academic standards.</p><p>Does Hampshire instill anything traditional methods do not? It's always hard to measure the value of educational method, but the nature of Hampshire's program makes assessment doubly hard. When students have such a large role in their own illumination, how much do you credit the college?</p>                </div>

                    <p>As one of the guinea pigs in the experiment, I've always thought a good argument could be made that the social aspect of Hampshire - the shock-the-parents coed bathrooms, group living in the ''modules'' and the obligation to cook, clean, and fetch groceries from the Mixed Nuts co-op every week - had as much impact on undergraduate experience as the interdisciplinary curriculum and ''modes of inquiry.'' But maybe not. And maybe even wanting to measure the worth of an education is wrongheaded, born of a consumerist mentality that views the mind's development as product refinement. In any case, this spring I packed a couple of frisbees in the car, assumed a mode of inquiry, and drove up to the orchard to revisit the experiment, such as it was 20 years ago, and such as it is today.</p><p>It used to be that we were taller than the trees. Now the saplings that line the blacktop driveway are robust oaks. I wandered around in the reverie of an April morning. The land sloped west toward a valley full of chopped-out cornfields and renascent pasture. Students drifted in and out of the library. Book cache, television studio, cliff face for instruction in rappelling, it is still the eye of the college. The bulletin board in the basement was a montage of campus life unchanged by time: panic-and-stress workshops, film festivals, poetry readings, for-sale signs and notices of missing pets (Simon the cat had disappeared from Module 54).</p><p>For a school with little respect for tradition, much seemed the same. The old frisbee field had been replaced by a warren of solar-heated arts and academic buildings, but Ultimate Frisbee was still the reigning sport, as it was in the early 70's, when Hampshire had one of the best teams in the country. The Dionysian spirit was alive and well in the unofficial ''clothing optional'' floor of Merrill House. The ''Trip or Treat'' Halloween party had made its way into college guidebooks.</p><p>Backpacks and sneakers, blue jeans with holes in the knee, a certain scruffy air: students look the same, too, though today 70 percent come from public school and 30 percent from private - the reverse of 1970. The campus is still predominantly white, despite the college's expressed commitment to a racially and ethnically diverse community. At $20,240 a year, a Hampshire education is one of dearest in the country. Nearly half the students receive some sort of financial aid from the college.</p><p>Clothes, intellectual positions and even behavior are governed by the code of the ''politically correct,'' which is to say antisexist, antiracist, antihomophobic, antispecist. One of the unforeseen aspects of Hampshire turned out to be how sexually uptight the place was, even in the anything-goes atmosphere of the early 70's. And some of those inhibitions endure as students sacrifice spontaneity to project correct behavior. No one would undo Hampshire's commitment to feminist values, which have produced on-site day-care facilities and positions of power for women, among other things, but all that right thinking can sometimes have puritanical overtones.</p><p>A photograph by Jerome Liebling, a Hampshire professor, of the naked torso of his baby daughter - part of Liebling's impressive exhibit on display in the library gallery - had recently come under attack in an anonymous letter in the student paper. The writer argued that because a child cannot consent to having her genitals photographed, the picture constituted child abuse: ''God help me if I see any more child pornography condoned on this campus again.''</p><p>''Sometimes it's hard to be a heterosexual male here,'' said Halstead York, who was having breakfast in the dining hall with his friends Jeri Chittick, Rebecca Drury and Elizabeth Rosenthal.</p><p>''Students are trying so hard to be open-minded they're close-minded,'' said Jeri.</p><p>''A lot of the issues I believe in,'' said Rebecca. ''I consider myself a feminist, but people on campus don't think I am.''</p>                </div>
