    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  BY the time I graduated from college in the spring, I realized that if ''The Graduate'' were to be remade for the 1980's, at least one script change would be required: the key word to occupational success, solemnly delivered to a bewildered Dustin Hoffman, would not be ''plastics,'' but ''computers.''    A few other changes also might be in order.   The graduate, unable to obtain financial aid from Stanford, would have attended the University of California at Los Angeles instead; his graduation present, if any, would be a fuel-efficient Rabbit Diesel rather than an imported sports car, and his post-matriculation paralysis would be unceremoniously terminated by a letter from the Federal Government, reminding him that the first payment on his $10,000 in student loans had come due.   Despite these changes, the movie's central question would remain the same. Does one seek to fulfill one's personal ambitions, or settle for a more pragmatic option, in the form of plastics or data processing?">

                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In ''The Graduate,'' the choice seemed clear. Either one sold out to plastics and all it stood for, or one didn't. Today, however, such a simple solution has vanished. Employment of any kind is not to be sneered at, and electronic technology seems more than just another industrial boom. It is fast becoming a part of our intellect.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Unlike Dustin Hoffman, some 1980's graduates seem to be discovering a more sophisticated answer, a middle ground between the pursuit of truth and a career in transistors. It is one that straddles the zone between practical high-technology training and complete immersion in classics, between idealism and employment.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As an English major at Oberlin College, a small liberal-arts institution with no computer-science department, I once considered myself a refugee from both high technology and vocational training. I had transferred there after a year in a premedical program at the University of California, which offered an exceptionally mercenary and unscrupulous group of students its electron microscopes and prize- winning scientists.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Ironically, I never touched a computer until I arrived in Oberlin, Ohio, changed my major from biology to English, and my intended career field from medicine to journalism.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Like many of my fellow graduates, my time in Ohio included both the more traditional stomping grounds of a liberal-arts education and a series of unexpected ventures into state-of-the-art-technology. Perhaps Shakespeare and the silicon chip did not play equal parts in my experience, but they were both strong influences.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Oberlin is probably best known for its music conservatory and as the first American college to admit women and blacks. During my time there, however, it was in the process of making another addition to its campus: the personal computer.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    After several years of training and encouraging students to use the school's main computer for word processing - in addition to math, physics and computer- course applications - Oberlin began promoting personal computers. By making a special arrangement with a computer manufacturer, the school began offering the units during my senior year to faculty members and students for about the price of an I.B.M. typewriter. More importantly, it provided the use of high-quality printers, plotters and expert advice at no cost, through the library.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    By the end of that year, several hundred computers could be found around campus, about one unit for every 10 students at the college.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    At the time all this was happening, I had become editor of Oberlin's student paper and was attempting to get an English honors thesis under way, obligations that required a seemingly impossible output of words each week. I became a personal- computer owner because I needed to write more efficiently than was possible at a typewriter.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Although I had taken a course in BASIC and learned word processing as a summer intern at a newspaper, I had not realized that high technology could be so vital to those in the humanities as to those in the sciences. Along with other computer owners, I attended the Oberlin ''Users Group,'' whose name correctly implies the addict-like quality of its members. Those in this group were, and are, in the process of redefining a liberal-arts education, using technology as an aid to their fields intstead of an alternative to them.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Most students started out the way I did, using the computer as no more than an extremely versatile typewriter. But others had branched out. Music students were programming synthesizers with their computers. A professor had written a program that enabled him to compose musical scores at the keyboard - as he pushed buttons, a plotter traced exact and lower staves, and then drew in notes, rests, and key signatures. One day, I noticed that a program that electronically administered Greek language drills had become available in the library.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The newspaper's advertising manager, a particularly ambitious student, convinced the school's administration to lend him the funds for a computer. In addition to his plans to automate the paper's billing procedure, he said he needed it to maintain the records of an investment-counseling service he was running to pay for his education.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As I stated before, Oberlin had no computer-science department; however, it did manage to put together a computer team. The small and thoroughly anonymous squad traveled to a regional Fortran programming competition, where it placed first, handily defeating teams from such schools as the University of Michigan.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    My own involvement with computers quickly began to branch out. I spent several hours each day in front of the screen, alternately taking hurried notes for my thesis and writing editorials. Soon, however, I began to have some computer-oriented reporters submitting finished copy to me on disks, which enabled me to edit electronically. This, in turn, led me to use the computer to estimate the lengths of stories and to write headlines. In the process, of course, I inadvertently learned a good deal about how the machine worked.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Toward the end of the year, I turned in the first honors thesis composed entirely on a personal computer. The machine had served its purpose. Yet, as I look back, I can see that the real value of my involvement with the electronic age was that it changed the way I saw my education.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    At a school that had no computer-science department and offered no journalism courses, I had become a reasonably proficient computer operator and gained admission to a journalism graduate school. I had also, I found, become employable.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Not long after commencement, my plans for graduate school forced me to turn down a job with a small newspaper near Boston. The job was offered to me partly because the paper was switching to electronic typesetting, and the paper was looking for someone with a knowledge of computers and word processing.  Perhaps most important, after four years of college I have finally left behind what might be called the ''Graduate'' syndrome. And perhaps it was no accident that I wrote my English thesis on Vladimir Nabokov, a scientist and writer, who was once a tennis pro, and who always sought to combine his practical with his more abstract pursuits.        </p>
