	 <p><span class="bold">ART</span></p>      <p><span class="bold">TABAIMO</span> An animation by the Japanese artist Tabaimo,  32, is always a spectacle worth seeing, what with the enormous screens, the eerie digitalization of the Ukiyo-e, or Japanese &#8220;floating world&#8221; woodblock style, and the Surrealistic erosion of innocence into violence, sex or self-abuse. In her &#8220;dolefullhouse,&#8221; a hit at last summer&#8217;s <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/v/venice_biennale/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about the Venice Biennale.">Venice Biennale</a>, giant hands arranging furniture in a dollhouse start scratching at the structure to reveal bleeding human flesh.</p><p>  Tabaimo&#8217;s second solo show in New York centers on &#8220;public conVENience,&#8221; above, a three-screen work from 2006 set in a spacious restroom reminiscent of a train station (&#8220;ven&#8221; is Japanese for public). Forgoing innocence, this piece progresses from weird to very weird, as the facilities are used in all sorts of symbolic ways. One woman dives into a toilet, another washes obsessively, a third gives birth to a baby through a nostril. Large moths fly about, their cameralike eyes snapping pictures for a voyeur lurking outside a small window. The roving viewpoints make voyeurs of the audience, revealing a particularly female world of isolation, vulnerability and obliviousness. </p><p> Not a happy sight, you might say, but a beautiful one in which  the seductiveness  of the animation and the surreal plot turns are mitigated by the real-world emotional weight.</p><p>  In a second animation piece, &#8220;haunted house,&#8221; the camera moves ceaselessly, scanning a cityscape and various apartment dwellers going about their lives (committing murder included). Hitchcock comes to mind, and not only for &#8220;Rear Window.&#8221; The animation ends when a bird suddenly smacks into the window we look out of. Yikes.

Organized by the Japanese Art Society, this show anchors the &#8220;floating world&#8221; of ukiyo-e prints firmly in economic and social reality. It  includes works by well-known artists, including Hokusai and Hiroshige, and emphasizes the entrepreneurial role of print publishers and the relationship between printmaking, painting and literature in the Edo period. Because the prints are sensitive to light, &#8220;Designed for Pleasure&#8221; will be shown in two installments. Of the 148 works in the exhibition, 95 are currently on view; about two-thirds of those will be rotated out on April 4. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, <a href="http://asiasociety.org" target="_">asiasociety.org</a>.</p><p> (Karen Rosenberg)</p><p><span class="bold"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/brooklyn_museum/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Brooklyn Museum">BROOKLYN MUSEUM</a> : &#8216;UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,&#8217;</span> through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,  (718) 638-5000, <a href="http://brooklynmuseum.org" target="_">brooklynmuseum.org</a>. </p><p>(Ken Johnson)</p><p><span class="bold">&#9733; <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/cooperhewitt_national_design_museum/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum">COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM</a>: &#8216;ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,&#8217;</span> through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, <a href="http://cooperhewitt.org" target="_">cooperhewitt.org</a>.

The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, <a href="http://elmuseo.org" target="_">elmuseo.org</a>.

You need no grounding in art theory to understand the messages generated by this powerful brain-pincher of a theme show. The archive of the title is less a thing or a place than a concept, an immersive environment: the sum total of documentary images, mostly photographic, circulating in the culture, on the street, in the media and finally in what is called the collective memory.

If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history&#8217;s great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and C&#233;zanne all adored him.

You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for &#8220;serious&#8221; in art; Poussin&#8217;s was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise.

(Holland Cotter) </p><p><span class="bold">MUSEUM </span><span class="bold">MUSEUM OF MODERN ART : &#8216;COLOR CHART: REINVENTING COLOR, 1950 TO TODAY,&#8217;</span> through May 12. Organized by Ann Temkin, a curator in the museum&#8217;s department of painting and sculpture, color functions as a ready-made in &#8220;Color Chart&#8221; &#151; something to be bought or appropriated, rather than mixed on a palette. The show is a rejoinder to the notion of color as the province of formalists, and to the idea that Minimal and Conceptual art comes only in shades of black, white and gray. In the upper section of the lobby a floor created by the artist Jim Lambie surrounds concentric strips of brightly hued tape.

The word denkmal translates from German as monument or memorial. In Dutch it is a mold for thought. Both definitions fit the work of Jan De Cock, a 31-year-old Belgian artist who appropriates and arranges photographs in what might be viewed as an open-ended yet ultimately conservative encyclopedia. Overflowing with references to modern art, experimental film, photography and architecture, the project pulls most of the museum into its orbit. It incorporates elements of De Stijl, Russian Constructivism and Kurt Schwitters&#8217;s collage/studio Merzbau, among other things. It is also the starting point of a yearlong project called &#8220;American Odyssey,&#8221; for which Mr. De Cock will travel to various and document cultural landmarks around the country.

The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold &#8220;Adele Bloch-Bauer I.&#8221; Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt&#8217;s most famous painted mural, the &#8220;<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ludwig_van_beethoven/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Ludwig Van Beethoven.">Beethoven</a> Frieze&#8221;; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist&#8217;s signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, <a href="http://neuegalerie.org" target="_">neuegalerie.org</a>.

This pair of exhibitions focuses on the experimental period after the birth of photography (the 1850s through the 1870s). Film had not yet been invented, but glass-plate and paper negatives allowed artists to micromanage the camera&#8217;s performance or to bypass it entirely. &#8220;Monumental France&#8221; gathers 38 artisanal prints of French architectural landmarks. &#8220;Sketches on Glass&#8221; presents prints made with hand-drawn glass plates on light-sensitive paper (no camera required). Together these shows reveal that artists in mid-19th-century France blurred the distinction between the photograph and the unique object.

The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi&#8217;s &#8220;Japanese modern&#8221; furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi&#8217;s most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard,  Long Island City, Queens,  (718) 204-7088, <a href="http://noguchi.org" target="_">noguchi.org</a>.

This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early &#8216;80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, <a href="http://ps1.org" target="_">ps1.org</a>.

This year&#8217;s light-touch show takes lowered expectations &#151; lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin &#151; as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion.

It includes 100 objects presented in plausible if free-flowing domestic arrangements designed by India Mahdavi and demonstrates the timeless appeal of this French master&#8217;s fusion of Art Deco streamlining with the organic forms of the 1950s. Roy&#232;re excelled at lighting design, and when it came to seating, he made round, low and even squat look great.

(Smith)  </p><p><span class="bold">MARK SCHUBERT: &#8216;55 GALLON&#8217;</span> The trickle-down effect of Lynda Benglis&#8217;s early foam pour pieces and installations &#151; which she cast in heavy metals several years later &#151; is felt in this show of painterly, improvisational, no-nonsense sculpture. On the floor two aggregates of large foam spheres in shades of black, gray and white suggest scoops of melting ice cream consuming plastic lawn furniture and other junk. Meanwhile, in &#8220;Rapture,&#8221; foam and paint fasten scores of misshapen beer cans directly to the wall, creating a crazy quasi-painting that puns on Lyrical Abstraction (remember that?) and has a startling dermatological aspect, like stubble. Monya Rowe Gallery, 526 West 26th Street,  (212) 255-5065, <a href="http://monyarowegallery.com" target="_">monyarowegallery.com</a>, through April 5.

He would later go on to make grander, more complex works, but in many ways his painting was never freer, less predictable or more full of the future than in New Mexico. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, <a href="http://nyu.edu/greyart" target="_">nyu.edu/greyart</a>, through April 5. (Smith)<span class="bold">&#8217;UNDER PAIN OF DEATH&#8217;</span> This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including &#8220;The Last Supper,&#8221; an <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/errol_morris/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Errol Morris.">Errol Morris</a>-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstr&#246;m, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, <a href="http://acfny.org" target="_">acfny.org</a>, through May 10. (Johnson)</p><p><span class="bold">Out of Town</span></p><p><span class="bold"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/p/philadelphia_museum_of_art/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Philadelphia Museum of Art">PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART</a>: &#8216;NOTATIONS/WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: TAPESTRIES,&#8217;</span> through April 6. This uneven show of not-so-lively collages, sculptures and prints, and 11 large and much livelier tapestries based on the collages, confirms that the work of this South African artist is best in translation, filtered through a second process. In this case it is the craft of expert weavers; the degree to which their increase in scale, texture, intricacy and color improves on the collages is more than striking. The subject here is displacement, refugeeism and survival, conveyed by the imposing silhouettes of &#8220;Porters&#8221; that either carry or oddly merge with objects while seeming to move across 19th-century maps of Europe and other continents. The style is a kind of send-up of Baroque art, but the images point metaphorically and painfully toward the future. <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/benjamin_franklin/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> Parkway, at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, <a href="http://philamuseum.org" target="_">philamuseum.org</a>. (Smith)</p><p><span class="bold">Last Chance</span></p><p><span class="bold">DIANA COOPER: &#8216;OVERDRIVE&#8217;</span> Over the years this artist&#8217;s obsessive doodling has reached three-dimensions by various routes. Here, all red, it covers the stepped interior of an imposing sculpture resembling a ziggurat turned on its side. The doodling generates relief-like drawings in paper, vinyl and pins. But it also goes beyond that in &#8220;Orange Alert UK,&#8221; a room-size installation where regimented stripes suggest exploded walls. This apocalyptic romper room achieves a better balance between making and thinking, and process and meaning. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street,  (212) 727-3323, <a href="http://postmastersart.com" target="_">postmastersart.com</a>; closes on Saturday. (Smith)</p><p><span class="bold">MALE: WORK FROM THE COLLECTION OF VINCE ALETTI</span> A discerning collector with an impressive r&#233;sum&#233; (critic, curator, editor) and no budget to speak of tellingly installs a sampling of his holdings, mostly photographs. His single focus &#151; the male face and body &#151; is elaborated in photographs and a few watercolors that range through portraiture, erotic and pornographic images and high points of photojournalism. It is a splendid mediation on integrity of personal taste and the variety of beauty, love and sexual attraction. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 924-4212; closes on Sunday. (Smith)</p><p>  <span class="bold">&#9733; BRUCE NAUMAN: &#8216;DRAWINGS FOR INSTALLATIONS&#8217;</span> Ask almost anyone for a short list of the most influential contemporary artists, and Bruce Nauman&#8217;s name will be there. This survey of drawings related to his architecturally scaled installations ranging from 1968 to the present suggests why. Some of the drawings are preliminary sketches for later completed projects. Others are second-thought variations made after a piece was done. Still others &#151; a series of studies for underground installations &#151; are hard-core conceptual projects realized only on paper. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, <a href="http://speronewestwater.com" target="_">speronewestwater.com</a>; closes on Saturday. </p><p>(Cotter)</p><p><span class="bold"><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_museum_of_contemporary_art/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about New Museum of Contemporary Art">NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART</a>: &#8216;UNMONUMENTAL: THE OBJECT IN THE 21ST CENTURY,&#8217;</span>  The New Museum has eked as much exhibition space as possible out of its new, elegantly bare-bones building and is devoting almost all of it to a raucous, polemical first show. The premise, as reflected in the work of 30 artists (among them, Rachel Harrison, Isa Genzken, Eliot Hundley, Carol Bove, Jock Bock and Sarah Lucas), is that assemblage sculpture is the most viable art form of the moment. Lo-tech, cheap, portable and rough around the edges if not actually falling apart, it reflects our fractured times and also resists easy absorption by the art market. While visually messy, way too hip and a tad monotonous, the show is a gauntlet thrown down to other New York museums. It says: Get your nerve on. Take a stand. Do something that inspires true argument, not just endless kvetching. At 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, <a href="http://newmuseum.org" target="_">newmuseum.org</a>; closes on Sunday. (Smith)</p><p><span class="bold">MANFRED PERNICE: &#8216;DIARY</span>&#8217; The abject formalism that is rife in the 2008 Whitney Biennial and unanimous in the multilayered &#8220;Unmonumental&#8221; at the New Museum of Contemporary Art owes much to this German artist. His fourth gallery solo in New York continues his elevation of the nondescript and his sly deprecation of the conventions of display. The pedestal-like pieces, made mostly from chipboard and mounted on fit-together platforms, suggest a low-tech model for a city. Dated like diary entries, the pieces are based on a specific spatial or design experience, which they also provide. Anton Kern Gallery, 532 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-9663, <a href="http://antonkerngallery.com" target="_">antonkerngallery.com</a>; closes on Saturday. (Smith)</p><p><span class="bold">STERLING RUBY: &#8216;KILN WORKS&#8217;</span> This Los Angeles artist usually spreads his talents among multiple mediums, making this the first show devoted exclusively to his obstreperous, richly glazed ceramic vessels. Walking the fine line between decoration and tragedy, they suggest charred remains; small, rather grotesque votive objects; or Neolithic precursors to everyday objects like a child&#8217;s car seat or a football helmet. The innovative, excessive, sometimes violent notion of &#8220;hand built&#8221; suggests Peter Voulkos, but post-Schnabel. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100; closes on Saturday. (Smith)</p><p><span class="bold">ANDRO WEKUA: &#8216;BLUE MIRROR&#8217;</span> The beautiful if overlong video at the center of this exhibition builds on the set-up photography of early 1980s appropriation art, juxtaposing modernist calm with life&#8217;s turbulence in a promising way. But it fails to pull together the assortment of complacent sculptures, collages and paintings that make this show seem so adolescent and unanchored. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300; closes on Saturday. (Smith)</p><NYT_UPDATE_BOTTOM>
