                    <p>TO find the place where poetry and technology meet, one need only go as far as the Hastings-on-Hudson Middle School. There, in a basement laboratory, students have been working with holography - the young science that confounds logic with its optical magic.</p><p>A hologram is a three-dimensional record, on film, of the reflected light from a laser-lit object. Holography is the whiz-kid distant cousin of photography with tricks up its sleeve: even after an object is exposed to laser light (no camera is used), and the holographic plate is chemically developed, the image may be difficult to see. When the plate is viewed in the proper light, however, a revelation occurs: the picture plane seems to drop away; the image appears to be floating in space, so real you feel you could touch it.</p><p>Beginning students need not perfectly understand such holographic factors as object beams and reference beams, wave fronts and diffraction gratings in order to experiment with the medium and ponder its implications about the physical world. Especially not when the stimulating young British holographer and teacher, Susan W. Cowles, is on hand.</p><p>Ms. Cowles, who received one of the first master's degrees in holography given by London's Royal College of Art, recently spent a week in Hastings working with middle-school and high-school students as part of a ''Holography in the Classroom'' project sponsored by the New York State Education Department in conjunction with the Museum of Holography in Manhattan.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Quoting philosophers and physicists in talking about her field, Ms. Cowles sounds something like a poet. She refers to herself as a ''technological alchemist'' (''holography transforms substances,'' she says). She speaks of ''taking our feelings and intuition seriously in order to move forward in science,'' and using ''consciousness as a vehicle to discover more about the universe.''</p><p>Holographic images, Ms. Cowles said, ''are talismans that tap our collective unconscious.'' They represent a ''new physics'' that takes ''the old concepts of magic and integrates them with science, art and religion.''</p><p>Students are fascinated by the laser, whose ''coherent light'' (as opposed to the ''incoherent light'' of white light) makes holography possible, Ms. Cowles said. ''Students respond to the 3D images - to the fact that the thing is there but not there,'' she noted.</p><p>It is a tall order to explain holography and create holograms within a five-day period, but Ms. Cowles approached the challenge energetically, staying after school to help the students with their projects. Stressing that holography was ''an incredible way of revolutionizing drawing,'' she asked art students to look beyond the holograms that are found on credit cards and magazine covers and to aspire to making something more creative than, say, an apple that appears to float in space.</p><p>''Make this like a drawing or design project,'' she said. ''Try out your ideas. Construct an image and see how the laser transforms materials. Build something and bring it in.'' Caroline McLoughlin, a 9th grader, created an assemblage from odds and ends in the art room. Her semi-distinct hologram of a broken bottle, wire and a soap dish suggested a ghostlike relic of a lost civilization.</p><p>The now-you-see-it, now-you-don't nature of holograms lends to their mystery, but also makes displaying them frustrating to serious artists like Ms. Cowles. Students viewing an exhibition of her work in a school gallery had to sway from side to side or stand on their toes before the images became clear.</p><p>''Technically, holography is still in the Stone Age,'' said Ms. Cowles. ''The process is where photography was 100 years ago.''</p><p>Its limitations make pioneers of present-day holographers and comrades of those struggling together with the same problems. Last summer, Ms. Cowles became a mentor to Stefan Hampden, now a Hastings High School senior, who worked closely with her for six weeks at the School of Media Arts at the State University of New York at Buffalo, one of six summer schools in the arts run by New York State.</p><p>Mr. Hampden, whose interest in holography developed from his study of photography, described an intense period of experimentation and learning at the summer school, where ''we worked 20 hours a day, as long as we could stay awake.'' He said he approached his subject ''as an artist, yes, but also from the scientific outlook.''</p><p>Since the introduction of the laser in the early 1960's, holography has developed rapidly as a science. Dennis Gabor, who formulated the basic theory of holography, was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1971. Holograms have many applications in industry; holographic interferometry has been particularly useful in the area of non-destructive testing.</p><p>The Hastings school lab was set up with the help of R. Scott Lloyd, the educational services director at the Museum of Holography, who oversees the Holography in the Classroom program in collaboration with the state. Hastings is one of 18 school districts, and the only one in Westchester, participating in the state program. The community was selected because of its long-standing commitment to arts in education, according to Robert L. Reals, an associate in the state's Bureau of Arts, Music and Humanities Education and the administrative director of the School of Media Arts.</p><p>''Mary Lou never says no when it comes to the arts,'' said Mr. Reals, referring to Mary Lou Dickinson, Hastings' Superintendent of Schools, who is this year's recipient of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Alliance for Arts Education School Administrator's Award.</p><p>Mr. Reals described Hastings' hologrpahy lab as ''the most advanced in the program.'' The basement provides the essential vibration-free location for a room containing two four-foot by eight-foot work tables, and an adjoining ''wet lab'' where the plates are processed. The school owns a laser and some basic optical equipment, such as mirrors and stands.</p><p>Ian Lancaster, the executive director of the Museum of Holography, said that a holographic laboratory could be set up for between $1,000 and $2,000, ''depending on what kind of support is given by local businesses in supplying equipment.''</p><p>On Thursday, the New York State Art Teachers Association will participate in a holography workshop at the Hastings Middle School that has been arranged by Barbara Levine, Arts-in-Education Program Coordinator for the Hastings Public Schools. Linda Law, a holographer and teacher, will conduct the workshop.</p><p>Mr. Lancaster, of the holography museum, said that he felt holography had a place in the schools ''as a subject in its own right'' as well as in the study of science, math and art. The museum's goal, he said, was to help make holography ''an integral part of the school curriculum.''</p><p>At Hastings interested students will learn more about the process from Mr. Hampden, who will lead the holography club, as well as from Brian McGinnis, a high-school physics teacher and Natalie Schifano, an art teacher - both of whom are strong supporters of the program.</p><p>In March, Ms. Cowles will return to Hastings for two weeks of advanced work with students. This especially pleases Mr. Hampden, who is considering the field as a career.</p><p>''People eventually will have to become familiar with hologrpahy,'' he said. ''The quicker they do the quicker it will advance as an art form and a medium of communication.''</p><p>Photo of Susan W.
