                    <p>JAKE SCHWARTZ was a dentist who practiced in Brooklyn in the 1920's. He had always had a romantic attachment to books and one day he decided he'd had his fill of cavities. After a few exploratory skirmishes elsewhere he established himself in Bloomsbury, opposite the British Museum, under the name ''The Ulysses Bookshop.'' Jake had good taste in literature and a nose for trends. He also had a good head for the rare book business, which is how he became a kind of literary matchmaker who brought to the altar a Pennsylvania brick manufacturer, the University of Texas and Samuel Beckett, for a three-way marriage in which everyone grew richer - except Beckett.</p><p>The Ulysses Bookshop eventually gave up the ghost. Jake had a wartime fling with the theater in Hollywood, but he was never far from the rare book and manuscript trail, spending most of his time scouting in England and in France. My first encounter with Jake - by proxy - was in the late 1940's at an auction sale at the Parke-Bernet galleries. Among other things, I had bought a letter by Paul Verlaine that day and when I left the sale room, a nondescript little man in loose-fitting clothes followed me. As I think back on him now, he might have stepped out of one of Samuel Beckett's novels. He grabbed my arm, introduced himself and handed me a business card, all in one movement. It took me a minute or so to realize that although the card said ''Dr. Jacob Schwartz,'' this man wasn't Jake, but his brother David, who was Jake's legman, bundle boy, accountant and general United States representative. I learned from David that Jake was the previous owner of the Verlaine letter I had just bought.</p><p>Having seen me buy it, David had rushed in to pick up what the decoy had attracted. He tried to make an appointment to call on me but I resisted. It wasn't long, though, before I began receiving letters from Jake, sometimes from an address in Paris just across the street from the little hotel on the Rue de l'Universite where Joyce had stayed; later, from London and Brighton on stationery imprinted ''Dr. Schwartz / First Editions &amp; Manuscripts of Esteemed Authors.'' His letters boiled down to something not much more subtle than: ''If you've got the money, I've got the stuff.''</p><p>From almost the beginning of Jake's book-dealing, one of his principal customers had been a man named T. E. Hanley, of Bradford, Pa. Ed Hanley was a brick manufacturer, also into oil and gas, who had once been bitten by a rare book and had never recovered. Dealers knew he couldn't resist anything good and during the Depression and the postwar preinflation lean years they pressed him to buy whatever they could get their hands on. If he was short of cash, they let him pay in installments; he often was and did. Jake fed to Hanley nearly everything good that came his way: William Blake drawings and engravings, Whitman presentation copies, Shaw books, letters, manuscripts and memorabilia, Joyce, Wilde, Yeats, Dylan Thomas, both Lawrences, Pound, Eliot - the list is almost endless. Hanley made regular monthly payments and whenever he could scrape up some uncommitted cash, he would send Jake an additional check - a few hundred, a thousand or two - but Jake's salesmanship was both wily and irresistible and as the books and manuscripts kept pouring in, Hanley's unpaid bal-ance kept mounting. It reached $20,000, $40,000, $60,000, $80,000 - and these were 1953 dollars.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In the summer of 1956, Jake began writing to Hanley in characteristically enticing and hyperbolic style about his ''Beckett Collection'' and soon artfully described it in a pamphlet he entitled ''A Collection of Manuscripts and Authors Association Material of Samuel Beckett.'' Jake had 80 copies printed ''for Private Circulation . . . for Students and Collectors'' but really for Hanley. ''The writings of Beckett,'' it said, ''belong to no school: they will make one.'' Of Beckett's unpublished play ''Eleutheria'' -in Jake's translation, ''Mad Zeal for Freedom'' -Jake wrote, ''His rejections are superior to other dramatists' dream of perfection.'' The cover of one volume of the manuscript of Beckett's novel ''Mercier et Camier'' bears the note in Beckett's hand, ''Pairs et compagnons,'' which means, roughly, ''equals.'' Jake read Beckett's French as ''Pain et Compassion'' - ''Bread and Compassion'' - so that's how he listed the manuscript in his brochure. Of Beckett's first book, ''Whoroscope,'' he wrote: ''Two mental operations which interest Mr. Beckett are philosophy and lunacy.''</p><p>By now, Hanley was so heavily in hock to Jake that he didn't swallow the bait at once but wrote him: ''Should you still have the Beckett Collection in another two to three months, I will let you know if I can handle  [ it ] .'' Jake kept the needle in and before long Hanley's resistance collapsed. He rationalized his capitulation by referring to the ''Beckett Collection'' as a special ''outside transaction.''</p><p>But how did Jake manage to get all these Beckett treasures? Well, Beckett had no notion of their potential market value and he found it useful to have a little extra money. Jake, on the other hand, was an expert at separating people from things of that kind - and, as the French put it, under the best conditions. As a former dentist it was only natural that sooner or later he should come to be known as ''The Great Extractor''; known also, as Beckett once told me wryly, ''for his sparing use of anesthetic.''</p>                </div>
