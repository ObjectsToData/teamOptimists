                    <p>A major post is about to be filled by the Reagan Administration and, according to someone who has spoken to some of the candidates, each has been asked: ''Are you a Republican, what did you do for Republicans in the last election, and how much did you give to the party?''</p><p>So says Page Miller, director of the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of History, who is interested in who is chosen for the post not because it is a great partisan one but because it is perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation - that of Librarian of Congress.</p><p>There have been only a dozen Librarians since the position was created in 1802. Despite the preferences of Dr. Miller and others in the academic and library professions that merit be the primary consideration, politics has been a factor in the past and is likely again now that a successor is being sought for Daniel J. Boorstin, the 12th Librarian, a historian who plans to resign, effective June 15, to devote more time to his writing.</p><p>No one is suggesting that the administration of the library would be very much different whether the Librarian was a Republican or Democrat, a conservative or a liberal. And so the involvement of politics seems little more than an old-fashioned reward of the party loyal. Old Line vs. New</p>                </div>

                    <p>Susan Phillips, a White House official in charge of finding a Librarian, did not respond to a request for comment. But another person with close knowledge of the procedure said the politics this time did not concern Republicans vs. Democrats, but whether the nominee comes from the old-line Republican conservatives or the new, or neo, conservative school.</p><p>The position, which now pays $73,600 a year, is filled by nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate, and the White House is said to have two principal candidates in mind: Russell Kirk, the author and lecturer, who is favored by the Administration's traditional conservatives, and Gertrude Himmelfarb, the City University of New York historian, whose name is being pushed by the neoconservatives.</p><p>Others named as possible candidates for Librarian include these:</p><p>Robert Middlekauf, librarian of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in California and the author of a well-received book, ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution.''</p><p>Vartan Gregorian, head of the New York City Public Library.</p><p>James H. Billington, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution.</p><p>Robert M. Warner, former Archivist of the United States.</p><p>Neither Dr. Miller nor others in academic life find fault with politics playing some role in the selection process. They point to the selection of Dr. Boorstin, partly on political considerations, as proof that such an appointee can be a successful Librarian of Congress.</p><p>When Dr. Boorstin was named by President Ford in 1975, he was re-garded by Democrats and liberals as a conservative choice, largely on the record of his historical writings. A group of black employees contended that his writings ''demonstrated a lack of concern for blacks and other ethnic and racial minorities.'' The American Library Association complained that he was not a librarian. A Senator extracted a promise from Dr. Boorstin that he would not do any of his writing on library time.</p><p>According to Samuel R. Gammon, head of the American Historical Association, Dr. Boorstin succeeded because he delegated the professional librarian chores to others, kept his conservative political views to himself and became a staunch advocate for the institution, complaining forcefully and articulately, for example, when Congress sought to reduce its funds.</p><p>The experience of another distinguished Librarian, Archibald MacLeish, was almost the opposite of Dr. Boorstin's, since Mr. MacLeish was opposed by some in the Senate as too liberal when he was appointed by President Roosevelt in 1939. It was a political appointment, recommended by Felix Frankfurter, who remained a political adviser to Roosevelt even after he had named him to the Supreme Court. Further, Roosevelt encouraged Mr. MacLeish, a poet and playwright, to continue writing while serving as Librarian.</p><p>When asked how much politics would figure for the current appointment, Eileen D. Cooke, director of the Washington office of the American Library Association, said: ''It will depend on how Congress reacts. Now that the Democrats are in the majority in the Senate, it could become political if the President comes up with a right-wing candidate.'' Eager to Avoid a Fight</p><p>One person who has been consulted about the selection process said that the White House, pre-occupied with questions about policies on Iran and Nicaragua, was eager to avoid a bruising and potentially losing fight. Administration officials are mindful that the Senate last year thwarted appointments to the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Archives when they were faced with sharp opposition from academic figures.</p><p>The desire to find someone compatible with conservative philosophy and not likely to stir a partisan fight would appear to enhance the candidacy of Professor Himmelfarb, who was described by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, as ''not a political person.''</p><p>Professor Himmelfarb, Senator Moynihan said, is an ''impeccable scholar'' who should easily win Senate confirmation to the lifetime position. She would become one of the more visible women appointed by President Reagan and the first woman appointed Librarian by any President.</p><p>Senator Moynihan knows of the librarian process from the perspective of a candidate for the job. While he was serving as Ambassador to India, he recalled, he received an inquiry from the White House as to whether he would accept appointment by President Nixon as Librarian of Congress.</p><p>''I said no, I wasn't quite ready to leave government,'' Mr. Moynihan said.</p><p>photo of Daniel Boorstin (NYT)</p>                </div>
