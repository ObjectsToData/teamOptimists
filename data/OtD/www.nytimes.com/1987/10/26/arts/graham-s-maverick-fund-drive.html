                    <p>Some strategic fiscal footwork by the Martha Graham Dance Company has not drawn bravos from the National Endowment for the Arts. Bypassing the endowment, which has helped support the company since 1966, the Graham company has gone directly to Congress to seek a $7 million appropriation.</p><p>What's more, the Graham end-run could succeed. Last month, the Senate passed legislation providing $4.1 million for the company as a separate line item in the 1988 Interior appropriations bill. A joint Senate-House conference committee will take a final vote, possibly sometime next month. The money - $4 million of which must be matched by the company - would be used for filming repertory, setting up archives and renovating facilities.</p><p>The maneuver is highly controversial in cultural circles. For endowment supporters, it raises the issue of ''politicizing'' arts financing - a danger that the endowment was designed to avert by taking the grant process out of Congressional hands. There is also fear that the Government's chief financing arm in the arts, with a budget of $165.3 million in fiscal 1987, could be seriously weakened if other cultural groups were to follow the Graham strategy.</p><p>Graham allies, on the other hand, hold that the endowment does not have the resources to provide large sums for preserving the Graham heritage, and that Miss Graham's standing as ''a national treasure'' makes her a special case. Some even see the Graham initiative as highlighting the Government's failure to provide sufficiently for the arts. They believe her case could be used advantageously by the endowment to lobby for higher appropriations. 'A Symbolic Gesture'</p>                </div>

                    <p>Joseph Papp, producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival and no mean fund stategist himself, said: ''I admire anyone who has the chutzpah to make a move like that. There's so little money available for the arts anyway that I see it as a symbolic gesture. The money appropriated by Congress to the endowment should reflect the size and wealth of the country. Martha Graham is one of the great institutions of America. She is exceptional, not a precedent, and if she is a precedent, we should have more like it.''</p><p>But to endowment officials, the bypass attempt attacks the very heart of their financing process, which provides for peer-review panels whereby professionals in each arts field consider grant applications on their merits. The panel decisions are then examined by an advisory body, the National Council on the Arts, composed of culturally involved citizens.</p><p>A statement issued by the office of Frank Hodsoll, chairman of the endowment, said: ''While Martha Graham is a great artist and needs resources to perpetuate her standards and vision, we oppose the high-powered lobby and the resulting Senate action as contrary to the American tradition of basing Federal support for specific artists on the review of their fellow artists.''</p><p>At Mr. Hodsoll's urging, the National Council also produced a resolution calling for Congressional rejection of the Graham company's request, on grounds that it would go against ''the long and widely respected Federal tradition of Federal support in the arts through a competitive peer review process.'' Council Dissent</p><p>But one council member, Raymond Learsy, a New York businessman and art collector, refused to go along with the resolution. ''As a member of the council I feel our responsibility is to the entire arts community, not just the endowment,'' he said. ''And I don't think we should bar the arts community from access to funding that is available to every other sector of our society.''</p><p>In 1983, the company's request for a $1 million challenge grant to record its repertory on film and renovate its East Side home was turned down by the endowment, although it did grant the company $250,000 for filming and preservation the following year. The company has also, each year, received general operating support from the endowment, amounting to $327,000 in fiscal 1987, including a $125,000 ''emergency grant.''</p><p>But Graham aficionados object to the lack of a mechanism in the financing process to provide the kind of structural help the company feels it needs. ''No program exists in the endowment to preserve the life's work of a national treasure such as Martha,'' said Ron Protas, general director of the company. ''Besides, she has no peers, aside from Balanchine, and he's dead. We're not asking for general support, but for help in preservation and restoration, and we're asking just once.''</p><p>While there is no precise precedent for the Graham company's move, old Washington hands remember an attempt on the part of the American Film Institute to get around the endowment. In 1974 the Film Institute began a campaign for its establishment as a quasi-government agency, with two-thirds of its budget supplied by the Federal Government.</p><p>The institute's argument was that as ''the most pervasive and influential of all the arts,'' film deserved such independent Federal support. But, despite the political influence of George Stevens Jr., who was the institute's director, its campaign was unsuccessful. The institute remains the endowment's largest single grantee. Gathering Support</p><p>The Graham company does not lack for political influence either. The notion of going directly to Congress for funds was broached by Richard E. Burke - president of the company's board of trustees since last March -who spent a decade in Washington working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, most recently as his chief aide. A Washington lobbying firm was hired to help present the case.</p><p>One of the chief supporters in the Senate is now Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. A member of the House who recently expressed his high regard for Miss Graham is Sidney Yates, Democrat of Illinois, an ardent arts supporter and chairman of the House Interior Appropriations Subcommitee; he has refused to comment on the pending legislation.</p><p>Bypass maneuvers are far more common among constituents of the New York State Council on the Arts, where grant applicants frequently succeed in getting state legislators to help them obtain funds by means of separate line item appropriations.</p><p>Asked how she felt about the Graham company's move, Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairman of the State Council, defended the ''peer panel'' system. ''The Federal and the state governments have created a system of peer panels and checks and balances to support the arts,'' she said, ''and I believe this is the way the money should be allocated.''</p><p>Whether the Graham maneuver succeeds or not, it has drawn attention once again to the issue of Government financing for the arts, its adequacy and its flexibility. ''Maybe,'' one devotee suggested, ''some thought should be given to the Japanese system, whereby persons and institutions designated as 'living national treasures' are subsidized over their lifetimes. Martha would certainly be a prime candidate.''</p><p>Photo of Martha Graham (NYT)</p>                </div>
