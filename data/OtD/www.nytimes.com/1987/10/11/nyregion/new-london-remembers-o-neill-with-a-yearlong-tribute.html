                    <p>EUGENE O'NEILL always kept a memory of New London, and his plays are filled with scenes and characters of the city where he spent many summers. Beginning this week, organizations in and near that waterfront city will remember America's only Nobel Prize-winning playwright, in a yearlong series of events to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth next year.</p><p>The events begin Thursday with the opening of an exhibit of O'Neill memorabilia, continue with lectures, readings from his plays and showings of movie adaptations of his works, and conclude with the unveiling, on Oct. 16, 1988, his 100th birthday, of a statue of O'Neill that is being erected in the harbor of New London.</p><p>The statue is being modeled after a well-known 1893 photograph of O'Neill as a boy, in high-laced boots and an Eton cap, seated on a rock near the city's lighthouse.</p><p>In coming months, groups around the country will also focus on the O'Neill centennial, but few have such claims on him as do those around New London.</p>                </div>

                    <p>O'Neill was born in New York City, but spent most summers during his youth at a Victorian-style cottage in New London that overlooks the Thames River and was owned by his parents. Because his father, James, was a well-known actor who spent much of the year on the road, the New London residence was the family's only permanent home.</p><p>The cottage served as the setting for ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' It is known as Monte Cristo Cottage after the play ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' in which his father played the role of Edmond Dantes for over 20 years. The cottage can still be visited.</p><p>In New London, the young O'Neill developed a love of the sea, spent a lot of time in bars and worked for a local newspaper, The New London Telegraph. In addition to using the city as the setting for his autobiographical ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' he set two other of his major plays in New London - ''Ah, Wilderness!'' and ''A Moon for the Misbegotten.'' He wrote plays with sea themes - 13 set entirely at sea and 6 others with the sea as a central theme - and remembered local personalities when creating characters.</p><p>Most of the centennial events are part of Collaborations III, an O'Neill festival organized by the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford and Connecticut College and the Monte Cristo Cottage, both in New London.</p><p>Other area organizations are also planning activities. One, on Saturday, sponsored by the Marine Commerce and Development Committee of New London, is a free movie festival of full-length adaptations of O'Neill's plays.</p><p>The Collaborations activities will begin at 4 P.M. Thursday, with a ceremony at Blaustein Humanities Center at Connecticut College that will open a monthlong exhibition of O'Neill first editions, foreign editions, correspondence, photographs and memorabilia at the Charles Shain Library at the college. There will also be a talk by Oakes Ames, the president of the college, on O'Neill's ties to New London. At 8 P.M., Richard Sewall, professor emeritus of English at Yale University, will give a lecture on ''O'Neill's Sense of Tragedy,'' also at the Blaustein Humanities Center. The events are free.</p><p>Saturday's film festival will be at Garde Theater, on Captain's Walk in New London; the films are ''Anna Christie'' (1930), at 2:30 P.M., starring Greta Garbo; ''The Long Voyage Home'' (1940), based on four of O'Neill's one-act plays and directed by John Ford, at 3:45 P.M.; ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), O'Neill's only comedy, with Mickey Rooney and Lionel Barrymore, at 6:30 P.M., and ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' (1962), with Katharine Hepburn and Jason Robards, at 8:30 P.M.</p><p>Also on Saturday, from 5:30 to 6:30 P.M., there will be readings of scenes from ''Ah, Wilderness!'' and ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' at the Dutch Tavern on Green Street in New London. The readings will be by the Dutch Tavern Players, a group of local writers. The tavern is one of the area bars frequented by O'Neill, according to the assistant curator of the Monte Cristo Cottage, Lois McDonald.</p><p>On Nov. 18 at 8 P.M. in Dana Hall at Cummings Art Center of Connecticut College, the actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who is known for her portrayal of Mary Tyrone, representing O'Neill's morphine-addicted mother, Ella, in ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' will discuss the other problems that tormented Mrs. O'Neill, among them her feeling of responsibility for the death of a son, Edmund.</p><p>Ms. Fitzgerald will describe Mrs. O'Neill's relationship with her parents and her feelings of guilt in the lecture, called ''An Irish Electra: The Demons of Mary Tyrone.'' Mrs. O'Neill's feeling ''that she was guilty and was going to be punished was there before she was put on drugs,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in a telephone interview. ''She had deep problems to deal with. Drugs were only a part of it.''</p><p>On Nov. 19, 20 and 21, the theater department of Connecticut College will perform ''Beyond the Horizon,'' O'Neill's first Broadway play, which was produced in 1920 and for which he won the first of four Pulitzer Prizes.</p><p>On Dec. 17 and 18, ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' will be presented by college students at the O'Neill Theater Center's National Theater Institute. Passages from biographies of O'Neill will be worked into the production so that audiences ''will be looking at O'Neill's father and family through O'Neill's eyes,'' said the director of the institute, Lynn Britt.</p><p>In February, students of Mohegan Community College in Norwich and actors from the community will give a reading of O'Neill's ''Mourning Becomes Electra,'' accompanied by music written by Neely Bruce, the chairman of the music department at Wesleyan University.</p><p>The Hartford Stage Company has plans for a staging of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' in the spring.</p><p>Other lectures at Connecticut College will be on the playwright's disdain of children, the intellectual climate of his time, his debt to Greek drama, films based on his works and his popularity in many countries. The final lecture will be next October and will be given by Barbara Gelb, co-author of ''O'Neill,'' a biography of the playwright.</p><p>Also participating in the centennial are the public libraries of Groton, Lyme and Waterford, which are offering programs on ''Long Day's Journey'' as part of a Southeastern Connecticut Library Association series on biographies.</p><p>The bronze statue to be unveiled on Oct. 16, 1988, is by an Old Lyme sculptor, Norman Legassie. It was commissioned by the president and founder of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, George C. White.</p><p>Collaborations is funded by the Connecticut Humanities Council, the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and the Bodenwein Foundation. The foundation also funded the film festival. For a schedule of Collaborations events, call 447-7610 or 447-7523, and for the film festival, 443-8331.</p><p>Photo of librarians Brian D. Rogers and Mary R.
