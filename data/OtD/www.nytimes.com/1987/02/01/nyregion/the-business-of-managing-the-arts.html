                    <p>MARY HELTON ''couldn't say no anymore'' when Virginia Hoff called for the third time to ask her to teach at the Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale. That was in 1951, when Ms. Helton was pursuing a career as a chamber music pianist and accompanist in New York City. Today, Ms. Helton directs the school, as she has since 1973.</p><p>Kathryn Wolfe danced with the company of the Steffi Nossen School of Dance when she was in high school, and did volunteer work for the school after her children were born. A part-time position there led to increased responsibility until in 1979; when Miss Nossen died, Ms. Wolfe became the executive director of the school as well as of the Dance in Education Fund, which administers the school and other programs.</p><p>Joan Vinton, director of the Performing Arts Center of the State University of New York at Purchase; Susan Shoulet, director of the Castle Gallery of the College of New Rochelle; and Gita Padegs, director of the Gallery at Hastings-on-Hudson, are others who originally volunteered or worked part-time for organizations they now head as professional arts managers.</p><p>In all, at least 23 women hold top leadership positions in the county's nonprofit arts organizations. Only five of these women have received formal training in the relatively new academic field of arts administration. For the others, it has been a matter of learning on the job, accepting advice from experienced board members, and attending as many lectures and workshops as possible - in particular those sponsored regularly by the Council for the Arts in Westchester.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In separate conversations, none of the women described feeling overwhelmed by the demands of juggling annual budgets of up to $800,000, managing full or part-time staffs of up to 60 people, or writing a continual stream of financing proposals. Many, in fact, said they found this new facet of their experience exhilarating.</p><p>''When I started to do administrative work I found I loved it,'' said Ms. Helton. ''I'm very organized, and that part of it really appealed to me.''</p><p>There are visionaries and entrepreneurs among this group. When Bira Rabushka moved from Manhattan to northern Westchester, she saw that the area lacked an arts center. To fill that need, in 1978 Ms. Rabushka founded and became executive director of the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Goldens Bridge, today a thriving organization that she said is ''bursting the seams'' of its home, the town's former schoolhouse.</p><p>''I wanted to do something for my community and also give my children what I had growing up in New York City - that rich cultural ambiance,'' said Ms. Rabushka, a violinist who has been a member of the New York City Ballet Orchestra for 22 years.</p><p>Tina Sattin also saw a need that grew out of her own work as an actress. The result of her vision is the Open Cage Theatre in Mount Vernon and its umbrella organization, the Mount Vernon Fine Arts Cultural Center, which Ms. Sattin serves as executive director.</p><p>''I realized that the acting craft could be beneficial to the educational structure. It helps people training-wise,'' said Ms. Sattin, who explained that she believes there is a correlation between building character on stage and in real life. In drama workshops at Open Cage, Ms. Sattin and other theater professionals teach young people ''to act without getting caught up in drugs. If you give good, wholesome technique, you don't need the drug,'' she said.</p><p>A concern for the well-being of children led Camille Linen to give up her job as head of the English department at Port Chester High School to found and direct the Port Chester Council for the Arts. The organization provides daily after-school workshops and other arts programs to students in kindergarten through fifth grade, who receive no art instruction as part of the curriculum.</p><p>''We're doing what the schools aren't,'' said Ms. Linen. ''I'm on a real crusade about this. Art is part of human nature. It gives kids who may not be gifted academically a way of expressing themselves.''</p><p>While most of the arts directors have had some past experience as visual or performing artists, several draw on extensive personal backgrounds for their present work. Madeleine Gutman, executive director of the Arts and Culture Committee of the Town of Greenburgh, was taught ballet by teachers from the Bolshoi, studied piano with Nadia Reisenberg and attended the National Academy of Design. Lilian Joffe brings her experiences as a pianist and longtime arranger of concert series to her concurrent positions as manager of the Westchester Symphony Orchestra and program director of winter concerts of the State University at Purchase.</p><p>While some of the women attempt to continue working as artists, most say it is working with people that gives them the biggest reward.</p><p>Shirley Contino-Phillips switched from painting to business administration while still a student at the University of California and said she has never regretted the decision. The associate director of the Council for the Arts in Westchester, she said her present job is a perfect mix of everything - her studio art and business training, as well as her background in education (she holds a master's degree in museum education). ''I enjoy most putting the pieces together and seeing it all work,'' said Ms. Contino-Phillips, echoing sentiments expressed by many of the women. Marilyn Becker, who became the executive director of the Pelham Art Center last August after previous gallery experience, said she was glad to no longer be ''painting in isolation locked in a basement.'' Work as an administrator, she said, ''taps all my abilities,'' including writing. ''The work is interesting and fun and a way to get out into the world in a field I love,'' she added.</p>                </div>
