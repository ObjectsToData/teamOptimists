                    <p>SUCCESS at last. One week before spring term of '86 I was asked to teach a course at Quinebaug Valley Community College in Danielson. I had just earned my master's degree in English and for eight months I'd been searching for a job. The course was called Business, Technical and Report Writing.</p><p>I felt confident about the writing part, less so about the business and technical part, but I could learn. During the five days before the class started, I read the textbook twice.</p><p>I loved that semester. I found I was good at lecturing and at leading discussions and that I inspired enthusiasm and self-confidence in my students.</p><p>By the end of the term I was proud of their performance and of mine. Here, I said, was the profession for me. But when, in my zeal, I told a fellow part-timer at my school that I looked forward to a long career in the state's community college system, I learned the sad facts of part-time teaching.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Oh, I knew I was earning next to nothing and that not even full-timers were paid well. But I assumed that my own salary was only what they paid beginners.</p><p>In a few years, I figured, I'd wind up either as a full-time or permanent half-time instructor, with fringe benefits such as job security, a pension plan and medical insurance. I wouldn't get rich, but I'd earn a respectable income.</p><p>I figured wrong. My colleague told me that the community college system would happily hire me for the rest of my working life without paying me substantially more than I was earning right then - or $1,149 per three-credit course. If I taught two courses a term, which I hoped to do, I would make $4,596 a year - not half, but a fraction of what they paid full-timers, whose salaries ranged from $20,000 to $36,000.</p><p>And no matter how long (or how hard) I worked as a part-timer, I would never receive any benefits, neither medical coverage, vacation pay, sick leave nor free tuition for my family. What's more, I had no way to improve my situation by rising through the ranks.</p><p>Every term, part-timers - newcomers or veterans - waited in the same line. If enrollment for a particular course was not sufficient, the part-timer lost a job. Against this litany of bad news, my colleague sarcastically added one note of cheer: after I taught 18 credits (or about six courses), I would qualify for a raise of about $30!</p><p>Naturally, when union contracts came due for professional staff at the state's community colleges, as they did every three years, I could press for better wages and working conditions. But I would be unlikely, my colleague predicted, to convince our state's Board of Trustees of Regional Community Colleges or our state legislators that I deserved even half of what full-timers earned, per course. When I asked why, she told me my employer assumed that I spent no time counseling or advising students and that I took no interest or responsibility in running the school.</p><p>A full-time teacher attends staff meetings and sits on committees while I am free to lecture and leave. Never mind that, as a writing instructor, I spend hours grading papers and holding individual conferences with students. According to the official view, I do no such things. As for committee and staff meetings, I taught for an entire term before I realized that I was welcome at these gatherings. Once I found out, I showed up whenever I could, on the theory that the more I knew about the school (and vice versa), the better a teacher I'd be. I later discovered that many part-timers contribute hours to projects such as academic planning, the development of new courses and the publishing of college newspapers.</p><p>I was also told that my employer believed that I had a full-time job elsewhere, so I didn't need a salary. Or maybe I was one of those housewives who wanted to keep a hand in the teaching profession while she raised a family. We all know that these women don't need money.</p><p>Finally, I was told that I probably had a husband who provided me with medical insurance, so why did the state need to duplicate benefits? In short, from an official point of view, I had no real affiliation with my school. The state could rely on me year after year to perform a vital role in the community college system, but pay me as if I were a temp.</p><p>If this weren't bad enough, I learned that part-timers seldom make it into the ranks of full-time employment and that I could devote half my career to a school like Quinebaug Valley, only to be ignored when someone from outside came along and scooped up a full-time position. After all, while I clocked up service as a part-timer, what credentials did I gain? I also learned that there were hundreds of people like me floating through the system, that we even had a trade name -gypsy scholars - and that we made up half (and more) of the faculty on all 12 Connecticut community college campuses. The state was pleased to draw from this pool of cheap specialized labor.</p><p>As I listened to my colleague's tale of woe, I convinced myself that she had to be a crank, one of those malcontents who blames the system for her own failures. (I neglected to ask myself why she'd been hired back, each term.) Still, to be safe, I checked around and, to my amazement, learned that every word the woman said was true - and then some. I had landed in the world's worst job. I liked the work, it was full of personal satisfaction, I could perform well and certainly improve. But I would never earn a respectable wage. Now, at the end of my third semester as an English teacher at Quinebaug Valley Community College, I face a terrible choice: should I quit my job because my prospects are lousy or should I stay and fight? If I stay, will I spend my entire career complaining and getting nowhere? If I leave, will I be sorry to have backed down from an important issue?</p><p>I tell myself that an informed public would never tolerate the conditions of exploitation that exist in our community colleges. What's more, there are so many women part-timers; surely we can prove that we are discriminated against, as a class. And yet, numbers alone don't tell the story.</p><p>I have heard that about half the part-time faculty positions are held by men. But I have also heard that men are primarily hired from business and computer fields, where they are either retired or moonlighting from lucrative jobs.</p><p>Women, on the other hand, tend to be concentrated in the humanities, where the course work is heavy and the enrollment is high. English departments, for example, rely almost exclusively on female part-timers to teach writing.</p><p>But because our union doesn't keep up-to-date statistics on part-time teachers, the truth about how men and women fare in the system isn't known.</p><p>Certainly, the union would be happy to win better salaries for part-timers, but only after they first serve the needs of the full-time staff. In the union, then, as in the whole system, part-timers are second-class citizens.</p><p>So I am torn. I have heard about others quitting over the same frustrations that I am only beginning to experience, and some of these people lasted years. I know I will have to find another job, soon, to support my teaching ''habit.''</p><p>When I tell my friends that I teach college English, they nod with approval, assuming I belong to a high-status profession. When I tell them I work a 30-hour week - two courses a term, two terms a year - for a grand annual salary of about $4,500, they think I'm kidding.</p><p>But this is no joke; it's a real tragedy and the saddest part is that my employer is not a fast-food chain or a discount drug store, but the richest state in the country. Makes you wonder how the part-timers are doing in West Virginia.</p><p>drawing</p>                </div>
