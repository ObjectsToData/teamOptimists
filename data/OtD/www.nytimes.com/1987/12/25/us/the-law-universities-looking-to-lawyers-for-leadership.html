                    <p>As the complexities of running a college or university push their presidents out of the ivory tower more often, the schools are looking beyond academia in finding the right person for the job.</p><p>Increasingly, whether it really makes a difference or not, they are turning to lawyers.</p><p>This year's example is Thomas Ehrlich, the new president of Indiana University, who had been provost at the University of Pennsylvania and was once dean of Stanford's law school. In making the shift to higher education from a background in the law, he joins the presidents of Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Barnard, Dartmouth, Berkeley, the Universities of Virginia, Miami and Florida, and dozens of smaller schools.</p><p>While experts in higher education hesitate to declare this a trend, they say it has caused academics to question exactly what is it about lawyers that has made them attractive to selection committees searching for new college presidents.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''There's a good reason for it,'' said Dr. Clark Kerr, an economist who is the former president of the University of California and a founding director of the Institute for Industrial Relations at Berkeley. ''There's so much more litigation than there used to be. A university president these days really has to have a lawyer at this side.'' Living With Controversy</p><p>Furthermore, he said that lawyers ''by the very nature of their work have to become accustomed to living with controversy,'' a routine element in the daily professional life of any college president.</p><p>Dr. Kerr, who has written two studies on the American college and university presidency, says filling the job with someone who has a legal background ''certainly has been a trend among the leading institutions.''</p><p>''The big, elite institutions are much more in the forefront of litigation and political, social and ethical controversy,'' he said. ''They are sort of out there on the front line.''</p><p>Experts in higher education also suggest that universities and colleges, which have traditionally selected their presidents from a pool of academic scholars with background in the liberal arts, may now beturning to lawyers because the position increasingly requires more political, financial and managerial skills. How to View a Problem</p><p>''Lawyers are trained to take a problem, break it into its component parts, work through the issues and put it all back together again,'' said Mr. Ehrlich of Indiana. He added, however, that lawyers did not have ''a monopoly or special lock on those qualities.''</p><p>University presidents, confronted with a Reagan Administration that has repeatedly cut Federal education funds and student aid, are also often required to be fund-raisers who can move easily in circles of foundation executives and philanthropists.</p><p>''I think the generalization I would make is that institutions are more concerned about management skills in their presidents these days,'' said Dr. Ronald Stead, director of presidential search for the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities. ''In general it's a much more complicated job than it was two decades ago.''</p><p>Dr. Stead's Washington-based association, which represents 1,100 colleges and universities, has worked with more than 150 schools in the last decade to ''help them assess their requirements for leadership'' and to recruit presidential candidates, he said. Most Still From the Ranks</p><p>Lawyers certainly do not make up the majority of presidents among the nation's 3,301 four-year public, private and church-affiliated colleges and universities in the United States. ''The tendency still is to select someone who starts out as a faculty member and who has worked his or her way up,'' said Dr. Stead.</p><p>That view is shared, to a degree, by Dr. Ruth Weintraub, vice president for executive search for the Academy for Educational Development, a nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and Washington that has placed presidents at more than 100 educational institutions.</p><p>''My perception is that when things are normal, the faculty or selection committee is still looking for the person who has come up through the ranks,'' said Dr. Weintraub, a former dean at Hunter College who holds both a Ph.D. and a law degree.</p><p>The new incidence of selecting lawyers to head universities is ''something that could not have happened 10 years ago,'' Dr. Weintraub said. She explained the current phenomenon as ''a response to the litigiousness of the 1970's that brought lawyers to the front.'' More Problems to Face</p><p>David Riesman, the retired Harvard University sociologist who has for the last seven years studied the selection process, also noted the number of lawyers serving as university trustees, often yielding presidential selection committees headed by lawyers who may be more likely to tap one of their own.</p><p>At the same time, says Derek C. Bok, president of Harvard since 1971, the problems for presidents have grown as educational costs rise and tuition and fee increases far outpace the rate of inflation. ''Over the last 50 years, the number of practical administrative and political problems that a college president has to face have increased enormously,'' said Mr. Bok, a product of the Harvard Law School.</p><p>''There perhaps is a temptation to turn to people with a broad range of experience who can deal with the practical issues,'' he said.</p><p>Benno C. Schmidt Jr., president of Yale, said that because of the nature of law school faculties, these days a law professor or dean was likely to be as steeped in academia as a professor or dean from the liberal arts or humanities. It Isn't the Legal Skills</p><p>''In my own case, I spent about as much time teaching with a historian as I did teaching prospective lawyers,'' said Mr. Schmidt, adding that lawyers had made good college presidents probably because of their academic emphasis, not the law degree. ''It's really the similarities more than the dissimilarities with other academics,'' he said.</p><p>Michael I. Sovern, president of Columbia and former dean of the university's law school, added that while law schools often served as a ''farm system'' to administrative positions elsewhere in a university, it was rarely because of the legal skills of the professor.</p><p>''There is nothing to that at all,'' said Mr. Sovern. ''I have nothing to do with our litigation and I'm sure the trustees didn't think of my litigative skills for a minute in the course of my selection for this job,'' he said.</p><p>Echoing an assertion made by other lawyer-presidents, Mr. Sovern said that the law school had become ''intellectually acceptable in the university context'' and much more a part of the university as a whole.</p><p>''Fifty years ago, to select a law school dean would be like making an outsider university president,'' he said. ''Now we are very much academics, and the style of leadership is very well suited to leading an entire university.''</p><p>Photos of attorneys who are college presidents (NYT; Tom victor; The Dartmouth/Daniel P.
