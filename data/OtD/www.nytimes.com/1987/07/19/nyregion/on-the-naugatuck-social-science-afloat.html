                    <p>BENEATH towering highway bridges and past the backs of billboards, the procession of canoes made its way along the Naugatuck River, its occupants talking of Indians, colonial settlers and the bygone days when factories harnessed the river's power to transform Waterbury into a manufacturing center.</p><p>The occasional sighting of a beaver lodge or the flash of a fish caused everyone to marvel how far the river had come ''since it was just considered to be the dirty old Naugatuck,'' said Roger La France of Middlebury, a tour participant.</p><p>The tour, formally entitled ''The River as an Urban System,'' was led by Matthew Roth, a 34-year-old historian who heads Historic Resource Consultants, a Hartford company that provides historic research and consulting services. It lasted five hours and took in nearly five miles of the 35-mile river, which rises in Litchfield County and flows south to join the Housatonic River in Derby.</p><p>Sponsored by the Mattatuck Museum, the purpose of the tour was to demonstrate how the city's development affected the river, changing its course, polluting it, and more recently, cleaning it.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Participants paid $15 each to come along on the trip, which was held one recent, hot Sunday. Also along were members of the Waterbury museum's staff, including the program specialist, Marie Galbraith, who said she thought this river tour was one of the museum's best programs.</p><p>''The museum is industrial and historical, as well as being concerned with art,'' she said. ''But, in creating programs, the general criterion I use is, 'If something is interesting to me, it must be also to 100 others.' I always wanted to canoe down the river because otherwise you can't see what's here.''</p><p>Mr. Roth said the river made an excellent laboratory to demonstrate how decisions made by the people of Waterbury over the years had affected the waterway.</p><p>''The theme of this trip is the river as an urban sytem, because it is the interactions along the river, and how those competing interests are brokered, that reveals how a city makes its choices,'' he said. ''This is where the community's role is laid bare.''</p><p>Since the tour was geared for anyone, not just skilled canoeists, the day began with a quick lesson covering the rudiments of river navigation from Corky and Susan Clark, who run the Mountain Workshop, a Ridgefield company that specializes in outdoor expeditions and helped to organize the trip.</p><p>Periodically, the canoes drew alongside of Mr. Roth's boat, for a quick discussion of points of interest, ranging from an arched concrete bridge to a sewer riser from the line beneath the river, a concrete structure that, on a river, performs a function similar to that of a manhole cover on a street - ''It lets the gas escape, so there isn't an explosion,'' Mr. Roth said.</p><p>According to Mr. Roth, the entire history of a city can be viewed from a river. And, in the case of the Naugatuck, he said, ''this is a river which owes its engineering to people as much as nature.''</p><p>From his viewpoint, any river can be viewed in three different ways: as a resource, as an obstacle and as a threat, and it is the way in which the community deals with these aspects that shapes what will happen to the river.</p><p>In the case of the Naugatuck, the Indians who settled along the river first used its waters as a resource, drinking it and eating the fish that swam there. When the colonists arrived, they dug wells for their clean water, and began using the river as a dumping ground. Eventually, the water became too dirty for shad and salmon. But the river grew increasingly important for power, and by the mid-1800's factories dotted the banks, and dams were being constructed, despite the fact that the long, shallow Naugatuck is not very powerful.</p><p>''If the city had relied on only the Naugatuck for power, it would not have become the great manufacturing center it did,'' Mr. Roth said.</p><p>Water still gushes forcefully over the Waterbury Brass Company dam, a structure that seems even more remarkable because, Mr. Roth said, when it was operating at full capacity, ''it furnished only 200 horsepower.''</p><p>''My neighbor has a Chevy Nova that puts out 300 horsepower,'' he said.</p><p>Power from the dam was later supplanted by steam, and then by purchased power, Mr. Roth said.</p><p>But water power was not the only use for the Naugatuck during Waterbury's manufacturing heyday. The river waters proved to be perfect for the processing of brass, which was so bound up with Waterbury that it gave the city its nickname, ''the Brass City.''</p><p>''Brass needs to be 'pickled,' which means that it needs to be bathed in sheets of a solution of water and acid,'' Mr. Roth said. ''The river was perfect for this, and Waterbury produced millions and millions of pieces of hardware, such as buttons, clock gears, lots of light hardware for the mass market.''</p><p>At first, the sewage dumped in the river did not form a serious problem and, indeed, the shoals helped process the waste as it moved along the water. But the building of dams caused the water to stagnate, and eventually become a breeding ground for bacteria and such diseases as typhoid and malaria. Although the city built a sewer line during the early 20th century, the water of the Naugatuck did not become cleaner until the 1950's, when the city finally build a solid-waste treatment plant, Mr. Roth said.</p><p>During his discussions, Mr. Roth said that he had studied city records going back hundreds of years, and that officials were very aware that their use of the Naugatuck was fouling it.</p><p>''What we know now as environmentalism existed in the 19th century and what happened to the river was a conscious choice,'' he said. ''They knew what they were doing and what we can infer is that their decision was, 'If we are going to be an industrial society, this is part of the cost.' But we cannot judge the people of the 19th century by the standards of today.''</p><p>Also along on the trip was Dr. Bruce Fraser, who is executive director of the Connecticut Humanities Council, but came on the trip ''just representing myself,'' he said.</p><p>Earlier this year, the council joined with Mr. Roth to try to raise money to expand this program to several other rivers. The effort failed, but Dr. Fraser remained enthusiastic about the value of such trips.</p><p>''This is a different type of program,'' he said. ''It's innovative. Why should the humanities be taught only in classrooms and lecture halls? The river itself is a book.''</p><p>Last year's first excursion attracted 12 participants; 20 people took the recent trip; the next trip this year, scheduled for September, already has a waiting list of 45, Ms. Galbraith said.</p><p>For the participants along on this trip, the tour represented a multitude of different experiences. For Joan La France, who brought her husband, Roger, and her children, 12-year-old Mark, and Mary Joan, 9, along, this was a trip of memories. As a youngster, she crossed the river daily to get to school. Her father ran a restaurant nearby, and she grew up listening to her mother tell stories of how, as a child, she worked in a button factory near the river.</p><p>''I grew up in Waterbury, so when I read about this trip I thought, 'This is for us,'' she said. ''It sounded educational and something different than going to an amusement park. But I didn't realize it would include all of these places I've grown up with. This is so exciting.''</p><p>Eventually, Mr. Roth wants to lead trips along the Pequonnock in Bridgeport, the Quinnipiac in New Haven and the Norwalk River, in that city.</p><p>''These are water sources that are ignored,'' he said. ''Everyone passes over them and rides next to them every day of their life, but it is something they never think about. These rivers are familiar, but ignored.''</p><p>Photos of canoeists on the Naugatuck River during history tour; Photo of Matthew Roth during history tour</p>                </div>
