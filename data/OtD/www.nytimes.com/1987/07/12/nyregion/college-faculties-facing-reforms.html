                    <p>AT A RETREAT at Fairleigh Dickinson University here recently, members of the state's Board of Higher Education met to ponder their agenda for the next five years.</p><p>They touched on a variety of topics, but kept returning to the need to provide services and support for the faculties at the state's 56 public and independent colleges and universities.</p><p>Comments during the meeting ranged from outrage over faculty members' reputations for indolence to concern about the ethnic composition of faculties and they way they are evaluated. The board's general mood was that New Jersey faculties are overworked and under-recognized.</p><p>''Good grief, they work hard,'' said Paul Hardin, president of Drew University, countering remarks by Edward Bennett, the United States Secretary of Education, that college faculties are lazy and overpaid. ''I simply cannot remain silent. They're working prodigiously hard.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Referring back to the 1960's, when students organized support groups for themselves, Thomas Gassert of Red Bank, the board's chairman, said faculties were now left with that responsibility.</p><p>''An awful lot of the burden of retention seems to be falling on faculty,'' he said.</p><p>Dr. T. Edward Hollander, the state's Chancellor of Higher Education, indicated at the meeting that faculties would be at the heart of a number of reforms he planned to set in motion in the next five years.</p><p>One initiative, an ''Institute for Teaching and Learning,'' would be established so faculty members could improve their pedagogical skills with the aid of outside evaluators.</p><p>According to Dr. Hollander, those who volunteer for the institute would undergo in-class observations, followed by specific recommendations on how to enhance their teaching skills. He said that the program would improve teaching throughout the state, since other faculty members would pick up some of their colleagues' sharpened teaching skills.</p><p>The institute also would assist colleges in developing systems of evaluating faculty for tenure and promotion. The systems would stress teaching ability, an emphasis that the Department of Higher Education is determined to press for when faculty contracts are renegotiated in 1989.</p><p>There would be special programs to keep faculty abreast of developments in their fields, and colleges would be encouraged to grant sabbaticals so that faculty members can rewrite their curriculums.</p><p>There was an underlying feeling at the meeting that the quality of student life on New Jersey college campuses had to be enhanced if they wanted to stem their decline in enrollments.</p><p>With an increasing number of students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds and broken homes, board members indicated that the timeworn image of tranquil ivied walls was being pushed aside by a growing number of disaffected students who have nowhere to turn for support.</p><p>''We want to change the atmosphere on campuses to be much more supportive,'' said Dr. Hollander, who is trying to figure out how the institute or some other kind of mech-anism could sensitize faculty to students' extra-academic needs. ''It's hard to do, and I'm not quite sure how to do it, but we're going to strike in that direction.''</p><p>Not all of the department's proposals call for the faculty to do more. The Chancellor is working on a non-monetary recognition system that would honor distinguished teachers.</p><p>''We don't recognize faculty for good teaching, and we don't honor faculty very much in this state,'' he said. ''Someone ought to say 'Thank you' publicly and openly.''</p><p>Anne Dillman of Perth Amboy, who is a member of both the state's Board of Education and Higher Education, suggested that nonvoting faculty and student representatives be appointed to the Board of Higher Education, as is the case for the Board of Education, in addition to faculty advisory bodies that Dr. Hollander has promised to appoint.</p><p>''If they speak out, who is going to listen?'' she asked.</p><p>Despite a state recruitment program that offers more than $40,000 in forgiveable loans to minority graduate students who agree to teach at a New Jersey college for four years, the number of minority faculty members at these colleges is shrinking, a fact that Dr. Deborah Wolfe, a board member from Cranford, found alarming.</p><p>''There's a high correlation between minority faculty and the retention of minority students,'' she said, stressing the importance of continuing the board's commitment to increasing minority enrollment.</p><p>Given New Jersey's rapidly changing demographics, the need to attract more minority students is directly tied to institutional survival. Projections indicate that nearly one-quarter of New Jersey's population will be nonwhite by the year 2000, reflecting an 87 percent increase in 20 years.</p><p>The Department of Higher Education has been attempting to increase minority enrollments for a number of years, but the number of blacks and Hispanics in the state's colleges has nevertheless been steadily declining.</p><p>The spectre of a continued slide in enrollments, both minority and overall, strikes fear in most college administrators. Because of the decreasing number of high school graduates, a persistently high percentage of students who attend college out of state and a dwindling number of nonresidents seeking their education in New Jersey, among other factors, the number of full-time college students in the state has dropped from 45,000 in 1979 to fewer than 34,000 last year.</p><p>Enrollments are expected to continue to decline through 1994, when they will reach a projected low of 25,000.</p><p>However, the depressing statistics are a source of hope for at least one board member.</p><p>''We're in a better position than most states,'' said Floyd H. Bragg of North Brunswick, Rutgers' representative on the board. ''I'm not as concerned about the figures as they appear because we have a great untapped market of students who go out of state.''</p><p>In other matters, Rabbi Martin Freedman of Paterson voiced concern over the spiraling cost of a college education.</p><p>''If the past five years repeats itself in the coming five years, we will be faced with stupendous costs,'' he said, suggesting that a new work-study program be developed for freshmen and sophomores to help students in inner cities, thus easing their need to borrow for college.</p><p>The importance of a liberal-arts education was also reaffirmed.</p><p>''What gets the hype is never the humanities, not even from us,'' said Mr. Gassert, urging the board to acknowledge achievements in the liberal arts, as well as university high-technology ventures.</p><p>Dr. Hollander said that his department was now prepared to switch from regulating colleges to working with them cooperatively to achieve their goals. Part of this would be accomplished by simplifying routine procedures, such as approving new facilities or degree programs, while increasing college participation in new reforms.</p><p>''The basic theme of 'partnerships' will pervade every aspect of our effort,'' a report outlining the department's proposed agenda said.</p><p>Specific proposals for change will be presented at the board's meeting in September.</p>                </div>
