                    <p>THE news from the Wadsworth Atheneum is all of John Pierpont Morgan, who, born and buried in Hartford, was one of its major benefactors. Without him, the museum would be half the size and its collection the poorer by 1,325 treasures.</p><p>Now 100 of these are on view for the first time in an exhibition celebrating the 150th anniversary of Morgan's birth. A major production accompanied by an illustrated catalogue that is jammed with information but, sadly, lacks the index necessary for its retrieval, the show remains through March 15. It then proceeds to the library Morgan had the architects McKim, Mead &amp; White build for him in New York and, finally, to the Kimball Museum in Fort Worth, Tex. The angels are the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts and, in Hartford, the United Technologies Corporation.</p><p>Installed in galleries, the walls of which are marbled light blue for the occasion, the display opens with information about Morgan himself. And rightly so, for though he was not the first millionaire to acquire art, he certanly set the style for those who followed him. He was not your average plutocrat either, yet he became the archetype and may yet become more interesting than his booty.</p><p>The son of a dry-goods merchant turned banker, Morgan was educated here and abroad and such was his talent for mathematics his teachers at the University of Gottingen urged him to continue his studies with a view to teaching the subject. But staying only one year, he returned home and at the age of 23 embarked on the career whose high points included the reorganization of the railroads, bailing out the Government during the 1895 run on gold, forming U.S. Steel in 1901 and, in the financial panic of 1907, preventing the failure of the Stock Exchange.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Morgan's career as a collector was no less imperial, though it didn't start until 1890, the year his father died. Taking his cue from the European aristrocracy, Morgan developed a grand plan, as Linda Horvitz Roth explains in her catalogue essay, to surround himself with art that had a place in history and, by bequeathing it to the nation, become himself a part of that history. Leaving his son John Pierpoint Morgan Jr. to distribute the collection (between the Metropolitan Museum, the Morgan Library and the Atheneum), he died a relatively poor plutocrat, leaving an estate that was valued at $68 million and a collection worth $60 million.</p><p>Another contributor to the catalogue, Neil Harris, points out that Morgan was no self-made millionaire driven by social insecurity, yet he behaved like one, buying compulsively if not indiscriminately. The curator of paintings at the Metropolitan during his presidency, Roger Fry, insisted that Morgan was a megalomaniac impervious to everything but flattery. But since Fry was a Bloomsbury-trained snob, his evidence should be taken with a grain of salt. As for the press, it regarded Morgan as the quintessential American moneybags plundering Europe for all it was worth - note the New York Times cartoon of figures jumping out of paintings in order to escape being bought by him.</p><p>Actually, illuminations leaping off manuscripts and porcelains abandoning their pedestals would have been more appropriate, since Morgan's specialty was the decorative arts. If this selection is representative, he was especially partial to 17th-century German tankards consisting of ivory cylinders carved with figures in high relief and bases, lids and handles made of silver gilt. It's hard to imagine someone daring to swig beer out of these masterpieces of Baroque, touched with Gothic, much less clinking them in a toast.</p><p>The most intrepid drinkers of all are those who would take on the nautilus shell goblets of the same era. One of these is engraved with a boat, crewed by two American Indians and two Africans in turbans. The European passengers consist of a woman who sits amidships, fanning herself under an umbrella, and her presumed spouse, who stands in the bough blowing a trumpet decorated with a banner. Its lip ornamented by a metal head that may be Neptune's, the shell reposes on the back of his son, Triton, whose fishtail legs straddle a turtle. But this isn't the end, for the eye has still to register the lump of amethyst and the gilt waves that it rests on before reaching the bottom and its supports, which look like octopuses. Victorian excess had its precedents.</p><p>Morgan knew superb craftsmanship when he saw it, but for all this and a New England background too, he was essentially a Victorian programmed for such lapses. For example, the show seems strong in Sevres (disagreeably so to this observer). But whether or not this is a proportional representation, the gaudy French porcelain was the sine qua non of the 19th-century ceramics collection. Compensating for its presence, however, is the Meissen ware of J. J. Kaendler, who was the first European to make porcelain figures. The specimens here are charming examples of ''Have a nice day'' rococo style, which might account for their eclipse by the artist's sparrow hawks, distressingly realistic though they are. Both perched on white tree stumps, one removes with surgical delicacy the pathetic little pink heart of a mouse; the other is busy with a lark's innards.</p><p>Another bonus is the 18th-century English mother who sits with her restive young sons in a church pew. This small, beautifully modeled stoneware is, along with the cruder Florentine majolica pots from the 15th century, a welcome relief. To some extent this is because they have the plebeian simplicity to which contemporary taste is attuned, and, for lack of an alternative, must remain so. But it is also a matter of the nostalgia for the magic blend of art and craft aroused by the show being followed by depression at the thought of its extinction. Nevertheless this is soon erased by reflecting on the absurdity of 20th-century consumers paying homage to one who had something to consume and did so to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>His nose disfigured by a chronic skin ailment, Morgan was no beauty. But his presence was as overwhelming as his art is gentle. Edward Steichen said that meeting his eyes was like facing the headlights of an oncoming train, and the photograph he took, the best of the Morgan portraits, proves it. Too bad it is not in the show.</p><p>Photo of ''J.
