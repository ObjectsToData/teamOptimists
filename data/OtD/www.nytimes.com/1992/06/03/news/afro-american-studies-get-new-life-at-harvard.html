Professors elsewhere in the university criticized the new department's scholarly work as mediocre. Some said the department was run by radical black students. And students and professors in Afro-American studies felt Harvard neglected them.   By the 1990-1991 academic year, the department seemed on the verge of collapse. Only one tenured professor remained, and Harvard students majoring in Afro-American studies found themselves in the unfamiliar position of having to go to Tufts University or Boston University to take required courses.">

Only one tenured professor remained, and Harvard students majoring in Afro-American studies found themselves in the unfamiliar position of having to go to Tufts University or Boston University to take required courses.</p><p>But now the Afro-American studies department has handsome new offices overlooking Harvard Square, four new professors have joined the faculty, and the department's new chairman, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a prominent black literary critic, has reorganized and re-energized the program.</p><p>In one year, the number of undergraduates majoring in Afro-American studies at Harvard has almost doubled, going to 37 from 19. "Gates has done miracles; the department is as different as night and day," said Mecca Nelson, a 21-year-old senior from Flint, Mich., who is majoring in Afro-American studies.

                    <p>Perhaps even more important, the transformation of the department at Harvard has national implications, at a time when Afro-American studies as a discipline has been under assault.</p><p>"Because of Harvard's national pre-eminence, what happens there gives Afro-American studies an intellectual legitimacy for other places," said Cornel West, the director of the Afro-American studies program at Princeton, considered by many to be the best in the country. "What's happening at Harvard makes it more difficult to trash Afro-American studies."</p><p>John Blassingame, a tenured professor of history and African-American studies at Yale University, concurred. "I've always said that until Harvard has a strong program, the enterprise called African-American studies won't arrive," he said.</p><p>At the center of the changes at Harvard is Professor Gates, known as "Skip" to his friends and colleagues, a 41-year-old academic entrepreneur who has been one of the most sought-after scholars in the country in the last decade. Cornell University made him a full professor at the age of 33 to lure him away from Yale, his alma mater; Duke University then gave him an endowed chair.</p><p>But he stayed at Duke only a year before accepting an offer from Harvard that made him simultaneously chairman of the Afro-American studies department, the W. E. B. Du Bois professor of the humanities and the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute, a research institute.  Fear of Closing</p><p>When he was first offered the job at Harvard, Professor Gates said in an interview in his office: "I thought the department had been cursed. Afro-American studies here were about to be shut down."</p><p>But Henry Rosovsky, the longtime dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, assured him that Harvard was now serious about building the best Afro-American studies program in the world.</p><p>"Harvard was the ideal situation," Professor Gates said. "I had always wanted to build an institution, and there was no dead wood to clear out."</p><p>In 1990, Mr. Rosovksy said, when both he and Derek Bok, who had been president of Harvard for two decades, were about to retire from administrative work, they decided to "make one last very determined effort" to build a good Afro-American studies department.</p><p>"We didn't want to leave that one last item in poor condition," said Mr. Rosovsky, who is still a professor of economics. "So we went out to look for the person who could do it, and we got Skip."  Time of Protest</p><p>It may have helped that a number of black students at Harvard were protesting the lack of a first-rate Afro-American studies program.</p><p>Professor Gates has moved quickly, securing the new offices and helping to bring in three new professors, including his closest intellectual friend, K. Anthony Appiah, a Ghanian-born philosopher who was also hired away from Duke. Professor Gates hopes to bring in several more new professors in the next few years, conserving his resources by making the appointments jointly with other departments like the Divinity School, and the music, fine arts and history departments.</p><p>In the past, making such joint appointments at Harvard proved difficult because many professors were skeptical of the academic quality of the work being done in Afro-American studies. Harvard's history department does not have a single professor working on Afro-American topics, and it recently cut short a search for a new professor in that field, concluding that none of sufficient stature was available, several professors said.</p><p>Mr. Gates has also made several high-profile moves to fill in the gaps in the department's course offerings and to give Afro-American studies more excitement. Last winter he invited a friend, Spike Lee, the film director, to teach a seminar at Harvard. The course was oversubscribed and so successful that Mr. Lee has agreed to come back again in the fall.</p><p>The Afro-American Studies Department has not offered graduate degrees, reflecting its diminished status at Harvard. But Professor Gates is optimistic that there will be a master's degree program soon, and after that a Ph.D. program.</p><p>Politically, Mr. Gates has disappointed some of the more radical students because he does not share their black nationalist or Afrocentric views. The Afrocentrists believe that the ancient Egyptians were black and that therefore Western civilization is derived from black Africans.</p><p>Mr. Gates said that some of the work being done in the more than 200 Afro-American studies programs around the country is intellectually "bogus" because, he contends, they are essentially inventing an African past that never was.</p><p>"You would think that the most urgent issue in Afro-American studies departments today would be the causes of poverty and how they can be remedied," he said. "But this is not the most urgent issue.</p><p>"The most urgent issue is whether Cleopatra was black. This is classic escapism and romanticism."</p><p>Professor Gates would like to see more rigorous scholarship, rather than what he calls "ethnic cheerleading," to separate truth from fiction.</p><p>In a conciliatory gesture this spring, Professor Gates invited the more radical students to send him their comments, and he has agreed to lead an informal reading course next fall examining some of the Afrocentric writings, Professor Appiah said.</p><p>"We told them we're grateful that they made a fuss, because that's why we're here," Professor Appiah said, referring to the student protests in 1990.</p><p>Photo: The Afro-American studies department at Harvard University has been re-energized by its new chairman, Henry Louis Gates Jr. (Sarah Putnam for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
