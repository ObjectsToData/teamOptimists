Later, reporting the incident to his daughter Garter Snake, the holy man of the Gros Ventre tribe said he was ordered that day by a Thunderer's voice to duplicate the shield. And then, he recalled, the image was gone, sucked back into the sky by the wind.   Bull Lodge's copy of that shield, made in the 1860's, is one of 152 painted, carved and beaded items in &quot;Art of the American Indian Frontier: The Collecting of Chandler and Pohrt,&quot; an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art here through Jan. 24, 1993. Over 65 years of collecting, Richard A. Pohrt has owned some 3,000 American Indian artifacts, of which the shield is his favorite.">

Later, reporting the incident to his daughter Garter Snake, the holy man of the Gros Ventre tribe said he was ordered that day by a Thunderer's voice to duplicate the shield. And then, he recalled, the image was gone, sucked back into the sky by the wind.</p><p>Bull Lodge's copy of that shield, made in the 1860's, is one of 152 painted, carved and beaded items in "Art of the American Indian Frontier: The Collecting of Chandler and Pohrt," an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art here through Jan. 24, 1993. Over 65 years of collecting, Richard A. Pohrt has owned some 3,000 American Indian artifacts, of which the shield is his favorite.</p><p>"It almost embodies the history of the people," he said. The shield combines buffalo hide with the feathers of eagles and owls, materials that suggest an even earlier time. And yet Mr. Pohrt pointed out "it's probably one of the last shields made by this tribe."</p><p>A broad portrait of tribal life in 19th-century America is seen in the show's ceremonial, decorative and utilitarian works, which were produced by Woodland and Plains Indians living between the Great Lakes and the Rockies. The women of these tribes stitched the beaded dresses, shirts, leggings, bags, cases and moccasins that dominate the show, presenting a kaleidoscope of vividly colored fashions. The men carved the bowls and clubs, painted the shields and drums and assembled the feathers for headdresses and the bear claws for necklaces.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"There's an old Indian saying that it's easier to kill an enemy who has a bear-claw necklace than it is to kill the grizzly bears necessary to make a necklace," said Mr. Pohrt, who is 80 years old. He retired in 1972 from the A.C. Spark Plug Company, a division of General Motors, where he worked in the personnel department.</p><p>At age 15, he met Milford G. Chandler, then 37, when the automotive engineer moved to Mr. Pohrt's hometown, Flint, Mich. Chandler's collection, formed with modest means over more than a decade, was virtually complete. Mr. Pohrt, however, possessed a few arrowheads and an insatiable curiosity about American Indians, fueled by reading Indian stories and a month spent working with 25 Pawnees traveling around Michigan in their Wild West show. "I had a marvelous time," he recalled.</p><p>Chandler became Mr. Pohrt's mentor and encouraged him to buy artifacts when he worked for several summers among the Montana Indians in the 1930's. Then, in the mid-1960's, the younger collector began buying his friend's holdings. "It took me several years," he said. "While prices at the time were not what they are today, I had a family to support." By the time Chandler died in 1981, at the age of 92, Mr. Pohrt had bought everything, about 1,500 items.</p><p>Most objects in the Washington exhibition are works the two collectors sold or gave to the Detroit Institute of Arts, where the exhibition was organized in association with the National Gallery and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyo. The catalogue, written by the show's co-curator, David Penney of the Detroit Institute, was published by that museum and the University of Washington Press ($60 in cloth, $32 in paperback). Financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan, the exhibition will travel next year to Cody, Detroit and the Seattle Art Museum.</p><p>During his summers among the Gros Ventre Indians, Mr. Pohrt came to know the tribe's history. George P. Horse Capture, a tribe member who is the show's co-curator, sought out Mr. Pohrt in the late 1960's to study his people's artifacts, most of which had been sold by the tribe. The collector, he said, showed him an elkhide storage bag made a century ago by Mr. Horse Capture's great-grandmother, Coming Daylight. Until then, Mr. Horse Capture had no idea it existed.</p><p>Although Plains Indians are primarily identified with their beaded garb, the drum and shield paintings in the show reveal their mystical heritage. On a Crow shield, a grizzly emerges from a cave leaving a trail of claw tracks. On a square drum made by either an Assiniboine or a Sioux, a horned, winged creature with round red eyes, faded mouth and fangs may represent thunder. Above its head, two circles, held aloft by bolts of lightning, "are a visualization of power," said Mr. Penney. "The horns are another power symbol. That's got to be one of the greatest Plains paintings of the 19th century."</p><p>Of the Plains regalia, it is the headdresses of eagle feathers that invariably quicken the pulse of viewers. The flamboyant headdresses worn into battle by warriors were not only symbols of bravery. "In the Indian way of thinking, bravery and generosity were closely associated," Mr. Pohrt said. "Generosity was seen as a form of courage that doesn't fear want."</p><p>Photos: A square drum, made by either an Assiniboine or a Sioux circa 1860-70, is part of an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art. A Crow headdress, fashioned around 1890 of buckskin, ermine skins, glass beads and eagle feathers.
