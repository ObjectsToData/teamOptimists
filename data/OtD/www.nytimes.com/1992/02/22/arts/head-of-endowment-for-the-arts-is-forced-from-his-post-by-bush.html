    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  John E. Frohnmayer, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was forced out of his job yesterday, apparently a casualty of the political wars. President Bush's decision to call for Mr. Frohnmayer's resignation came amid reports that Patrick J. Buchanan, the President's conservative challenger, would make an issue of Mr. Bush's support of the arts endowment as he campaigned in the South.    On Thursday, Mr. Buchanan scathingly attacked President Bush for having increased the Government's support for the endowment, which he called &quot;the upholstered playpen of the arts and crafts auxiliary of the Eastern liberal establishment.&quot; The same day, Mr. Frohnmayer said in a statement released yesterday, he met with the White House staff and &quot;determined that May 1, 1992 should be my departure date.&quot;">

                    <p>Mr. Frohnmayer refused to take calls from the press yesterday, but both he and President Bush released copies of their respective letters concerning his departure in which both men referred to Mr. Frohnmayer's expression of a "desire to return to private life" last October.</p><p>There were, however, reports that Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, announced at a senior staff meeting early Thursday morning that Mr. Frohnmayer would be leaving but would be allowed to announce his departure as a resignation. These reports were given credence because as recently as last week, Mr. Frohnmayer told The Washington Post that he did not have "any immediate plans to resign."</p><p>A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "The truth is, Frohnmayer had said back in October that he wanted to step down, but nothing happened. They thought they'd given him enough time and he hadn't done what he said he would do, so they called him in."</p><p>State Senator Bob Johnson, a Florida Republican and a member of the National Council on the Arts, which advises the chairman of the endowment, confirmed this version of what happened. "I was told 60 days ago by someone in the Administration," he said, "that John was on the way out. Then, two weeks ago, I was told the same thing but more definitively."</p><p>An adviser to the Bush Administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that recently over lunch he had urged Mr. Frohnmayer not to stay on in his job "until you become an election issue," but that Mr. Frohnmayer had remained indecisive.</p><p>Other Administration officials said the decision to push Mr. Frohnmayer had come before Mr. Buchanan's strong showing in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. They expressed consternation that the timing might make it seem that the President was responding to political pressure. An Added Provocation</p><p>Pressure on President Bush to cast off Mr. Frohnmayer was also applied by members of Congress and conservative groups aroused in recent weeks by the endowment's support of two publications with a particularly strong sexual content.</p><p>The publications, entitled "Queer City" and "Live Sex Acts," are issues of The Portable Lower East Side, a semiannual literary journal based in New York and edited by Kurt Hollander, an adjunct professor of humanities at the City College of New York. The books include poetry, prose and photographs that show or describe sex acts, including the highly publicized rape of a female jogger in Central Park.</p><p>Late last month, the conservative American Family Association of Tupelo, Miss., which frequently attacks the arts endowment, sent excerpts from the books to people on its mailing list, among them all members of Congress. The organization expressed outrage that tax dollars -- like all government agencies, the endowment consumes money from tax revenues -- would be used to support such publications.</p><p>A day or two later, Paul Weyrich, national chairman of the conservative policy group Coalitions for America, interviewed Constance Horner, assistant to the President for presidential personnel, on a satellite call-in television show watched by an audience of conservatives. "She got hit again and again with calls from people asking how she could tolerate those two books," Mr. Weyrich said. He added that Ms. Horner's assistant had told him that her boss was shaken by the calls.</p><p>A few days afterward, said a congressional staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity, Representative Dick Armey, a conservative Texas Republican who has long been a critic of the arts endowment, sent copies of "Queer City," "Live Sex Acts" and other material to a White House official, expressing indignation.</p><p>Mr. Weyrich said he understood the books had found their way to Ms. Horner, who told President Bush about them. Approval Defended</p><p>Asked about the matter, Ms. Horner said, "I can't possibly discuss it."</p>                </div>
