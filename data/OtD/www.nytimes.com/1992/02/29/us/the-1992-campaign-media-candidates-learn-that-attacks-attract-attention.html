                    <p>The Senator's remarks were carried on the nightly news of all the network affiliates here in Atlanta, and in virtually all the nation's major newspapers. On Thursday night, "Crossfire," the Cable News Network's nightly round-table show, was devoted to debating Mr. Kerrey's accusations and Mr. Clinton's qualifications.</p><p>On Friday morning, NBC's "Today Show" picked up the debate. And on Friday evening, CBS continued the discussion on its evening news.</p><p>"I think we had a pretty good 48 hours," one of Mr. Kerrey's top advisers said today with a hint of smugness.</p><p>On the Republican side, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist, also had a good two days, at least as measured by the amount of news coverage he received.</p><p>The excuse for the coverage was a commercial that Mr. Buchanan broadcast here on Wednesday. The commercial, indisputably the season's most inflammatory, shows half-clad gay men dancing in a scene from a movie subsidized by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The narrator accuses the Bush Administration of investing "our tax dollars in pornographic and blasphemous art too shocking to show."</p><p>Like parents who are secretly proud of the scrapes their sons get into, reporters and television commentators described the commercial in guardedly critical terms, but then proceeded to reward its sponsor by showing the advertisement in the midst of the evening news. Most of Atlanta's news shows offered at least snippets of the commercial. And on "Crossfire," while the program did not actually show the commercial, it did discuss Mr. Buchanan's attacks on Federal arts funding.</p><p>Media analysts say they are not terribly surprised to see candidates slipping back into the habit of negative campaigning: It is statistically proven to be the best way to get attention.</p><p>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, studied news coverage of political advertisements from 1988 through 1991. Her research shows that a negative commercial was 12 times more likely to be mentioned on the television news than a positive commercial, and six times more likely to be mentioned in a newspaper article.</p><p>Ms. Jamieson blames the press for teaching the candidates bad habits. "You basically give the candidates this little box and say if you want to get coverage, you better fit through this hole," she said. "So the candidates just take that attack and slam it through that hole and boy they get on the evening news." Journalists Defend Their Role</p><p>But most journalists say that politicians did not need the press to teach them how to attack one another. Voters, they say, are interested in how the candidates distinguish themselves from their rivals, and if attacks are the way they choose to do this, then attacks are what will show up on the news.</p><p>"If these are the things that end up being talked about by the candidates, these are things that are going to get covered," said Beth Fouhy, the producer of "Crossfire." Mr. Kerrey's attack on Mr. Clinton became a story, she said, because Mr. Kerrey engineered it that way.</p><p>"He chose to go out there and say this where he knew there would be network television cameras," she said.</p><p>Ron Billek, the news director of WXIA, Atlanta's NBC affiliate, defended his station's coverage of both Mr. Kerrey's attack and Mr. Buchanan's commercial, noting that both segments were part of a political package that gave all the candidates who were in Georgia that day some coverage.</p><p>Mr. Kerrey's criticism of Mr. Clinton "was just a sound bite we used in a broader piece," Mr. Billek said. "Had he not said that we probably would have lifted something else."</p><p>Perhaps because he is genuinely concerned about its effect on the process, or perhaps because he is simply concerned about being shut out of the news, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts appealed today to his Democratic rivals to agree to a moratorium on "trashing each other."</p><p>The Democratic contest, he said, "has turned unnecessarily nasty and ugly and the only beneficiary in this kind of war of attrition is George Bush."</p><p>Some media analysts, along with many reporters, say that the reason political attacks receive so much coverage is that they are just plain engaging -- more engaging than the debate over "managed competition" versus national health insurance. Voters are intrigued by the latest candidate dispute, they say, much the same way workers are intrigued by an office spat.</p><p>"It's kind of the train wreck fascination," said Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas in Austin, who conducted a detailed survey of the coverage of the 1988 election. A hearty bit of character assassination, he said, "raises the emotional intensity. And that's what reporters and everybody else likes."</p><p>Photo: Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska has learned that the best way to get on the news is to talk critically about his opponents.
