                    <p>FAME has come suddenly to Jonathan Kaplan, 11 years old, who made his debut on Broadway in late April in the hit musical "Falsettos."</p><p>One critic called him a young Woody Allen. Another called him a sage. He is nominated for a Tony for best featured actor in a musical. And while Jonny -- as friends and family call him -- is pleased with all of this notice, he is also proud of another accomplishment. Because his teeth have slight separations, he is able to spit a mouthful of water through them. "Looks like a fountain," he said modestly.</p><p>He would have been happy to demonstrate, but somehow the living-room setting wasn't right. He sat cross-legged on a small couch in his one-bedroom apartment, a temporary dwelling in the midtown hotel-condominium that he shares with his mother, Susan Kraus, and his 4-year-old brother, Danny.</p><p>It was early afternoon, and Jonny had just awakened. He wore a black "Ren and Stimpy Show" T-shirt. The television show is one of his favorites, along with "Saturday Night Live," of which he dreams of being the host, or at least, said his mother, playing Church Lady.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Sounds like a pretty good life, this playing in "Falsettos": you get up at noon, there's no school, and before you go to bed at night, about 800 people stand and applaud you.</p><p>"That's the life of an actor," Jonny explained, his round glasses glinting under a lamp. He spoke not as if it was old hat, but as if it was, well, new hat, as New York itself is for him. "It's been fun," Jonny added, but not perfect. "I do have to do schoolwork, even if I don't go to school."</p><p>His mother, a non-practicing lawyer, teaches him humanities at home, and he's tutored in math backstage at the John Golden Theater on West 45th Street, where "Falsettos" is playing. It is an abrupt change from just a few months ago, when Jonny was in the sixth grade at Collins Elementary School in his hometown of Cupertino, Calif., just outside San Jose.</p><p>In fact, becoming Jason, the 12-year-old character he plays in "Falsettos," has been quite a transition, as well. Jason, it seems, has undergone considerably more emotional change than Jonny has. Jason, for example, learns that his father is leaving his mother -- for a man. "I feel sorry for Jason," said Jonny, "because all of a sudden his family is breaking up and he's really confused. He doesn't know who to love. I'm not like him one bit. Even though half my family's here and half is in California, we're still together."</p><p>While his mother and brother have accompanied Jonny to New York, his father, Jonathan, a vice president of sales for a company that stores business records, and Jonny's sister, Katherine, 10, remain in California.</p><p>For Jason, "Falsettos" is about coming to terms with the turmoil in his family, as he grows to love and admire his father's boyfriend, the macho Whizzer, who is dying of an unnamed disease.</p><p>"It's about family and life, love and sex," said Jonny, sounding as if he was reading the lines of a television commercial he sang for the show. Just then, Danny entered the room, singing those same lines, though "sex" came out "six." He got the laugh he had anticipated, though probably not for the reasons he thought.</p><p>The theater experience for Jonny, meanwhile, has opened to him "a world of ideas," his mother said. "Jonny's made some friends who are gay, but I don't think he thinks about it. He's like Jason -- he likes or doesn't like the person for what he is."</p><p>Jonny said he believed that Keith David, from "Jelly's Last Jam," or Scott Waara, from "The Most Happy Fella," would win the Tony on Sunday for the category in which he is nominated, "because they're great and because they've been around Broadway longest." He added, "Some people say I have a chance to win, but I don't know if they're just pulling my leg."</p><p>Like who?</p><p>"Like Michael Rupert," Jonny said. (Mr. Rupert, who plays Jason's father in "Falsettos," has also received a Tony nomination, for leading actor in a musical.) "He's always joking with me. Michael told me, 'When you go up to accept your award, remember me.' He said he didn't expect to win. But I don't think anyone could be better than him."</p><p>The reviews for Jonny have been glowing. How did he feel being referred to as sage? Jonny looked at his mother, seated on a chair, for help.</p><p>"Do you know what sage means, Jonny?" she asked.</p><p>"Un-unh," he said.</p><p>"Sage means wise," she said. "It's also an herb you put in soup."</p><p>"Oh," he said. "I'm good for soup?"</p><p>And how, he was asked, does he keep from getting a swelled head from all this attention?</p><p>He looked again for assistance. "Mom?" he said.</p><p>"One thing is Danny," she said. "Jonny's other full-time job is trying to keep Danny out of trouble." Jonny nodded and directed his attention toward Danny's video game, which the small boy held up as he leaned on Jonny's knee, insisting he play with him.</p><p>"The barber we go to asked Danny what he liked best about New York," Jonny said, smiling. "And he answered, 'The cockroaches!' "</p><p>Perhaps Jonny's most down-to-earth influence is his mother. She seems no typical stage mother. While he earns a little more than the Broadway actor's minimum wage of $900 a week, she has him on an allowance of $10 a week (the rest is divided among the rent in New York, the agent's fee and a college trust for him).</p><p>"The allowance is up from $5 a week -- which is what he got before he was a big Broadway star," she said. The words "big Broadway star" were expressed with proper irony, which wasn't lost on Jonny.</p>                </div>
