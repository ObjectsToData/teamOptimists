One shot: that's all any of them want -- players, refs, coaches. When one succeeds, it opens the door just a bit wider for the rest.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"I think he's made up his mind this time," she said of Daniels, putting down the newspaper.  "That's 90 percent of the struggle."</p><p>Ortiz-Del Valle made up her mind 14 years ago that she wanted to be an N.B.A. referee. After an outstanding basketball career at City College, she began a torturous climb as an official that included countless hours of work in summer leagues, developmental programs and finally elevation in 1984 to the nationwide pro-am circuit.</p><p>Last year she received her first major breakthrough when Terry Fiorito, the supervisor of officials for the U.S.B.L., hired her. On July 15, she became the first woman to referee a men's professional basketball game and later was selected to work the U.S.B.L. championship series. During eight seasons, she has paid her dues, taken the abuse, heard all the cracks about how she should be home having babies. She has gone to clinics, studied films, handed out technical fouls.</p><p>Fiorito said he thought that at this point, Del Valle was ready for the N.B.A. She has reached that critical point in her career, however, where talent and skill have taken her as far as she can go.</p><p>If 90 percent of success is drive and determination, the other 10 percent depends on good fortune and, in this case, the willingness of the N.B.A. to break tradition by allowing a female referee to share the court.</p><p>Ortiz-Del Valle has not spoken directly to Darrell Garretson, the N.B.A.'s supervisor of officials. But in addition to hearing compliments, she has heard about concerns from unnamed sources: does a woman have the stamina, will a woman be intimidated, can a woman know the subtleties?</p><p>Isn't it odd how, in each decade, someone plays the role of Jackie Robinson, making the same pioneering pleas for equal opportunity? How someone plays the role of Dixie Walker, making outrageous arguments in favor of maintaining the status quo? And how someone plays the role of Branch Rickey, deciding that fair play must prevail?</p><p>Here we are, in the foyer of the 21st century, and there are reservations about whether a woman has the skill and courage to call fouls on men.</p><p>At the same time, there is a double standard, particularly at the college level, in which men can officiate men's and women's games, but women can officiate only women's games; men can coach men and women in Division I, but women can coach only women.</p><p>This has been a continuing problem, not just of numbers but of perception. While the N.B.A. is making strides in hiring women, the women associated with all the major pro sports are still largely cast as cheerleaders, groupies or fans. Not referees or umpires.</p><p>Until 1977, women covering major league baseball were not permitted to enter clubhouses. It took a lawsuit by Melissa Ludtke, a staff member of Sports Illustrated, to force major league baseball to open the clubhouse to all journalists. Ludtke will be honored in New York this evening by the Association for Women in Sports Media, a group that has grown from a handful in 1987 to 500 members.</p><p>Women possess an array of skills and talents that can be employed within the sports industry, but there continues to be a persistent inertia that resists changes in prescribed roles.</p><p>"There are coaches who feel they have to play a father-figure role," Ortiz-Del Valle said. "For some, maybe I remind them of their girlfriends -- or ex-girlfriends.</p><p>"We have to get to a point where people can look beyond gender and see skill. All I want them to see is a competent, dedicated referee who loves the game as much as they do."</p><p>Photo: Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle at school.
