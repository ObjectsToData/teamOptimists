With the new emphasis on multicultural and global perspectives in the curriculum, many districts are looking for innovative and inexpensive ways to expand their students' horizons.

                    <p>Through the Language Culture Assistants program, which started with West Germany in 1984, schools can obtain the services of a teacher from Spain, China, Germany or Italy from October through the end of the academic year. The program is run under the auspices of the State Education Department's Center for Multinational and Comparative Education in Albany, which works with education ministries in other countries to place interns as teaching assistants in foreign-language programs.</p><p>While the foreign ministries pay the interns a modest monthly stipend, the amount of which varies from country to county, participating districts provide housing with a host family, transportation to and from school and lunch during school hours.</p><p>The teachers, who are generally 23 through 30 years old, have received teaching degrees and licenses in their home countries, usually as English teachers. Most have previously spent at least a year or two in charge of their own classrooms and see the chance to come to America as an opportunity to enhance their conversational skills and immerse themselves in American culture.</p><p>"There's a two-fold purpose to this program," said Amy B. Theobald, an education specialist at the Center for Multinational and Comparative Education. "These people who are young and have got teaching degrees can try out teaching in another setting and improve their skills." For the schools, it's an authentic resource that comes into the classroom.</p><p>There are 18 foreign teacher interns in 16 school districts in the state. Two teachers from Spain have been assigned to Westchester: one to Pleasantville High School and the other to Valhalla Middle and High School. The experience is educational for the interns and schools alike. Valuable Opportunity</p><p>For Miss Gonzalez, a 26-year-old native of Palencia (a small city north of Madrid) who is working in the Valhalla school, the opportunity to teach basic Spanish as well as advanced conversational Spanish offers a professional benefit that she said she expected to pay off when she returns to Spain.</p><p>"I feel to be a good teacher in Spain, I have to really know the language," said Miss Gonzalez, who had also participated in a similar program in Northern Ireland. "English is really important in Spain. I am very interested in other countries' cultures and customs."</p><p>During her beginning Spanish classes in Valhalla, she plays games that introduce seventh- and eighth-grade students to Spanish money, or she conducts guessing games in which students identify various objects in the classroom. "I try to prepare different things, to reinforce what they have been doing," Miss Gonzalez said. Differences With Spain</p><p>She has found many differences between the American and Spanish systems, especially in the level of student involvement in the school as well as academic preparation. "In general, the academic level is higher in Spain," Miss Gonzalez said. "Teachers' expectations are higher in Spain and are harder on the students. American teachers reinforce students with a positive attitude while in Spain the teachers are very negative. Students here are much more involved with the schools, in having activities. In Spain, students want to forget school when classes are finished."</p><p>For 26-year-old Maria Aranzazu Odriozola, a native of Ordizia, Spain, a small town on the border with France, working in Pleasantville has clearly expanded her own professional horizons. "At home, the teacher changes rooms," Miss Odriozola said. "Here, the students change rooms. In Spain, the principal has to teach and teachers have to be counselors. I don't like to do that. Here, the students have a much bigger choice of subjects. We have nothing like the extracurricular activities they have here. I really like that about the schools here."</p><p>Miss Odriozola, who had also spent a year teaching in Scotland, said she was impressed by the congenial environment at Pleasantville and her affable colleagues. "They are very open minded, and everybody talks to me," she said. "It's not the idea I had about America. I thought people would be more reserved, but I'm surprised at how friendly people are."</p>                </div>
