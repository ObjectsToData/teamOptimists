I miss the world.&quot;   The principal characters -- although there are many others -- are Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century English minister to the Court of Naples; his wife, Emma, and Horatio Lord Nelson, England's most revered naval hero, whose love affair with Emma became as famous as his impressive victories over Napoleon. Under the title (which refers to Hamilton's obsession with Mount Vesuvius), Sontag has appended the words, &quot;A Romance.&quot;">

"It was like taking a beloved person to the airport and returning to an empty house," she says softly, intensely, during a recent interview in her New York apartment. "I miss the people.

Under the title (which refers to Hamilton's obsession with Mount Vesuvius), Sontag has appended the words, "A Romance."</p><p>A romance by the author of "Against Interpretation," "Styles of Radical Will," "Death Kit" and "AIDS and Its Metaphors"? A romance by the intellectual champion of modernism; the eloquent admirer of Roland Barthes, Elias Canetti, Antonin Artaud?</p><p>"In order to find the courage to write this book, it helped me to find a label that allowed me to go over the top," she explains. "The word 'romance' was like a smile. Also, the novel becomes such a self-conscious enterprise for people who read a lot. You want to do something that takes into account all the options you have in fiction. Yet you don't want to be writing    about    fiction, but making fiction. So I sprang myself from fictional self-consciousness by saying, It's a novel -- it's more than a novel -- it's a romance!" She opens her arms and laughs un-self-consciously. "And I fell into the book like Alice in Wonderland. For three years, I worked 12 hours a day in a delirium of pleasure. This novel is really a turning point for me."</p>                </div>

                    <p>At 59, she has already had a remarkable career. Although she has written fiction, two plays and four films, she is primarily known for her learned and startling essays. Dealing from a seemingly limitless store of knowledge, she has examined the 20th century from widely divergent points of reference, like literature, painting, illness, photography, philosophy, pornography, film, sociology, anthropology, communism and fascism. Having lived for long periods in France and Italy, conversant in three languages (translated into 23), she is a true polymath internationalist.</p><p>Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican novelist and man of letters, and another writer who straddles many cultures, compares her to Erasmus, the greatest humanist of the Renaissance: "This is one of the worst-informed eras in history, just like the beginning of the 15th century. Countries are ignorant about each other. And, like Erasmus, exactly when it is needed, Susan Sontag is a communicator in this broken-down world. Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing. Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate. She is unique."</p><p>As she sits in her kitchen, she does have the air of one who has wrestled prodigiously, and over a considerable lifetime, with essential questions. Wrinkles and creases run wild on her unadorned face. Her skin is as pale as a monk's. Her long, unruly, onyx-black hair is rent by a dramatic slash of pure white that runs like an ice flow over the crest of her head. But her candid expression, her round dark eyes that fill easily with tears, her frequent laughter and her deep, vibrant voice suggest the eagerness and avidity of a seeker; a curiously timeworn child who needs a bit more sleep.</p><p>"I think I've always wanted to write this book," she is saying. "I'm glad to be free of the kind of one-note depressiveness that is so characteristic of contemporary fiction. I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel.  I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says be serious, be passionate, wake up."</p><p>"The Volcano Lover" anatomizes immense varieties of passionate engagement. Hamilton loves abjectly not only his art collection, which he continually augments, but Vesuvius, his beloved volcano, whose threats and displays of destructive energy hold him in permanent thrall.  He loves Emma as a connoisseur loves a Leonardo, with cultivated, refined appreciation.</p><p>Enter Nelson, the man of action, the genuine hero, and another sort of passion is ignited in Emma, which relegates Hamilton, the expert on nature's power, to the status of outsider in the drama of human forces unleashed under his own roof. And then there are the passions of revolution and an epic array of 18-century follies engendered by romantic dreams of reason.</p><p>SONTAG, HERSELF, IS A hybrid of reason and romance. One need only peruse the vast library in her airy five-room apartment for confirmation. An intellectual who studies the history of ideas might have many books. But only a person intemperately in love with reading possesses 15,000.</p><p>"I'm an addicted reader," she says, "a hedonist. I'm led by my passions. It's a kind of greed, in a way." She laughs happily. "I like to be surrounded by things that speak to me and uplift me."</p><p>I ask how the books are arranged.</p><p>"Ahhh. By subject or, in the case of literature, by language and chronologically. The 'Beowulf' to Virginia Woolf principle. I'll show you."</p><p>"Nothing is alphabetical?"</p><p>"I know people who have a lot of books. Richard Howard, for instance. He does his books alphabetically, and that sets my teeth on edge. I couldn't put Pynchon next to Plato! It doesn't make sense."</p>                </div>
