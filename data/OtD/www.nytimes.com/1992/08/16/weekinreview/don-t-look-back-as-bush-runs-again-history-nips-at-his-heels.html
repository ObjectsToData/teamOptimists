                    <p>LOOKING backward is the last thing President Bush wants to do at the Republican National Convention in Houston this week -- for two reasons. Politically, the clear plan for his campaign is to emphasize the future, to nod to the past only to suggest that the next four years will have domestic success to rival the foreign policy triumphs of the last four.</p><p>As James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State, proclaimed as he prepared to leave his second Cabinet office for his fourth Bush Presidential campaign, "It's now time to turn to new challenges." He said that from now on "President Bush will target America."</p><p>Nor would a longer look back, at other campaigns for re-election to the Presidency, do much for the candidate's morale. The depressing message of history is that when Presidents have run to retain the White House in circumstances like Mr. Bush's, they have lost far more often than they have won.</p><p>It is deceptive to recall landslide re-elections from Franklin D. Roosevelt's to Ronald Reagan's, and to conclude from them that there is something normal about eight years in the White House, something extraordinary about denying a President a second term. It may be natural enough; most of the losers were not very memorable Presidents. After all, who spends much time thinking about the accomplishments of one-termers like Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison or even William Howard Taft?</p>                </div>

                    <p>In fact, there have been periods when re-election was the norm, and others when it was extraordinary.</p><p>In the earliest days of the Republic, five of the first seven Presidents were re-elected, and without much trouble at that. That changed in 1840, when Van Buren, a Democrat, was defeated by William Henry Harrison. Starting in that year, party strengths were closely matched. So, except for the special circumstances of the Civil War, which accounted for two terms each for Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, no one won a second term until 1900.</p><p>The 1840 election has some similarities to this year's. It was held in a lingering depression. The Whigs spurned their old contenders like Daniel Webster and Henry Clay and picked a new face. It was the first election dominated by gimmicks, songs and slogans, like "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too," and the meanest slur against the incumbent -- the Whigs chanted "Van, Van, a Used-Up Man" -- is not all that different from some of today's gibes at Mr. Bush.</p><p>One mistake the Republicans seem determined not to replicate is the one Van Buren made in looking backward to his patron, Andrew Jackson, and especially to his old issues. Of course, today the Republicans may occasionally raise old issues out of habit. Their party chairman, Richard N. Bond, last week managed to make up for the absence of Soviet Communists from the scene by accusing Bill Clinton of planning to invite Fidel Castro to a state dinner.</p><p>It is not easy to red-bait without Reds. One can expect Mr. Baker to change that, fast, and to see that the campaign looks forward, not back. Of course, this century's elections are more prominent in the minds of candidates and their handlers. And re-elections have been frequent. From 1932 to 1974, there was only one President, John F. Kennedy, who did not take the oath of office at least twice.</p><p>But the two-term norm may be over. Prof. Joel H. Silbey of Cornell University thinks that is changing again, with one-term Presidents likely except in cases of exceptional personalities, like Reagan's.</p><p>It is not just the decline of parties that he sees as responsible, though that matters, but also the gap between hopes and reality: "Nobody can be a hero for very long. Today we have such a negative attitude toward government, contrasted with such high expectations that no one can succeed."</p><p>Still, nobody, least of all Mr. Bush, is going to assume that incumbents cannot be re-elected. At worst, they might agree that it will be harder. And there are plenty of past examples to look to. This is the 19th Presidential election of this century, and the 15th in which an incumbent was running. Many of them were elected to new terms easily. William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, F.D.R. (three times), Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Reagan all had little trouble.</p><p>But not in their wildest dreams do Republicans think Mr. Bush will have an easy victory. So the other five races may have more parallels to today, for in each case the incumbent faced a tough fight. Mr. Taft lost when the Ross Perot of his day, former President Theodore Roosevelt, ran as a third-party candidate and split the Republican vote in 1912. Woodrow Wilson squeaked through in 1916 as the peace candidate, with the Republicans still embittered and divided.</p><p>Harry S. Truman ran the classic comeback in 1948. He campaigned nonstop, attacking Republicans and proposing programs of his own, while the Republicans took victory for granted in 1948. Mr. Bush may follow his example and condemn the "do-nothing 102d Congress," but he cannot count on Mr. Clinton's loafing through October the way Thomas E. Dewey did.</p>                </div>
