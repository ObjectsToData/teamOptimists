                    <p>When Denise Galarza Sepulveda told her high school guidance counselor that she dreamed of one day teaching at a university, the counselor looked at her and rolled her eyes.</p><p>Ms. Galarza Sepulveda had good grades, but she was the only Puerto Rican in her class. Her guidance counselor had approached other, nonminority, students and suggested they apply to college. With deadlines looming, Ms. Galarza Sepulveda asked for an appointment and offered up her dreams.</p><p>"That's all she did, then just silence," Ms. Galarza Sepulveda said, recalling her counselor rolling her eyes. "I don't even know how I managed to leave the room. I felt like crying. Actually, I did go to the bathroom and just started crying, because I felt completely worthless." An Oft-Told Tale</p><p>Her tale of a put-down of academic ambitions is one told by black, Hispanic and American Indian students around the country. All too often, they say, they are discouraged from believing they can succeed in intellectually demanding professions. For example, Guy Bluford, the first black astronaut, was told by a high school adviser that he was only smart enough for trade school.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Minorities are particularly scarce among teachers and Ph.D.'s. Of the 24,721 Ph.D. degrees awarded to Americans last year, blacks received 993, Hispanic Americans 708 and American Indians 128. Eight percent of public school teachers are black and 3 percent Hispanic American in the country at large, although in large cities the percentages are higher. In New York City, 19.2 percent of the public school teachers are black and 10.2 percent are Hispanic.</p><p>Ms. Galarza Sepulveda eventually found a sympathetic teacher who guided her through the maze of college applications, and now attends the University of Connecticut.</p><p>But experiences like hers suggest that the scarcity of black and Hispanic teachers and professors is not only a matter of finding enough money for advanced degrees, or of navigating a complex application process to graduate school. Minority students' confidence has also been undermined by years of assumptions that because they are not white they are not smart enough to make it.</p><p>What college students like Lisette Nieves say they hear is, "You don't have that 'thought gene.' "</p><p>Ms. Nieves did not let such discouraging words deter her from becoming the first Rhodes Scholar from Brooklyn College. This July, she joined more than 40 other minority college students, graduate students and professors in a program that aims to send a different message -- that they have the brains for graduate school and that they are not alone.</p><p>The program, the Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers, brings promising college students to the campus of Phillips Academy here for four weeks of study, guides them through graduate school applications and continues to monitor them once they enter graduate school.</p><p>The program is one of several designed to swell the ranks of minority teachers and Ph.D.'s. There are many reasons for the shortages. Talented students often choose better-paying jobs in law or business, partly because many minority students are saddled with huge loan repayments for their college education. Many students do not even consider graduate school and have no one in their families or neighborhoods who can guide them.</p><p>But students also talk of being pushed aside, discouraged from intellectual pursuits by people blinded by the color of their skin.</p><p>Jeffrey L. Pegram recalls a guidance counselor who told him he was only good enough to get into a two-year college -- this to a student whose high grades put him on the dean's list three years in a row.</p><p>"Out of 2,000 students, I was one of five Native Americans, and we found out that this guidance counselor had told a lot of people of color that they should go into the Army or a two-year school," said Mr. Pegram, who graduated this year from the University of Massachusetts and wants to study American Indian history.</p><p>This sometimes unspoken, sometimes brazen message is one familiar to experts who work with minority college students.</p><p>"I hear examples from students coming from high schools all the time," said Freeman Hrabowski 3d, interim president of the University of Maryland Baltimore County. "Sometimes we say so much without ever using words. We can discourage a student in so many ways."</p><p>Mr. Hrabowski directs the university's Meyerhoff Scholars program, which seeks to encourage black students to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering. The program was founded by Robert Meyerhoff, a Baltimore philanthropist.</p><p>For all the slights and barriers, students are also quick to praise those who believed in them and helped them believe in themselves.</p><p>"My guidance counselor spoon-fed me through the application process," said Ray Blakeney, a senior at the University of Dayton in Ohio whose father is black and mother is Korean. "People are out there who really want to help. A lot of time people tend to focus on the negative and don't realize the positive."</p><p>But the wounds linger for many students. Gonzalo Zeballos still stiffens when he tells what happened after he was admitted to the honors program at the College of the Holy Cross: "One of my closest friends said, 'You're just the token minority.'
