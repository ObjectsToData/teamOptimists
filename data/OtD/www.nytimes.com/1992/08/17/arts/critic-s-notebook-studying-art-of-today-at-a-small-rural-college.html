    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Last spring Bard College, 90 miles north of New York City in rural Dutchess County, completed the first phase of establishing a pioneering graduate program devoted exclusively to the study of contemporary art and culture. The program was conceived by Bard's president, Leon Botstein, and carried out largely by two benefactors, Richard Black, a businessman, and his wife, Marieluise. The Blacks not only put their own sizable collection of contemporary art on permanent loan to Bard as a research collection for the program, but also financed the construction of a 38,000-square-foot building to house it.    The building, the Richard and Marieluise Black Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, was dedicated last April at an international gathering of figures from the art world.">

                    <p>Last spring Bard College, 90 miles north of New York City in rural Dutchess County, completed the first phase of establishing a pioneering graduate program devoted exclusively to the study of contemporary art and culture. The program was conceived by Bard's president, Leon Botstein, and carried out largely by two benefactors, Richard Black, a businessman, and his wife, Marieluise. The Blacks not only put their own sizable collection of contemporary art on permanent loan to Bard as a research collection for the program, but also financed the construction of a 38,000-square-foot building to house it.</p><p>The building, the Richard and Marieluise Black Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, was dedicated last April at an international gathering of figures from the art world.</p><p>With the festivities long over, however, the complexities of the undertaking are becoming apparent. The physical plant, while still largely unoccupied, appears to be a success. The building, designed by James Goettsch and Nada Andric, is a low-lying, bunkerlike structure of light gray stone set in a meadow on Bard's campus. Equipped with offices, classrooms, a library and a planned ultra-modern electronic publishing system for the production of exhibition catalogues, the building has more than 10,000 feet of exhibition space and 8,000 feet of storage for the research collection.</p><p>Sixty-seven works, or about one-tenth of the collection, are on view in the center's opening show, which runs through Sept. 30 on the campus, in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Titled "Passions and Cultures" and organized by Mrs. Black, the exhibition is arranged more or less by period and style: A room each is devoted to Minimalism, Arte Povera, Neo-Expressionist painting and more recent photo-derived art. The work on view is exclusively Western, and predominantly American and German. Piece by piece, the paintings and sculptures tend to be characteristic rather than exemplary samples of their creators' signature output, with some artists (Julian Schnabel and David Salle, for example) caught well below par.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Minimalist selection, which includes pieces by Donald Judd, Agnes Martin and Robert Ryman, holds no surprises, and the same may be said of the Arte Povera group, though it is good to see four Jannis Kounellis pieces interacting in an intimate space. Since almost everything here (like the collection as a whole) dates from after 1980, the opportunity for historical layering is, at this point, slight.</p><p>Categorical strictures loosen up a bit in the third room and one gets a sense of how the diverse elements of the collection may be made to interact in provocative ways. The idea of nature and the natural is the thematic focus here, with Neil Jenny's "Atmosphere," a painting of a cloudless sky, set between Richard Long's mound of white granite rocks and one of Joseph Beuys's blackboards covered with childlike chalk drawings. The implication of the organic and the primitive in these works is neatly subverted by Tony Cragg's "David," a collage version of Michelangelo's heroic sculpture made entirely of tiny white-painted plastic forms -- cigarette lighters, eyeglass frames, combs -- affixed to the wall.</p><p>The unified stylistic front displayed by the Neo-Expressionist paintings in the next room serves to throw the pluralist approach of the later 1980's into relief. This diversity is represented, however, by too-predictable inclusions -- one of Jenny Holzer's inscribed benches, a minor Barbara Kruger text piece -- and confirms certain general impressions given by the collection itself.</p><p>By far the most exciting attraction is a small side gallery show of works on paper by the Mexican artists Nahum B. Zenil and German Venegas, which were fierce and challenging on every level.</p><p>Equally challenging, at least in the abstract, is the center's proposed academic program. It is based upon the interdisciplinary approach that has dominated art studies for the last decade. The center's director, Norton Batkin, says faculty members and students will be drawn from music, literature, sociology, cultural history and philosophy, as well as from the visual arts. Yet it is in the visual arts that its focus lies.</p><p>The program, as Mr. Batkin describes it, will concentrate on art from the mid-1960's onward, examining the role of art criticism and its effect on art production and audience response. It will also consider the sociological implications of art exhibition. The center will offer a Master of Arts degree to its graduates (although as of this summer, state accreditation to confer the degree is still pending).</p><p>There is no question that the Black Center has the potential to be a valuable and possibly ground-breaking extension of existing programs in museum studies, and it could serve as a laboratory for sorting out which new approaches to its subject are viable and which are not. But certain practical matters crucial to the center's fitness for these tasks have yet to be resolved.</p><p>Although the center plans to use a rotating, nontenured visiting faculty, no names, not even for the opening semester next year, have been decided on. The presence of a more permanent faculty to provide continuity and guide students through the academic year is also promised, but the members and their exact functions are uncertain. With no faculty in place, the center's curriculum itself is, at this point, up for grabs, as are the criteria to be used in admitting students. If an undergraduate concentration in art will not be required for admission, will there be a prerequisite of some quantifiable degree of exposure to art before a student can begin studies? If so, what will it be, and if not, how will a common, working language be established among the participants?</p><p>As currently formulated, the Bard program is based on what is becoming a classic post-modernist academic paradox. In principle, all approaches to the study of art are admissible. In reality, those approaches can only bear fruit if the existing body of historical material has been fully absorbed. This kind of knowledge-in-depth is likely to be especially necessary to a program whose primary focus is on that least understood of all periods, the recent past.</p><p>With many academic institutions cutting back relentlessly in the humanities, it is good to see Bard taking a leap forward. But some hard thinking about the curatorial studies program is needed at this planning stage if it is to land squarely on its feet a year from September.</p><p>Photo: Norton Batkin, director of the Richard and Marieluise Black Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, said the center's proposed academic program would be based upon an interdisciplinary approach. He gave one of the candidates for the faculty a tour of the center. (Susan Harris for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
