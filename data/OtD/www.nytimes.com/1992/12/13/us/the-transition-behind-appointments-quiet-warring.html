Summers for a top economics job, and of John Young, a business executive who was once the leading candidate for Commerce Secretary. And it is endangering the chances of others.</p><p>A flavor of this combat was given by one potential candidate, who said he received an anonymous phone call on Election Day on his home answering machine.</p><p>"You don't know me," the voice said, "but I know your work and I was flying on the shuttle between New York and Washington today, and someone sitting just behind me was doing business very loudly on the airplane phone and you were the subject."

                    <p>The Clinton prospect, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the caller then revealed that the man behind him on the plane was organizing a meeting of interest groups to plot a blocking action against the appointment and signed off: "I thought you'd like to know."</p><p>This sort of competition for jobs takes place with every Administration but seems particularly intense this season. Not only are Democrats all pushing to the fore at once, having been out of power for 12 years; different ideological wings of the party that banded together to elect Mr. Clinton are now redrawing old battle lines. Moreover, interest groups have proliferated since the last time the Democrats took the Presidency, 16 years ago.</p><p>In the spirit of the times, The New Republic has taken to running a series of articles not on people who are getting jobs but on those the authors hope will not. The column, "Hit List," has featured Paula Stern, the trade lawyer and lobbyist; Mickey Kantor, who was Mr. Clinton's campaign manager; Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, and Robert Reich, who was named Friday to head the Department of Labor. The magazine's editor, Martin Peretz, says he is now receiving phone calls from Clinton hopefuls lobbying not to be mentioned.</p><p>One of the first people to find himself in the gun sights of ideological opponents was Joshua Muravchik, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who contributed to Mr. Clinton's human rights platform during the campaign. Mr. Muravchik is said to be a candidate for Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights.</p><p>But as a prominent member of the circle of "neo-conservative" thinkers during the cold war, Mr. Muravchik was at odds with some human rights groups, notably Americas Watch, over his emphasis on defeating communism as the primary goal of human-rights efforts. He had argued that the most important human rights issue was defeating communism, because nothing would liberate more people; his opponents argued that while the cold war was crucial, so were human rights abuses by America's allies. Letter of Disapproval</p><p>Several such groups sent a joint letter three weeks ago to Mr. Clinton's transition office titled "Criteria for Assistant Secretary for Human Rights," which those familiar with the issue say was aimed against conservatives like Mr. Muravchik.</p><p>The letter, drafted by a board member of Amnesty International and first published by the weekly journal Jewish Forward, said, among other things, that "The candidate must not have been previously associated with the defense of abusive governments" and must demonstrate "commitment to a single standard for fundamental human rights reporting."</p><p>Asked for his reaction, Mr. Muravchik said: "Between me and some of these people there was a lot of antagonistic history that had to do with the cold war. But the cold war is over. And I think that the whole significance of the Clinton campaign was that it got us beyond these old fights. If these people were looking forward instead of backward they would understand that we now have a lot in common: insuring that human rights remains on the front burner of American foreign policy."</p><p>Another increasingly active foreign policy interest group is the Jewish Peace Lobby, which is eager to make sure that no Clinton Middle East advisers are drawn from the ranks of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a more conservative lobby known as Aipac. Aipac in recent years tilted in favor of the right-wing Likud Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and has been pushing its own favorite appointees.</p><p>The Jewish Peace Lobby sent Mr. Clinton's transition team a letter describing its criteria for the ideal Middle East advisers. "What he must avoid," the letter said, "are appointees closely associated with groups that blindly supported the Shamir government, and analysts who crossed over into advocacy for the positions of the Likud."</p><p>On a different front, The Washington Blade, a newspaper aimed at gay readers, broke the story two weeks ago that Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had asked two aides a decade ago to give up their high security jobs because of their homosexuality.</p>                </div>
