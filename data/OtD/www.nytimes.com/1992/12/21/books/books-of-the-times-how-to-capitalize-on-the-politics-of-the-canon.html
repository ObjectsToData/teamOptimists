Norton &amp; Company.</p><p>As the battle of the books rages on, and conservatives and innovators threaten to pound each other into a paper pulp, Gerald Graff, a professor of English and education at the University of Chicago, proposes an intriguing solution in his new book, "Beyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conflicts Can Revitalize American Education."</p><p>Instead of trying to suppress the debate between, say, the multi-culturalists and those who would uphold the mainstream, why not bring the conflict out into the open where students can see it? Instead of continuing to argue over whether, say, Matthew Arnold's poem "Dover Beach" casts women in an inferior role, why not teach the conflict itself?</p><p>Why not hold symposiums that would put on display not only teachers, but even entire departments contending with one another, as has already been tried in several experimental curriculums? Have the students write papers on what happened. Maybe even test them on who said what. Why not even let teachers expose their research to public debate? In the old days, when such research was narrow and specialized, it might have had "little to contribute to general education or even to the undergraduate major." But this is no longer the case. "The humanities would hardly be the cultural and political battleground they have become today if pedantic specialization were still the first order in its research."</p>                </div>

                    <p>After all, he points out, although Americans try to hide their obsession with class conflict, this country loves a good contest. Students are no different. And under the present system, with its refusal to acknowledge conflict, students are being hurt. They must learn to think one way for some teachers and the opposite way for others. Moreover, Mr. Graff concludes, the culture wars are deep and real. They are not going to be resolved. They are not going to go away.</p><p>It is to this last point, the profundity of the culture wars, that Mr. Graff devotes much of his book, and this makes him sound like a radical at times. To a neo-conservative like Allan Bloom, who argued in "The Closing of the American Mind" that a good book teaches itself, Mr. Graff responds that Mr. Bloom violated his own dictate, that "in using Plato and Dante to attack the intellectual and educational trends of his own time, Bloom is not reading these writers as they wished to be read but is    applying    them to a set of contexts they did not and could not have anticipated."</p><p>To those who argue that the demand for diversification of the traditional canon is a departure in American education, Mr. Graff responds by saying, Nonsense! The introduction of multi-cultural texts is simply another in a series of steps that saw Greek and Latin classics give way to English literature, which in turn was pushed aside by American literature, which in turn was overthrown by modern literature, which is now being usurped by pop literature. The point was always to engage a new class of students.</p><p>Moreover, he argues, such increasingly accessible material has not diminished the challenge of learning. It is not the text itself that makes for complexity. It is the questions you ask about the text, whether you are teaching Ovid, Oedipus or Olive Oyl.</p><p>Finally, to the traditionalists who claim to deplore politicizing the curriculum, he replies that to avoid the politics of art is also political.</p><p>All of this has been argued before, of course, some of it in Mr. Graff's previous books, "Professing Literature: An Institutional History," "Literature Against Itself: Literary Ideas in Modern Society" and "Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma." But in the present book, his point is never that one side or the other is right. It is merely that there's no denying the conflict, so one might as well take advantage of it.</p><p>One thread of the book that does seem cause for worry is the author's autobiographical account of how he came to feel the way he does about books and literature. He explains that as a child growing up in Chicago, he never read books because anyone who did was in danger of being called a sissy by the working-class children in his ethnically mixed neighborhood.  He felt this taboo so powerfully that he could not overcome his resistance to reading until his junior year in college, when he was exposed to conflicting interpretations of Mark Twain's classic "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." The debate over Twain's treatment of slavery gave him the beginning of a language with which to approach literature, he says. He is certain that other apathetic students can repeat his experience.</p><p>The difficulty with this account is that it doesn't make any connection between feeling sissyish about books and acquiring a tool for reading them, other than to present sissyishness as an obstacle to be overcome. You are left to wonder if the handicap persists and if Mr. Graff is capable of reading books for the stories they tell rather than the issues they raise. After all, in the greatest works of literary art, the political issues cancel one another out. What ultimately matters most is not whether their characters are black or white, male or female, imperialist or native, but whether they are human.</p><p>Almost as if to offset such concerns about his partisanship, Mr. Graff takes pains to reassure his readers about what is happening these days on campus. He shows that current horror stories of the extremes of political correctness are much exaggerated. And he writes that "one reason for the notorious difficulty of today's politically oriented criticism is its habit of going out of its way    not    to repeat the crudities perpetrated by the Marxists of the 1930's and the New Leftists of the 1960's, who often did reduce artworks to a mere 'reflection' of class interests and ideologies, praising or damning them accordingly."</p><p>The ultimate impression that "Beyond the Culture Wars" leaves is one of reasonableness and good sense. Instead of trying to resolve the battle of the books, it takes the ferocious energy of the conflict and, like a master of jujitsu, succeeds in redirecting it to a useful purpose.</p>                </div>
