    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  International A3-14  MANY DIVISIONS IN EUROPE  News analysis: A year after optimistically setting course for monetary union later in the decade, the 12-nation European Community is riven by economic, monetary and political divisions, raising doubts about whether it will ever become anything more than the single trading market that is due to take effect Jan. 1.  A1  GERMANY BACKS EUROPEAN UNITY  The German Parliament, warning that increased racial violence reflects the danger of resurgent nationalism, voted overwhelmingly to approve a treaty of European union, thus making Germany the ninth nation to ratify the treaty, which was agreed in the Dutch town of Maastricht a year ago.  A12  Germans ban the music of several neo-Nazi rock groups.  A12  U.S. BACKS U.N. SOMALIA ROLE  The United States has agreed to a significantly greater degree of United Nations involvement in the new military operation it wants the Security Council to authorize for Somalia later this week than it was prepared to accept two years ago in the Gulf war against Iraq.  A1  GAMBLE FOR TOURISTS IN AFRICA  A $300-million gamble, which opened as the Lost City in the South African homeland of Bophuthatswana, will offer tourists hotel and casino accommodations and a bit of fantasy about an Africa that is not quite so African.  A1  VENEZUELAN FEAR OF INSTABILITY  In the 1970's, highways and high-rises sprouted across Caracas, creating what Venezuelans proudly called a &quot;Miami with mountains.&quot; But the damage to this city's spirit is captured in a new phrase, as residents debate the country's future. A coup attempt last Friday failed, as did one in February. But the latest violence, in which 230 died, has confirmed Venezuelans' fears that their country has become dangerously unstable.  A3  Salvadoran rebels begin the destruction of their weapons.  A6  HONG KONG POWER STRUGGLE  News analysis: Asian wars have always been a bit odd, ever since the British invasions in the 19th century to force the Chinese to accept opium. Today's worsening conflict over Hong Kong is no exception. On the surface, the war of words between Britain and China over Hong Kong is about British efforts to make the territory a bit more democratic. But more fundamentally, the conflict is about power, mistrust and pride.  A7  Six U.N. peacekeepers are seized by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.  A11  As fighting raged in Sarajevo, efforts for food aid halted.  A5  Russian warns his country on runaway inflation.  A13  Israel seeks to lift ban on contacts with the P.L.O.  A9  National A16-22, B12-13  HEALTH INSURERS ASK OVERHAUL  The health insurance industry called for a Federal law that would bring coverage to all Americans, define a basic set of benefits and control costs by limiting tax breaks for insurance purchases.  A1  U.S. SUES TWO SALOMON OFFICIALS  After more than a year of inquiry into bond-market manipulation, the S.E.C. filed a civil suit charging two former managing directors of Salomon Brothers with insider trading and other securities violations.  A1  'TV WILL NEVER BE THE SAME'  Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cable television company, announced plans to introduce technology that could radically change the way people use TV.  A1  DECISION ON FOOD LABELING  Ending a long dispute between two Cabinet officers, the Administration announced rules intended to tell consumers the nutritional content of virtually every packaged food.  A1  'AN AMERICAN REUNION'  Aides to President-elect Clinton announced plans for what promises to be the most folksy inaugural celebration since Andrew Jackson threw open the White House doors in 1829 and was almost crushed by enthusiastic supporters.  A20  Matters abroad are now confronting Clinton squarely.  A20  Education groups are seeking common ground under Clinton.  A21  Kennebunkport Journal: A town fading from the spotlight.  A16  AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY  A researcher studying worms called nematodes has found that males live much shorter lives than females, and he has traced the difference to the act of making sperm. Other scientists, although cautious, now say it is possible that at least a fraction of the difference in life span between men and women may be linked to sperm production.  A18  THE SHUTTLE ROARS ALOFT  Discovery, carrying an intelligence satellite, soared into orbit on the last secret shuttle mission planned for the Pentagon.  A16  COLORADO UNDER FIRE  Anger over Colorado voters' passage of an anti-gay-rights measure has already cost the state's precious tourism industry millions of dollars, and the retribution shows no signs of abating quickly.A16  The Supreme Court heard an unlawful-taxation case.  A19  An abducted Mexican doctor went on trial in the Camarena slaying.  A17  The cost of the most expensive drug could be cut, a study found.

	data-description="  International A3-14  MANY DIVISIONS IN EUROPE  News analysis: A year after optimistically setting course for monetary union later in the decade, the 12-nation European Community is riven by economic, monetary and political divisions, raising doubts about whether it will ever become anything more than the single trading market that is due to take effect Jan. 1.  A1  GERMANY BACKS EUROPEAN UNITY  The German Parliament, warning that increased racial violence reflects the danger of resurgent nationalism, voted overwhelmingly to approve a treaty of European union, thus making Germany the ninth nation to ratify the treaty, which was agreed in the Dutch town of Maastricht a year ago.  A12  Germans ban the music of several neo-Nazi rock groups.  A12  U.S. BACKS U.N. SOMALIA ROLE  The United States has agreed to a significantly greater degree of United Nations involvement in the new military operation it wants the Security Council to authorize for Somalia later this week than it was prepared to accept two years ago in the Gulf war against Iraq.  A1  GAMBLE FOR TOURISTS IN AFRICA  A $300-million gamble, which opened as the Lost City in the South African homeland of Bophuthatswana, will offer tourists hotel and casino accommodations and a bit of fantasy about an Africa that is not quite so African.  A1  VENEZUELAN FEAR OF INSTABILITY  In the 1970's, highways and high-rises sprouted across Caracas, creating what Venezuelans proudly called a "Miami with mountains." But the damage to this city's spirit is captured in a new phrase, as residents debate the country's future. A coup attempt last Friday failed, as did one in February. But the latest violence, in which 230 died, has confirmed Venezuelans' fears that their country has become dangerously unstable.  A3  Salvadoran rebels begin the destruction of their weapons.  A6  HONG KONG POWER STRUGGLE  News analysis: Asian wars have always been a bit odd, ever since the British invasions in the 19th century to force the Chinese to accept opium. Today's worsening conflict over Hong Kong is no exception. On the surface, the war of words between Britain and China over Hong Kong is about British efforts to make the territory a bit more democratic. But more fundamentally, the conflict is about power, mistrust and pride.  A7  Six U.N. peacekeepers are seized by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.  A11  As fighting raged in Sarajevo, efforts for food aid halted.  A5  Russian warns his country on runaway inflation.  A13  Israel seeks to lift ban on contacts with the P.L.O.  A9  National A16-22, B12-13  HEALTH INSURERS ASK OVERHAUL  The health insurance industry called for a Federal law that would bring coverage to all Americans, define a basic set of benefits and control costs by limiting tax breaks for insurance purchases.  A1  U.S. SUES TWO SALOMON OFFICIALS  After more than a year of inquiry into bond-market manipulation, the S.E.C. filed a civil suit charging two former managing directors of Salomon Brothers with insider trading and other securities violations.  A1  'TV WILL NEVER BE THE SAME'  Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest cable television company, announced plans to introduce technology that could radically change the way people use TV.  A1  DECISION ON FOOD LABELING  Ending a long dispute between two Cabinet officers, the Administration announced rules intended to tell consumers the nutritional content of virtually every packaged food.  A1  'AN AMERICAN REUNION'  Aides to President-elect Clinton announced plans for what promises to be the most folksy inaugural celebration since Andrew Jackson threw open the White House doors in 1829 and was almost crushed by enthusiastic supporters.  A20  Matters abroad are now confronting Clinton squarely.  A20  Education groups are seeking common ground under Clinton.  A21  Kennebunkport Journal: A town fading from the spotlight.  A16  AN ASTONISHING DISCOVERY  A researcher studying worms called nematodes has found that males live much shorter lives than females, and he has traced the difference to the act of making sperm. Other scientists, although cautious, now say it is possible that at least a fraction of the difference in life span between men and women may be linked to sperm production.  A18  THE SHUTTLE ROARS ALOFT  Discovery, carrying an intelligence satellite, soared into orbit on the last secret shuttle mission planned for the Pentagon.  A16  COLORADO UNDER FIRE  Anger over Colorado voters' passage of an anti-gay-rights measure has already cost the state's precious tourism industry millions of dollars, and the retribution shows no signs of abating quickly.A16  The Supreme Court heard an unlawful-taxation case.  A19  An abducted Mexican doctor went on trial in the Camarena slaying.  A17  The cost of the most expensive drug could be cut, a study found.
