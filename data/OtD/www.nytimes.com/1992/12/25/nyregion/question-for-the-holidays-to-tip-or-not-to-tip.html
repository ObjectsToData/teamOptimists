But as Christmastime rolls around, many New Yorkers seeking to thank these same people on whose assistance they depend see only a bewildering blur of open palms.</p><p>Members of the city's service force, from doormen to exercise trainers, say that holiday tipping is a tradition that they have come to depend on. But for those expected to do the tipping, the season's ritual of outstretched hands and thinly veiled suggestions not only proves expensive, but confusing.</p><p>In a city like New York, a place in which even the slightest of wants and wishes are seldom repressed, tipping at Christmastime can be an especially demanding affair.</p><p>"There's always a little bit more tipping on Christmas, said Tom Sofia, owner of Peter J Hairtech in the West Village. "The good customers, the regular customers that you have been good to all year round, usually give you a $50 tip on Christmas."</p>                </div>

                    <p>But, he said, it is bad form to ask for a holiday tip.</p><p>"That's never done in the trade," Mr. Sofia said. Don't Be Bashful</p><p>Such reticence, however, does not apply to all trades.</p><p>An educator who lives in Brooklyn said his newspaper carrier is not very subtle. Every year, the carrier sends him a Christmas card that includes a self-addressed, unstamped envelope.</p><p>Besides the $10 tip, "I have to put a 29 cents stamp on the thing," said John Collett, a professor of humanities at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury.</p><p>In another instance, a 28-year-old elevator operator in a 78-unit residential building on West 106th Street said he expects nothing special. Yet many of his regular passengers discreetly slip him Christmas envelopes bearing tips from $5 to $175.</p><p>"People here have been really great," said John Graniela, who has been running the elevator for nine years. "I always give them a card but I don't expect anything. But anything is appreciated."</p><p>Service industry professionals and organizations say that holiday tipping is customary, and ranges from modest gifts like home-baked breads to as much as a worker's weekly salary, which is sometimes the case for cleaning help.</p><p>Doormen, for example, say they usually receive tips of from $10 to $30.</p><p>But the standard holiday tip structure is sometimes shattered by workers who campaign aggressively for a little something extra.</p><p>When Eugene Linden, a senior writer for Time magazine, drove into a Manhattan parking garage this week, he was surprised to see a large garland-trimmed chart mounted over the parking attendants' booth. Just above its colored lights the chart read: MERRY CHRISTMAS.</p><p>The chart listed some 70 names of the garage's regular customers, ranking them by the size of the Christmas tips they gave this year. The top quarter of the chart was colored green, denoting a class of customers that was particularly generous, one of the garage's attendants explained.</p><p>Mr. Linden, who came to New York from Boston, said he was not sure at first what he should give the attendants who had been parking his car since August. He said he had considered prorating the tip, but someone with more experience cautioned him that would not be a good idea.</p><p>"Since I would be in the garage all next year, I decided to go whole hog," Mr. Linden said. And prodded by the daily sight of the tipper's chart, Mr. Linden said he gave the attendants a $75 tip.</p><p>The tip propelled his name to the upper reaches of the chart, just shy of the green zone.</p><p>Besides another tip for his neighborhood cleaners -- on the counter a gift-wrapped box with a slot on top beckoned tips for "Mable and Jo Anne" -- Mr. Linden said he believed he got off reasonably well.</p><p>Dayo Babalola, an architect who lives 55 floors above midtown Manhattan in a chic, ultra-modern building on West 57th Street, said he did not know what his building's staff expected of him for Christmas.</p><p>A computer-generated Christmas card including all the staff's names, job titles and years of service was recently placed in his mailbox. And with his wife visiting her family overseas, the task of tipping, which was usually her job, was left to him.</p><p>"I bought a big cake for all of them," he said, noting that at the time he was pleased with the gesture.</p><p>But shortly after he delivered his gift yesterday, Mr. Babalola said he noticed a building employee with a gift bottle of Champagne.</p><p>"I felt kind of weird because I had just turned in my gift at the desk and then saw this beautiful bottle with a ribbon on it addressed to one person," he said. "I thought, should I give something to each individual?"</p><p>After a moment of introspection, Mr. Babalola decided that it really is the thought, not the gift, that counts. Besides, he said, he had only lived in the building less than two years and he is not as affluent as many of his neighbors.</p><p>"These people have served well all year," he said, adding that they never look for handouts. "I wish I could do more."</p><p>Photo: Although many members of New York's service force have come to depend on holiday tipping, the etiquette has become confusing for those expected to do the tipping.
