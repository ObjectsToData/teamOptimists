                    <p>A visitor to the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs or the Naval Academy comes away with a sense that these elite institutions, built on honor, duty and tradition, are grappling with change -- fearing for future careers while stubbornly confident that the armed forces will always rely on a core of leaders from their ranks.</p><p>Congress has ordered the Army, Navy and Air Force academies to shrink their enrollments by 10 percent by 1995, to 4,000 students each, to conform to personnel cuts in the armed forces.</p><p>And two Congressional agencies have questioned the value of the Pentagon's spending $650 million a year on institutions that produce only 10 percent to 15 percent of the military's total active officer corps, but 30 percent to 50 percent of its generals and admirals. Reserve Officers Training Corps scholarships generate most of the commissioned officers in the armed forces. 'Leadership Laboratories'</p><p>"If we don't re-examine our purpose and look to see how our graduates are performing in the current world, we risk our very existence as an academy," said Brig. Gen. Ruben A. Cubero, the faculty dean at the Air Force Academy.</p><p>Since 1802, when West Point was founded, followed by the Naval Academy in 1845 and the Air Force Academy in 1954, the military has coveted its academies as "leadership laboratories," producing a long and distinguished line of military and naval leaders.</p><p>Today, Army and Air Force cadets and Navy midshipmen receive a four-year college education and a monthly salary of $543.90 in exchange for at least five years of active-duty service after graduation.</p><p>The academies accept about 10 percent of the 12,000 to 16,000 annual applicants, whose combined college board scores average about 1,200, on a par with such universities as Duke, Cornell and Notre Dame. Female Enrollment at 13%</p><p>Successful applicants must also be nominated to an academy by the President, the Vice President or a member of Congress. The academies first admitted women in 1976, and female students now make up about 13 percent of the enrollment at the academies.</p><p>Interviews with dozens of students at the academies show a wide array of reasons for selecting the service academies over civilian colleges, reasons that range from a desire for discipline and direction to the academies' reputations.</p><p>Marcy Dupre, a 24-year-old midshipman from Columbia, S.C., is following in the steps of five grandfathers, great-grandfathers and other relatives who attended the Naval Academy. "It's in my blood to go here," he said. At his graduation this spring he will receive his commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Eventually, he hopes to return to the Naval Academy as an instructor.</p><p>"President Bush talks a lot about budget cuts, so who really knows what will happen," Midshipman Dupre said. "At least I know for the next five or six years I'll have a paycheck coming in. A lot of people coming out of college now can't say that."  An Interservice University</p><p>Critics of the academies contend that the shrinking enrollments are driving up the price of an already expensive education, and call on Congress to study the feasibility of combining the three academies into one interservice defense university. The services strongly oppose such a plan.</p><p>The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, and the Congressional Budget Office reported last year that the Defense Department spends $155,000 to $230,000 to produce each academy graduate.</p><p>The agencies said the Pentagon spends only about one-third that amount to commission an officer through R.O.T.C. programs at civilian colleges. But Academy officials say those calculations fail to include other sources of Federal financing at those colleges that would increase the Government's actual cost for training officers through R.O.T.C.  Some Curriculum Changes</p><p>As in universities nationwide, the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has the service academies scrambling to rewrite parts of their curriculum, particularly in history and political science, where instructors are relying more on newspapers, magazines and television news.</p><p>"We just redid the syllabus over the summer," said Capt. Deborah Charron of the Air Force, a political science instructor. "But books aren't keeping up with what's going on in the world. To me that's not a problem, but a challenge."</p><p>Despite the long hours that Midshipman Flores and his classmates spent studying the characteristics of Soviet ships and submarines, most of the military instruction that cadets and midshipmen receive is very basic, and that is not likely to change substantially in the post-cold-war world.</p><p>The Air Force and Navy academies are heavily weighted toward academic majors in science and engineering, which are not affected by political upheaval. West Point is divided more equally between technical and humanities disciplines.</p><p>Academy officials insist their mission is not likely to change drastically, if at all, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. "We're not creating anti-communists here -- we're providing leaders for America," said Lieut. Gen. Howard D. Graves, the superintendent of West Point.</p><p>But decades of classroom and field training focused on Soviet-style doctrine, tactics and weaponry will make it difficult for the services to change their orientation overnight.</p><p>In the end, the question rests on future opportunities, and here students give differing views. The 'Top Gun' Fraternity</p><p>At "service selection" night recently at Annapolis, when graduating seniors pick their Navy speciality, an ornate room fills with the smell of new leather jackets, the emblem, along with aviator sunglasses, of Navy fighter pilots. The room oozes testosterone as Navy admirals welcome their youngest brethren to the "top gun" fraternity.</p><p>"The world is a very unstable place," said Midshipman Todd Finkler, 21, of Chester, Va., who was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but wanted to fly Navy FA-18's instead. "The threat will still be the Russians and instability in the Middle East."</p><p>In Capt. Howdy Belknap's American history class at West Point, plebes pause in a discussion of counterinsurgency tactics in the Spanish-American War to express their concerns.</p><p>"It's frightening to think you could put in four years of hard work here, and then get kicked out later," said Brian Perez, an 18-year-old plebe from Huntington, L.I. "It seems now you have to be perfect or the Army doesn't want you."</p><p>Photo: At the nation's military academies, cadets and midshipmen fear for future careers while remaining confident that the armed forces will always rely on a core of leaders from their ranks.
