But they do not always get in.   For the first time since the start of their explosive growth in the 1960's, community colleges -- which now enroll 36 percent of all students in higher education, and more than 50 percent of all freshmen -- are being forced to narrow their open-access policies and deal with fiscal constraints that will determine, to a large extent, whether they offer legitimate opportunity or just second-rate schooling. More Harm for Some    The colleges have been criticized for failing to keep their promise to America's most economically and academically disadvantaged students. Intellectual rigor can be flabby, classroom discipline loose, academic standards abstract. An associate's degree can be of little help in finding a good job.">

                    <p>In California, for example, the nation's largest community college system is turning away students because the state, for the first time, has refused to provide the financial support for everyone who wants to get in. Until now the state paid the 107 colleges, with an enrollment of over 1.5 million students, a set fee for each student no matter how many enrolled.</p><p>The California colleges also have raised their fees and for the first time are charging students who already have a degree $50 a credit more than other students, presumably to discourage them from taking up classroom space.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, officials have alerted community college presidents that the state will run short of money and not fully finance the colleges this year for all the students they admit. One of the largest community colleges in the nation, Miami-Dade Community College, capped enrollment earlier this year but was able to lift it two months ago only because voters in that hurricane-damaged region approved a special tax increase to support the school.</p><p>Officials of the American Association of Community Colleges say the picture is grim in most states and getting worse. Even where colleges have not limited enrollments they have been unable to schedule enough classes for new students, thus, in effect limiting their access to an education.</p><p>"This is a crucial period," said David R. Pierce, president of the association. He said financial imbalances have placed open access, the "centerpiece of our institutions, in very real jeopardy."</p><p>Although maligned as "high schools with ashtrays" or safe havens for students who cannot get into real colleges, the nation's 1,158 publicly financed community colleges, private junior colleges, and technical colleges have grown so much that they now enroll about 6.4 million students. For more than half of all entering freshman in higher education, going to college means going to the local community college.</p><p>Without community colleges, many of the 6.4 million would not go to college at all. But half of them are casual students who never earn more than 12 credits, and of the rest, only about a quarter go on to a senior college, down from more than 45 percent in the 1950's.  Still Providing Some Opportunity</p><p>The colleges are as unorthodox as their students, and administrators point out that, for many, the goal may not include a traditional academic course leading toward a degree. The students' average age is 29. Almost 65 percent attend part time, going to class at night or on the weekends. On average they take three years to get an associate's degree that used to take two years. Many, however, stretch the schooling to four or five years.</p><p>The degree itself is no lock on success. Someone holding an associate's degree can expect to make 29 percent more than a high school graduate, but far less money and social progress than someone with a bachelor's degree. Although occupational training programs can lead to attractive careers in computer science, many students end up in low-paying jobs in a field like cosmetology.</p><p>Nonetheless, community colleges in recent years have served as crucial portals for minority students, and the recent cutbacks threaten hard-won advances in that area. While community colleges enroll 37 percent of all white students in higher education, they enroll 38 percent of Asians, 42 percent of blacks and 54 percent of Hispanic students.</p><p>Community colleges have long been seen as salvage operations, giving the least advantaged students -- people like Nilda Ortiz of Homestead, Fla., -- a chance to grab the American Dream.</p><p>"Andrew didn't stop me and nothing is going to keep me away," said Ms. Ortiz. It was her first day of class at Miami-Dade Community College's battered Homestead campus, and though her home had been badly damaged by Hurricane Andrew, she was determined to begin her college career. "I've been waiting for this for a long, long time," she said.</p>                </div>
