                    <p>INTO THE WOODS</p><p>Orienteering is a noncompetitive sport in which individuals learn how to find their way through a wilderness by following a map and compass. A new orienteering program is available at the Trailside Nature Museum in Cross River every Wednesday through Sunday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Maps of 35 markers are available at the museum for $1.50 -- the only charge for participating -- and orienteers may come and go as they please, alone or in groups, during those hours.</p><p>Chris Cassone, director of the nonprofit Hudson Valley Orienteering Club, designed and installed the program. "Beginners should start out following markers on trails," he said. "More experienced people can go for the more difficult markers that are not on trails."</p><p>Ward Pound Ridge Reservation, on which Trailside is situated, has 4,700 acres of varied terrain that could be explored, but markers are limited to about a one-mile area, and the optimum time for completing a medium-to-difficult course is 40 to 60 minutes.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"Some people prefer to take their time," Mr. Cassone said. "Take the kids along and enjoy the outdoors." There are special sessions for toddlers, where they follow a ribbon on the ground. "By the time they are 8 or 10 and can read a map without difficulty, they can go out on their own,"Mr. Cassone said.</p><p>The program will run year round, with a New Year's morning event and a series of cross-country ski orienteerings. License plate numbers are recorded so that cars remaining in the parking lot too long will trigger a search for the owner.</p><p>The word orienteering was coined by Bjorn Kjellstrom of Sweden, who founded an organization called Science and Geography Through Orienteering with headquarters in Colorado Springs and Pound Ridge. It is the parent of Mr. Cassone's Hudson Valley Club, which has no initiation fee or dues. "We go to a different park in the tristate area each week," he said. Participants pay $3 or $5 for the map, depending on their age and the difficulty of the course.</p><p>The numbers to call for more information are 763-3993 and 225-1733. BOOK CENSORSHIP</p><p>Eighteen panels of photographs, texts and illustrations on censorship of literature, history, philosophy and religious studies down through the ages will be on display at the Chappaqua Library through Nov. 16.</p><p>The exhibition, organized by the Texas Humanities Resource Center of Austin, is called "The Bonfire of Liberties." It illustrates the variety of techniques employed to stamp out individual thinking by controlling the written word.</p><p>In some editions Shakespeare has been altered to make it suitable for family reading; "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" has been banned several times since publication; books have been burned, as have people, and printed matter has been impounded or restricted by religious sects, politically inspired groups, customs officials, postal services, governments and school boards. At one time or another, almost every nation has participated in some form of censorship of published works.</p><p>The library, at 195 South Greeley Avenue, is open Mondays through Thursdays from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., Fridays from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M., Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays from 1 to 4 P.M. Further information can be obtained by calling 238-4779. CZECH PHOTOGRAPHER</p><p>Vaclav Havel and the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia were recorded by a Czech photographer named Tibor Huszar, who will have a showing of about 40 of the pictures on Tuesday through Thursday at the Pelham Art Center. Mr. Huszar documented Mr. Havel's travels around Czechoslovakia along with shots of political prisoners being released, and scenes of Gypsy life in rural villages.</p><p>The exhibition came about through mutual friends of the photographer and Alexander Rutsch, a Westchester sculptor whose bronzes will be on view at the same time.</p><p>Mr. Huszar now lives in Manhattan, photographing New York City with the theme of "Tolerance." He hopes to exhibit the collection in Eastern Europe as an inspiration for better understanding among ethnic factions.</p><p>He studied film and photography at Charles University in Prague and graduated with the film maker Milos Forman, who is expected to attend the opening reception on Tuesday from 7 to 9 P.M. Hours on Wednesday and Thursday are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p><p>The center is at 155 Fifth Avenue in Pelham. For more information, call 738-2525. NEW ARTS CENTER</p><p>The opening of One Station Plaza early last month has given Ossining a new center for performing and visual arts. So far the agenda has included gospel music, poetry readings, storytelling, a recital on the Japanese flute, a photography show and an evening of country-folk music.</p><p>Next Saturday's program features Carolina Slim, the blues singer-guitarist whose style is reminiscent of Muddy Waters and B. B. King. Doors open at 7:30 P.M., and visitors may take time to view an exhibition of watercolors by Therese Moore.</p><p>The music of John Coltrane will be on the bill on Nov. 14, performed by Sonny Sharrock's Jazz Masters Repertory Band in two sessions, at 8 and 9:30 P.M. A poetry reading by Marylou DiPietro is included, and the art exhibition, running on Nov. 7 and 14, will be by Ilse Schreiber, a woodcutter who studied with Antonio Frasconi.</p><p>The name of the center is also its address, three flights up at the corner of Water and Lower Main Streets across from the parking lot of the Ossining train station. Admission is $7, and more information can obtained by calling 762-9847. THE GUITARIST JIM HALL</p><p>Jim Hall, the guitarist whose musical idols are Art Tatum and Bela Bartok, will be the artist in the Guitar Greats series on Friday at 8 P.M. in the Student Lounge at Westchester Community College.</p><p>Mr. Hall, who sprang from a musical family, had his life's course set at 10 when his mother gave him a guitar for Christmas. Eventually, he studied at the Cleveland Institute of Music, and his classical background continues to provide breadth and depth for his performances.</p><p>Over the years he has played and recorded with a diverse group of musicians including Sonny Rollins, George Shearing, Andre Previn and Itzhak Perlman. But it is in solo recitals like the one scheduled on Friday that his ease with both traditional and jazz repertories and his resourcefulness in experimentation are most evident.</p><p>Among the guitarists who will appear in future programs of the series are David Tanenbaum on Jan. 29, Steve Morse on March 5 and the English guitarist Julian Bream on April 30. Tickets are $12, or $5 for students. Call 285-6567 for reservations or more information. The college is at 75 Grasslands Road in Valhalla.  SONGS OF SILVER SCREEN</p><p>"That Old Black Magic," "Stormy Weather," "Singin' in the Rain," "We're in the Money," "42d Street," "Blue Skies," "Louise" and "Mimi" are just a few of the songs from the great movie musicals that will be revisited in "A Salute to the Musicals of the Silver Screen" for the next two weekends.</p><p>The production, by the Yorktown Regional Theater Company, opens Saturday at the Yorktown Performing Arts Theater on Veterans Road in Yorktown Heights. Four performances, with full orchestra, chorus and dancers, are scheduled at 8 P.M. Saturday and 3 P.M. Sunday through Nov. 15. Tickets at $13 to $18 may be reserved by calling 962-6665.</p>                </div>
