Now, like medicine, religion and other important and once revered fields, higher education is discovering how difficult, and how costly, it can be to be scorned. Louis Harris, the public opinion pollster who has been tracking confidence in public institutions since 1966, says that trust in universities has been ebbing over the last five years. Now, only 25 percent of those polled say they have a great deal of confidence in the people running higher education, as against a high point of 56 percent in 1966.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"Universities did better than other institutions for a while," Mr. Harris said in an interview, "but now they're coming back to the pack."</p><p>The loss of public trust has been most dramatic in public higher education. Until the end of the 1980's, the state university systems had enjoyed more than 30 years of steady financial support.</p><p>The economic recession of the last few years would have forced the states to moderate spending anyway, but as universities' image grew darker it became easier for legislators to target professors who seemed underworked and administrative staffs that appeared to be bloated. In almost every state, the universities are getting a shrinking percentage of the state's overall spending, an indication, many say, of a public perception that higher education has grown fat.</p><p>Part of the reason for universities' unpopularity is a string of unsavory episodes. These include college athletics scandals over point-shaving and improper recruiting; the controversy over the inclusion of non-Western authors in humanities curriculums at the expense of traditional Western figures; a United States Justice Department antitrust suit against Ivy League colleges, which were accused of colluding on financial aid grants; and the disclosure -- for many, the last straw -- that Stanford and other universities had improperly charged the Federal Government for indirect research expenditures that included the upkeep of a yacht and the purchases of personal furniture and flowers. University-Bashing</p><p>Tainted by such allegations and by lingering suspicions among parents and legislators that tuition hikes are not justified, most colleges and universities have indeed come under siege. University-bashing has become so popular that the American Association for Higher Education, an organization of 8,000 administrators, professors and staff members, has chosen as the main topic for its annual conference "Reclaiming the Public Trust." The conference begins today in Chicago.</p><p>"It just seemed more and more that higher education was falling out of favor," said Louis S. Albert, a vice president of the association. "Our conclusion was that there has been a real decline in public trust and we need to take steps to reclaim it."</p><p>It is not only here that universities are under attack. In England, the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher severely reduced higher education appropriations in 1981. Mrs. Thatcher had determined that while population changes meant fewer college-age students, many voters had grown increasingly convinced that universities were pampered.</p><p>"Universities were deeply shocked to have been cut in this way," said Auriol Stevens, director of the universities information unit of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom. "And they were even more deeply shocked that no one seemed to mind."</p><p>To regain their high ground, the universities became more responsive to the needs of British industry, creating private research partnerships and changing curriculums to better prepare students for work. They also established Ms. Stevens' office in London, their first public relations effort to control the debate.</p><p>Higher education in the United States may lag a few years behind the United Kingdom in that respect, but it seems to be following a similar path. Catherine T. Stimpson, dean of the graduate school at Rutgers University and a scheduled panelist at the American Association for Higher Education conference, said universities are only partly to blame for the shift in public attitudes.</p><p>"If there has been a loss in public trust it has come from two sources: what we've done to ourselves and what has been done to us," Dean Stimpson said. In the first category she includes the athletic scandals, high minority dropout rates and confusion over curriculum. She is more bitter about the second category, which she describes as "a decade of half-truth and distortions about the reality of higher education, all of which culminated in the P.C. debate."  A Catch-All Putdown</p><p>P.C., or political correctness, has evolved into a catch-all campus putdown. It is used to accuse universities of pandering to members of minority groups and others who might be considered "victims" by adopting requirements such as multicultural curriculums and codes to ban offensive speech.</p><p>Academic traditionalists such as those in the National Association of Scholars have portrayed these trends as an orthodoxy of liberal ideas. And they say the universities' loss of face is deserved. Dinesh D'Souza, the traditionalist author of "Illiberal Education," an indictment of higher education, has said that universities have lost the public's confidence because they "have not given an ample accounting of themselves."</p><p>Once the universities' image was tarnished, it didn't take long for the public to turn away. No one knows how long it will take to reclaim this lost trust, but there are signs, such as Stanford's rigorous new accounting system and Harvard's new emphasis on teaching, that universities have gotten the message.</p><p>"If those good things start to spread," said former Governor Kean, "then the period for reclaiming trust could be relatively short." On the other hand, he argued, "if we stonewall, if we think we're better than everyone else, if we think we know better, then it will take far longer."</p><p>Drawing</p>                </div>
