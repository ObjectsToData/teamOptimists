Why is it that human beings want to know more, even more than they can know, about themselves and the world? Why must they try to experience everything they can imagine, even virtual death, in order to discover what is ultimately in store for them? And to what extent is the pursuit of such knowledge helpful or harmful, right or wrong? Flirtation with knowledge beyond our grasp is the theme of an illuminating and disturbing book, Roger Shattuck's ''Forbidden Knowledge.'' The ancient question of what to do with what we do (or do not) know remains the central moral issue of our time.  ">

                    <p>St. Martin's Press. $26.95.</p><p>Why is it that human beings want to know more, even more than they can know, about themselves and the world? Why must they try to experience everything they can imagine, even virtual death, in order to discover what is ultimately in store for them? And to what extent is the pursuit of such knowledge helpful or harmful, right or wrong? Flirtation with knowledge beyond our grasp is the theme of an illuminating and disturbing book, Roger Shattuck's ''Forbidden Knowledge.'' The ancient question of what to do with what we do (or do not) know remains the central moral issue of our time.</p><p>The desire for forbidden knowledge was first explored in myth: the story of Adam and Eve and the loss of Paradise; the tale of Prometheus, who gave men the skills Zeus sought to deny them; and, most emblematic of all, Homer's tale of Odysseus and the song of the Sirens. Odysseus is told by the goddess Circe how to approach the Sirens' island and still survive -- by having himself lashed to the mast of his ship and the ears of all his sailors plugged with wax, so they will not be lured by the Sirens and he alone will hear their song. The Sirens try to lure Odysseus by a promise of knowledge: the history of the Trojan War, and ''everything that happens on the fruitful earth.'' He tries to get the crew to untie him, but they cannot hear him and sail on. So Odysseus never hears what the Sirens had to tell him; the gods keep complete knowledge hidden from mortals until the moment of their death. In a way, everyone who wants to learn more about the world must confront the Sirens: should we stay to learn more, risking death and destruction, or continue to live on in our partial ignorance?</p><p>Mr. Shattuck, a professor of modern foreign languages and literature at Boston University, confronts the problem of forbidden knowledge by taking his readers on a journey. But we not only travel; like Odysseus, we are forced to think. The itinerary takes us around, past and directly into key works of Western literature. Mr. Shattuck first describes how writers throughout history have framed the issue. The biblical story of Adam and Eve is, of course, a fundamental text; but Mr. Shattuck gives an interesting account of how Milton in ''Paradise Lost'' expands and develops the Hebrew narrative: he allows Adam and Eve not merely to see what they have done but to contemplate the possibility of mankind's eventual redemption. Goethe's Faust also confronts (and evades) the moral problem faced by anyone who seeks to have more than ordinary knowledge or power. Don Quixote is (to use Harold Bloom's formulation) a failed precursor of Faust, and Don Juan is a Faust without a university degree.</p><p>Mr. Shattuck endows Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' with new meaning by treating it as a commentary on Goethe's poem, and shows how the basic tale of the master and his horrible, morally deficient creation gave rise to tales of doppelgangers, like Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'' Complementing these stories of excessive ambition are narratives of abstinence. Here (as Mr. Shattuck acutely observes) the protagonists are mainly female: Syrinx in the Greek myth, who flees from Pan; the reluctantly virtuous heroine of Mme. de La Fayette's ''Princesse de Cleves,'' who refuses to take a lover both before and after her husband dies; the strange, elusive persona created by Emily Dickinson, in her poems and in her letters. Dickinson's persona, unlike her male counterparts in earlier fiction, appears to be content simply to contemplate the unattainable: ''Heaven -- is what I cannot reach -- / The apple on the tree / Provided it do hopeless hang / -- That -- Heaven is to me --.''</p><p>Next Mr. Shattuck considers the question of responsibility: when (if ever) can homicide be justified? Why do we sympathize with the ingenuous and appealing Billy Budd in Herman Melville's novel and also with the morally inert murderer-hero of ''The Stranger,'' by Albert Camus? Mr. Shattuck explains why the proverb ''To understand is to forgive'' is morally insufficient, and why there can be (however attractive the formula may seem) no greatness in evil.</p><p>Here the literary tour ends, and we begin to discover why we were asked to go on the journey. For Mr. Shattuck, as for people in virtually all past generations and societies, literature is not simply a means of entertainment or employment. It is a method of instruction. Like philosophy, it raises deep moral issues. After we have considered narratives of forbidden knowledge, we are better able to understand the moral questions posed by events in our own time. As in his discussion of literature, Mr. Shattuck does not speculate about what his authors may have meant, or try to discover support for his own views in their work. Rather, he draws on the authors' own biographies and writings to discuss authorial intentions and evasions. J. Robert Oppenheimer knew that the deaths caused by the atomic bomb he had helped to create were his burden: ''The physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.'' Edward Teller had no such qualms: ''There is no case where ignorance should be preferred to knowledge -- especially if the knowledge is terrible.'' A series of case studies, including the moral issues raised by the development of genetic engineering, reveals how it has become virtually impossible to draw a line between pure and applied science. Scientists, Mr. Shattuck suggests, like doctors, need to take a Hippocratic oath that will help make them better aware of their responsibilities; he cites the version suggested by the geneticist James Neel: ''Above all, do no harm.''</p><p>Literary scholars have a similar obligation, even though their craft, at least as practiced in universities today, seems far removed from any practical reality. Mr. Shattuck points out that amoral and immoral works of literature can and do corrupt -- not all readers, but some -- and he insists that scholars must say why they are wrongheaded and even harmful. To prove his point, he quotes some horrific passages from the writings of the Marquis de Sade, and shows how literary critics have treated these perverted writings with the same detachment Mr. Teller applied to the question of the atomic bomb, as if they supposed that such imaginings could have no effect on human action and existed as ''pure science.'' Not that Mr. Shattuck suggests that the works of Sade or of other pornographers should be banned or in any way suppressed. But he believes that critics have an obligation not simply to speak about the power of Sade's ideas and the wide influence of his writing. They must also give full emphasis to the moral depravity of Sade's attempt to imagine the extremes of human depravity. It is no coincidence that these same issues are taken up in A. S. Byatt's latest novel, ''Babel Tower,'' which explores the negative consequences of the licentiousness of the 1960's.</p><p>MR. SHATTUCK, in spite of, or perhaps because of, the wide range of his learning, writes engagingly and clearly about both literature and science. His book also serves as a welcome reminder that some highly influential European literature has a significant moral component, and is not concerned primarily (or even secondarily) with agendas of sexism, racism or colonialism. Significantly, the concern with the moral consequences of human action was not much affected by the discoveries of Darwin. The debate about the ethical consequences of scientific knowledge has, if anything, intensified. Mr. Shattuck shows how the same issues apply equally well to the imaginative experiments pursued in the study of the arts. As ''Forbidden Knowledge'' itself splendidly illustrates, the most informative use of literary criticism is to explore the moral issues of lasting concern defined in works of literature.</p>                </div>
