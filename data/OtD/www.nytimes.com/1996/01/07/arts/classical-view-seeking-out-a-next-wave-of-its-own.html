The village once got along quite nicely in relative isolation. It used its own industry and dealt with its own people, then it fell  into decline. New ideas invigorate its changed circumstances, but now there are  competitors nearby: large, fierce and distinctly urban ones, all competing for the same shrinking resources.         The Brooklyn Philharmonic sits where it always has, but it might as well have been picked up and moved. I remember, as a reviewer in the 1980's, crossing under the East River and into a different, now vanished world. Here were rows of families dressed in their best; interspersed were the college professors and graduate students who stiffen the spine of small-city cultural life. It might have been Wheeling, W. Va., or Greensburg, Pa., on a Sunday afternoon.   ">

New ideas invigorate its changed circumstances, but now there are  competitors nearby: large, fierce and distinctly urban ones, all competing for the same shrinking resources.</p><p>The Brooklyn Philharmonic sits where it always has, but it might as well have been picked up and moved. I remember, as a reviewer in the 1980's, crossing under the East River and into a different, now vanished world. Here were rows of families dressed in their best; interspersed were the college professors and graduate students who stiffen the spine of small-city cultural life. It might have been Wheeling, W. Va., or Greensburg, Pa., on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Performances were perfunctory; repertory was predictable, but the Brooklyn Philharmonic performed the basic musical service necessary to its habitat. Players were, as they are now, part-time, but concert-givers elsewhere, along with the makers of television and radio commercials, gave them plenty of work. Brooklyn was one more stop on the musician's subway itinerary.</p><p>In 1996, the Brooklyn Philharmonic and its new music director, Robert Spano,  are confronting a music world that is leaner, meaner and altogether less charitable. Competition for shrinking audiences has made New York's free-floating orchestras better. The synthesizer's ascendance in the advertising world has made their musicians hungrier. Mr. Spano, 34 years old and already a thriving guest conductor, gets his first taste of this world next month, when he conducts a weekend of Brooklyn Philharmonic concerts called "Orientalism." It will be his New York debut.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Spano's predecessor, Dennis Russell Davies, came and went scarcely before we knew it. Mr. Spano admits that he won't be here forever either, but he seems  serious about his first rooted job and is apartment-hunting in Brooklyn Heights. He brings no new broom but signs on to a program already in motion. Interestingly and with mixed success, his orchestra-to-be has lived by its wits  the last few seasons, and done it through theme-dominated weekends teased into existence by the orchestra's executive director, Joseph Horowitz.</p><p>Mr. Horowitz has gotten mouthwatering glimpses of what his new and sustaining audience might turn out to be, namely the young, hip, engaged listenership being drawn by the Next Wave Festival, the orchestra's co-worker and cohabitant at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Next Wave mixes music and theater, blurs the line between popular and classical, and has fascinated a whole new set of listeners.  But how do you bring people not raised to symphonic music into a propless, untheatrical concert-hall habitat, where the eye is checked at the door and the  ear must function on its own?</p><p>Connections, says Mr. Horowitz: music of Ives next to readings of Thoreau, Duke Ellington with a William Grant Still symphony, Stravinsky and the Russian folk roots he slyly drew from. "We have been thinking about 'Don Quixote' as treated by Roberto Gerhard and by Strauss," he adds. "The Gerhard may not appeal to conservative audiences; the Strauss may not appeal to more adventurous ones. The two pieces side by side bring both sets of listeners together."</p><p>Anathema to Mr. Horowitz is the mixed program (Mozart to wake listeners up, a modern piece to trap them in their seats until intermission, some Brahms to lure them back for the second half). Anathema as well is the term "classical music."  "We never use it," he says.</p><p>Theme series, featuring music, talk and exhibits, took off in the late 80's and early 90's, when Roger Norrington took his Experience weekends from Britain  to the Pepsico Summerfare in Purchase, N.Y., and to Lincoln Center. Other presenters are now in hot pursuit, especially Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra, whose Bartok weekend at Alice Tully Hall in November came just before the Brooklyn's own Bartok weekend and did damage to its attendance.</p><p>THROUGH DRACONIAN PERSONNEL CHANGES, Mr. Botstein has brought his orchestra from a shambling state to acceptability, which is pretty much the condition of the Brooklyn organization now. Neither group comes near the elegance and adaptability of the Orchestra of St. Luke's and Orpheus, or the tight efficiency of Gerard Schwarz's New York Chamber Symphony. Can the strength of ideas overcome basic frailties of execution? At the moment, both the American Symphony and the Brooklyn Philharmonic are depending on it.</p><p>This is where Mr. Spano comes in. Fiercely musical, well organized and possessed of an energy bordering on the feral, he has the intriguing assignment  of making a compelling ensemble out of players he will face in three subscription weeks a year plus an event or two more. An orchestra and a conductor retain memories of each other, he says, but one wonders.</p><p>The Brooklyn's audiences have been respectable, but box office accounts for about 36 percent of a $2.2 million budget, not a good average in a capitalistic  country. A helpful grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities came and went, but the Knight Foundation has given money.</p><p>The revived Brooklyn Philharmonic is a noble experiment that goes beyond Brooklyn or any other New York borough. It will be interesting to see if its test tubes hold answers. Can the brightest listeners of a new generation be drawn to symphonic concerts? Can small orchestras in big surroundings endure an  increasingly anxious and cutthroat environment? The fittest will survive, but the word "fit" has yet to be satisfactorily defined.</p><p>Photo: The Brooklyn Philharmonic -- Changed surroundings.
