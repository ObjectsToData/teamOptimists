                    <p>Stetson Hall was once the library of Williams College, and Prof. Mark Taylor's office feels like what it used to be: the stacks. Bookshelves crowd the narrow room. The low ceiling serves double duty as bulletin board, dotted with postcards from students. About all that stands out in the closeness is the big screen of a Macintosh.</p><p>Mr. Taylor, professor of religion, student of Hegel and Kierkegaard, remembers complaining, as research assistants set up the computer, that he now had less space than ever. "Mark, this is your office," one of them reassured him, tapping the computer. "You have more space in here than you'll ever need."</p><p>Mr. Taylor, telling the story, had just come from "Cyberscapes," his course  exploring the philosophical and cultural implications of the information revolution, from Kant to Warhol to the Internet. A student's final project was on his screen: not a paper, but hypertext, a digital collage of writing, pictures, video and sound.</p><p>As a philosopher and teacher, Mark Taylor stands between the virtual reality  gathering around his students and the ultimate reality pursued by the giants of  19th-century European philosophy. For his efforts to unite the two, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching named him its undergraduate professor of the year for 1995.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Convinced that there are new logics in a world wired for instant communication, that reading and writing are different on line, and that the next generation needs a new kind of literacy, he creates courses that confront students with technological innovation.</p><p>Mr. Taylor, the college's Preston S. Parish Third Century Professor of Humanities, and his students are clearly traveling uncharted territory. Students in "Cyberscapes" learn to compose hypertext in computer labs. There is no set form, no style rules for hypertext.</p><p>There are other differences: in another of his courses, "Psychology of Religion," whose students have to write a paper, "They all want to come in and tell me what they plan to do to see if it's O.K.," he said. But in "Cyberscapes," students tend to keep their work to themselves until delivering it to Mr. Taylor by pushing a button. "They don't want to tell you what they're  doing," Mr. Taylor said. "They want to surprise you."</p><p>Mr. Taylor says that the book-bound academy has no choice: it must log on or  become irrelevant.</p><p>"It's hard to see what's taking place because of all the hype," Mr. Taylor said. "Part of what has to be done is to situate what's taking place historically and to analyze it. It's not all panacea. But these changes are coming, whether we like it or not, so we better figure out ways to deal with them before someone else does for us."</p><p>A "global seminar" in 1992 linked Mr. Taylor and his students at Williams with the University of Helsinki through teleconferences and E-mail. Student assistants created a "cybercollege," an Internet forum for his classes. This month he takes a class to Las Vegas, Nev., part of a monthlong mini-course between semesters to make a "homebrew CD-ROM" about the desert city, "where the  virtual becomes real and the real becomes virtual."</p><p>But Mr. Taylor, 50, who has been at the university since 1973, is also an old-fashioned taskmaster. To succeed in "Cyberscapes" or "Introduction to Religion," you will participate in class; whether on paper or by E-mail, you will write clearly and powerfully. And the subject will be difficult, for in all of the many directions he turns, the starting point is Western traditions of religion, philosophy and art, an intellectual immunization against the disorder  of the future.</p><p>"There are thinkers who are important to think about, and there are thinkers who are important to think with," Mr. Taylor said. "You apprentice yourself to them. The dues are high. But this is how you learn to think.</p><p>"It has never occurred to me not to teach a text because it was too hard," he said. "Why should I teach William James when you can read and understand it yourself? But if you read Hegel, you're not going to understand it. That's something I can teach."</p><p>In return, Williams students enter a collaboration with him. A compulsive writer not only on religion and philosophy but also on art, architecture and media, he uses his courses to explore what he is thinking about in his own intellectual life.</p><p>"When I conceive a course, I don't think of it as a survey of certain philosophers, but as a series of problems I'm thinking about that I can use as a framework," he said. "Writing is where I stay alive in certain ways, and teaching to me is an ongoing conversation."</p><p>He is also aware that students who know more about computers than he does are teaching him. (He also relies on his wife, Dinny, who helped him through high school physics in their hometown of Westfield, N.J., and now is Williams's  director of administrative computing.) The cybercollege, for example, was created by students in his global seminar as a way to continue its discussions;  he now regularly uses it in other courses.</p>                </div>
