                    <p>The restructuring of the American work force has come to campus, and at Yale  University it is fueling a bitter labor dispute over the making of one of the nation's most arcane products: Ph.D.'s.</p><p>Facing bleak job prospects when they complete their doctoral study, some Yale graduate students are trying to form a union to improve their lot during their six or more years of research and apprentice teaching here.</p><p>Threatened by Yale with losing their teaching jobs, the students decided on  Sunday to end a strike in which they had withheld grades from courses they had taught last semester. But the battle is focusing new attention on why universities are producing so many Ph.D.'s when financial pressures are prompting them to hire fewer for permanent tenured positions.</p><p>Supporters of the Yale students say the answer is obvious: graduate teaching  assistants are cheap labor for universities, especially public ones, which rely  on them much more than Ivy League institutions like Yale do. An average teaching assistant at Yale is paid $4,970 a semester; a full professor, $90,000 a year.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The idea that the students are serving apprenticeships is delusory, these critics say, because jobs are not waiting for them at the end; increasingly, new Ph.D.'s, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, join a permanent pool of cheap labor that universities hire as part-time adjuncts in place of full-time professors. And since the job market turned down with the recession in 1989, the number of humanities doctorates awarded annually has increased 20.7 percent, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.</p><p>"The changes in the job market are changing apprenticeship into exploitation," said Prof. Cary Nelson of the University of Illinois at Urbana. Professor Nelson, who teaches liberal arts and writes often about the economic quandary of graduate students, said that as long as universities can not do without graduate teaching assistants, they should at least pay them a living wage.</p><p>Yale counters that it cares about both the prospects of its students and their well-being during their years in New Haven. But graduate students are just that, not employees, Yale insists, and the university will never recognize a union for them.</p><p>"It's not that there's no problem here with graduate education," Richard C. Levin, president of Yale, said. "Graduate students have some legitimate concerns, and we're prepared to address them through reasoned conversation -- which is different from their idea of negotiation for a written, binding agreement.</p><p>In many ways, Yale might seem an unlikely campus for a union struggle by graduate students. Nearly all of them study tuition-free within some of the nation's most prestigious academic departments. Stipends cover most of their living expenses. Teaching loads are relatively light. Of the 11 graduate-student unions that have been recognized, all are at public universities, including Rutgers, the University of Wisconsin and several campuses of the University of California.</p><p>"They really are among the blessed of the earth," Prof. Peter Brooks, chairman of the department of comparative literature, said. "So I sometimes feel annoyed at them seeing themselves as exploited." Nevertheless, he said, his students' concerns over employment and financial aid were just.</p><p>It is unclear how many of the 1,200 graduate students in the humanities and social-science divisions support the union. In an unofficial vote, 600 of 766 students polled said they wanted it to represent them.</p><p>But the sense of graduate students as exploited, with little hope of a tenured reward later, has met with more than sympathy from a union already on campus, the Federation of University Employees, an affiliate of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union. Increasingly, blue-collar unions in search of white-collar workers to organize are financing campaigns for graduate-student unions; in California, for example, the unions are supported by the United Auto Workers.</p><p>And as universities trim departments and substitute cheaper part-time labor for full professors, the industrial union model is finding an audience among students who see ivory towers acting more like corporate headquarters.</p><p>"I was shocked to find all kinds of people who got Ph.D.'s from Yale taking adjunct positions while they look for a tenure-track job," said Gordon Lafer, who turned down a tenure-track job after taking his Ph.D. in political science from Yale last spring. Instead, he became research director for the Federation of University Employees, which represents 3,800 blue-collar and clerical workers at Yale and supports the graduate-student group.</p><p>"The universities are at a critical point," he said. "Either everyone is going to continue to be driven down to the lowest common denominator -- and right now everyone is so desperate they are willing to underbid each other -- or we're going to find a way to pull up the bottom of the market by organizing teaching assistants or organizing adjuncts."</p><p>The nightmare of graduate students is to become academic nomads, commuting among campuses, paid by the course.</p><p>As that group grows, its members will be trapped in their lower status, while the nature of university teaching itself changes, said Robin Brown, a fifth-year graduate student in comparative literature who is president of the Yale group, the Graduate Employees and Students Organization.</p><p>"It's very hard for me to conceive of being an adjunct for the next 40 years," she said.</p><p>Statistics on part-time faculty are sketchy, though some estimates put the proportion at 40 percent of all people teaching college courses. What is clear is that the collapse of the job market and the end of mandatory retirement at age 70 delayed thousands of expected openings, and the number of new Ph.D.'s grew.</p><p>In 1993, for example, 4,481 Ph.D.'s were awarded in the humanities, compared  with 3,500 in 1987, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.</p><p>Since 1992 Yale has reduced its graduate admissions in humanities and social-science departments by as much as a third. (Its science departments, by contrast, are growing, and graduate students there, with more generous stipends  provided by research grants, have shown no interest in a union.)</p><p>The reduction in admissions has allowed Yale to spread $55.5 million in financial aid among fewer students, said Thomas Appelquist, the graduate dean. And only $5.5 million of that, he said, is paid to students for teaching. Through their first five years, they are expected to teach in only the third and fourth years.</p><p>While students want stipends raised to cover full living expenses, so they can devote summers to research instead of working, Mr. Appelquist said Yale's aid was competitive with other leading research universities.</p><p>"We provide enormous amounts of financial aid, but it should not be expected, and it was never promised, that we will cover all costs," he said. Of $30,000 a  year in tuition and expenses, he said, Yale gives the typical student $26,000 to $27,000.</p><p>Yale has hired nontenured lecturers and adjuncts mainly to teach basic foreign-language courses, he said. Students, he said, are the primary instructors for about 9 percent of the enrollment in Yale College, little changed over the last decade.</p><p>Supporters of the graduate students acknowledge that many of their complaints will strike the public as whining unless the institution's quality declines by use of the students in place of professors.</p><p>Graph: "A Tough Job Market for an English Ph.D." shows employmentstatus of people receiving English Ph.D.'s in a give year as a percentage of all English Ph.D.'s given.
