A familiar autumnal image of a Connecticut campus, perhaps, yet one that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago.    In the 1980's, St. Basil College in Stamford had the smallest student body of any college in the state. Enrollments consisted at times of only a half-dozen students; there was even a year when the entire graduating class could be counted on one finger. Back then, the threat of losing state accreditation seemed very real. Forget soccer. This college's students would have had a hard time getting up a doubles match. Yet St. Basil kept operating, because it had to: It was the only seminary for Ukrainian Catholic priests in the United States.   ">

A familiar autumnal image of a Connecticut campus, perhaps, yet one that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago.</p><p>In the 1980's, St. Basil College in Stamford had the smallest student body of any college in the state. Enrollments consisted at times of only a half-dozen students; there was even a year when the entire graduating class could be counted on one finger. Back then, the threat of losing state accreditation seemed very real. Forget soccer. This college's students would have had a hard time getting up a doubles match. Yet St. Basil kept operating, because it had to: It was the only seminary for Ukrainian Catholic priests in the United States.</p><p>The fact that their branch of Catholicism, with Byzantine rather than Roman roots, was being suppressed in its homeland by a Communist government gave the college something to live for. Nevertheless, it appeared St. Basil might soon close, as had many other Catholic seminaries in recent years.</p><p>Today St. Basil College has more students than it has seen in years: 51, and expected to rise steadily in the years to come. By 1999, if all goes according to plan, the college will have a hundred students for the first time ever. The reason is one of the most ambitious foreign study programs at an American college. Nearly all of St. Basil's student population is from Ukraine. They are united by what they call a common goal: To become priests back home in a land where such a calling was banned by law only a few years ago.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The program is described by its administrators as a classic case of Christian reciprocity: A native church that sent priests to America in the late 1800's to minister to Ukrainian immigrants is now receiving help from the descendants of those it once looked after.</p><p>''It was time to give a gift back, a hundred years later,'' said Msgr. John Terlecky, vice chairman of the school's board of trustees.</p><p>The program began in the fall of 1994. St. Basil's rector, the Rev. Edward P. Young said there is a severe need for seminaries to educate the crop of would-be-priests in Ukraine that emerged with the collapse of the Soviet Union. ''Enrollment is overflowing,'' he said of the situation there. ''Seminaries are stuffed to the gills. There is no room.''</p><p>Monsignor Terlecky, who journeyed to Ukraine immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union, recalled newly created seminaries there with more than 300 beginning students and no program to speak of. ''Here we were, who had prayed for years for the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest,'' he said. ''Now they were showing up, and we had no place to put them.''</p><p>In contrast, St. Basil College was a seminary with a program but no students. Established in 1939 when growing turmoil in Ukraine made the education of American priests there less feasible, St. Basil is on the former campus of a girls' boarding school, Glen Eden Academy, which had closed during the Depression. Enrollment had begun to decline in the late 1960's, and by the 1980's was down to a trickle.</p><p>As the Soviet Union faltered, Bishop Basil H. Losten had kept the seminary's state certification active during a three-year period when it no longer offered a full college program, only housing and some specialized courses in Ukrainian Catholicism. Bishop Losten -- one of four Ukrainian Catholic diocesan bishops in the United States whose parish of New England and New York State includes St. Basil -- said he did this with an eye toward the changes in the East. ''When Communism fell, those kids in the Ukraine were going to need a place to study,'' he said. ''Since the Motherland had helped us in times of immigration, I thought we could reciprocate in some way.''</p><p>While the students will have to return to Ukraine for four more years of studies before completing their training, Bishop Losten said at St. Basil they get a core understanding of humanities and philosophy unavailable in their homeland, as well as a first-hand view of the West.</p><p>''Over there, you learn what they tell you to learn,'' Bishop Losten said. ''You're not expected to learn for yourself. It's still a communistic system. Here, they learn to think and make decisions.''</p><p>It is a stark contrast from the life they knew only a short time before. Sister Sheila Campbell, a Roman Catholic nun who teaches English to first-year arrivals, recalled meeting her first Ukrainian class in 1994. ''When I walked in the door, they jumped up and stood at their desks,'' she said. ''I nearly died.''</p><p>The students, most of them still in their late teens, spend their first year completely immersed in learning English before beginning a four-year liberal arts college program. Courses include biology and psychology as well as Greek and Latin. English, not Ukrainian, is the main language spoken. There is even a new computer center on campus.</p>                </div>
