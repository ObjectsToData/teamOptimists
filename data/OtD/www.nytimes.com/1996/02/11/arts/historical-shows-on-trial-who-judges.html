After all, he realized, the researcher's work could be perfect fodder for &quot;ill-wishers&quot; who would seize upon it as proof that the Smithsonian was cut off  from the mainstream of American thinking, and a skeptical and peevish Congress would have an open invitation to squeeze the institution's budget yet again.

                    <p>By some measures, things have lately grown worse.</p><p>A spate of cancellations and quickly retailored exhibitions -- on subjects as diverse as slave life on Southern plantations, the history of lynching, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and the theories of Freud -- has raised tough questions about how the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress, and by implication other cultural institutions, now go about their business.</p><p>Exhibitions are being reformulated or repackaged or simply dropped in response to complaints from just about anyone -- from staff members of the presenting institutions to members of the general public who claim some interest in the subject.</p><p>What is going on in Washington? Does every exhibition have to pass a test, guaranteeing that it will not bother anyone, before anyone is allowed to see it? Looking at the crowds snaking around the National Gallery of Art waiting to see  Vermeer last month, it has begun to seem as if the only thing that can go on display without incident in the shadow of the Capitol these days is a 17th-century Dutch painter. Get any closer to the present, or to America, and you're certain to offend someone. And fear of offending someone -- anyone -- now seems to govern the cultural climate of Washington far more than the presentation of ideas.</p><p>Indeed, there is little or no debate on just how the nation's history should  be presented to the public. How balanced a view of history should publicly supported institutions have? Whose version of history should prevail when views differ? And just what is the point of historical exhibitions today, in a media-saturated age in which simply presenting a revered object is rarely thought to be enough? Can an airplane, a manuscript, or a 60-year old cartoon tell a story all by itself?</p><p>There is always an explanation by the authorities to justify each change or cancellation, and it is always presented as a defense of reason, not an attack upon it. Still, a picture has emerged of the national cultural institutions as increasingly ready to bow to pressure from almost anyone, a neat reflection of an America divided by special-interest groups of every stripe.</p><p>A century ago, the report that so concerned the Smithsonian secretary -- James Mooney's pioneering research that dared to suggest the religious practices of American Indians could be legitimately compared with those of Christianity -- was, in the end, not suppressed.</p><p>But in 1995, pressured by critics in and out of Congress, the Smithsonian startled the world by canceling a long-planned interpretive exhibit marking the  50th anniversary of the flight of the @nola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima.</p><p>The Smithsonian exhibition as originally planned raised the question of whether the decision to drop the bomb was correct, a subject historians have debated with considerable vigor. The Smithsonian could have presented all sides  of the issue, but it chose instead to deny that there was more than one, and mounted a more modest show, still on view, in which portions of the restored Enola Gay are displayed and the plane's mission is honored uncritically.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, the Smithsonian postponed an exhibition on an even more painful subject, the Vietnam War. And just in the last few weeks, the Smithsonian's neighbor, the Library of Congress, put off a major exhibition on Sigmund Freud after finding itself caught in the crossfire between Freudian analysts and scholars, who were helping to mount the exhibition, and what might  be called anti-Freudians, who complained that Freud's views had been superseded. This time the challenge came not from people angry that the exhibition was critical but fearful that it would not be critical enough.</p>                </div>
