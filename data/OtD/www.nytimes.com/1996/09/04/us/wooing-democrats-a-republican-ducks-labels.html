                    <p>Can this be a foot soldier in the Gingrich Revolution?</p><p>Representative Peter G. Torkildsen supports abortion rights, criticized the Republican plan to overhaul Medicare and voted against his party more often in 1995 than all but four other Republicans, according to one analysis. He is very eager to point this out.</p><p>''There are more than enough cases where people can look at my voting record and say, well, I'm making my mind up on my own,'' Mr. Torkildsen declares.</p><p>Independence may be a key to survival for a House Republican in the fall of 1996 here in this old manufacturing town on the banks of the Merrimack River, in a Congressional district where George Bush barely topped 30 percent of the vote in 1992.  Sensing rich opportunities among these heavily Democratic and independent voters, organized labor and the Democratic challenger, John Tierney, have been tying Mr. Torkildsen directly, and relentlessly, to Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Gingrich agenda.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''This is New England; this is Massachusetts; this is the Sixth District,'' says Mr. Tierney, who is running against Mr. Torkildsen for the second time after narrowly losing to him in 1994. ''We don't need a clone of Newt Gingrich.''</p><p>Democrats see districts like this one, which covers a broad swathe of the state's North Shore, as the first line of offense in their struggle to regain the 20 seats necessary to restore their majority in the House. Yet the 38-year-old Mr. Torkildsen is, in many ways, a case study of what a Northeast Republican must do to try to endure in difficult terrain in a year when two broad political winds are blowing against him in this region:  the strength of the Democratic Presidential ticket and the unpopularity of Mr. Gingrich.</p><p>''A number of these Northeast Republicans have done a pretty good job of pushing their independence from Speaker Gingrich and the rest of the party,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. ''That's just a defining fact of American politics -- where you're from has a heck of a lot to do with how you vote.''</p><p>It is no coincidence that the five Republican Congressmen who voted most often against their party in 1995, according to an analysis by The Congressional Quarterly, were from the Northeast. Just as it is no coincidence that the Democrats who voted most often against their party were nearly all from the South. Northeast Republicans and Southern Democrats are, in many ways, mirror images, politicians who must often separate themselves from their national parties to stay alive.</p><p>It was the Northeast Republicans in the House who pushed their leaders for a vote to raise the minimum wage and who led the effort in the caucus to soften their party's environmental proposals. Mr. Torkildsen also voted against his party's plan to overhaul the Medicare system (and extract $270 billion in savings from it), although he later voted for the overall budget that incorporated those Medicare savings.</p><p>''Long before people had concerns about certain Republican initiatives, I was out advocating things I believed in, like continuing funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities,'' Mr. Torkildsen said in an interview. ''I was an early supporter of raising the minimum wage.'' Referring to the Federal nutrition program for women, infants and children, he said, ''I was an early supporter of keeping the WIC program intact, which we succeeded in doing.''</p><p>Mr. Torkildsen struck a similarly moderate tone at a weekday morning fund raising event in Haverhill, where he said his campaign themes would be ''leadership, independence and integrity,'' and he warned his supporters that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would spend heavily to defeat him. A block away, a group of Tierney supporters marked their territory, waving their placards to greet the approaching guests. ''There's not that many rich people in Haverhill,'' said Tom Jones, a carpenter, as he watched about 40 people assemble for the fund raising event. ''Just working stiffs like us.''</p><p>Still, Mr. Torkildsen, a former state representative and State Commissioner of Labor and Industries, noted he had carried Haverhill twice. He was first elected from the Sixth District in 1992, when he ran against a Democratic incumbent who happened to be under indictment. Mr. Torkildsen held on two years later, although he defeated Mr. Tierney by a scant four percentage points in a year that saw a Republican tidal wave in the rest of the country.</p><p>Mr. Tierney, a 44-year-old lawyer and former president of the Salem Chamber of Commerce, argues that Mr. Torkildsen's vaunted independence is more talk than action.</p><p>''Everytime Newt Gingrich needs him, he's there,'' Mr. Tierney said in an interview.</p><p>Moreover, the Democrat argues, nothing less than control of the House and the future of the Gingrich agenda is at stake in the choice between Mr. Tierney and Mr. Torkildsen.</p><p>''Even if you believe all his protestations about being moderate, he's still going to vote to put in Gingrich and Armey and Archer, Bliley and Young and DeLay,'' Mr. Tierney said, reciting a disdainful litany of the Republican leadership in the House and its top committee chairmen: Dick Armey, Bill Archer, Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Don Young and Tom DeLay. ''And he knows by doing this he's going to get their agenda.''</p><p>Mr. Torkildsen counters that because the Republicans are likely to retain control of the House, he can do a better job ''making sure my party doesn't go too far astray, especially on social issues,'' than a Democrat could.</p><p>There are no recent independent polls, although each campaign says its internal surveys show the other is vulnerable. Mr. Tierney is widely believed to face only nominal opposition in the Sept. 17 primary.</p><p>Mr. Tierney and Mr. Torkildsen were roughly at parity in terms of cash on hand in the most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. The Democratic Presidential ticket is expected to do very well in this heavily Democratic state, but Republicans argue that the popularity of Gov. William F. Weld, a Republican who is challenging Senator John Kerry, will insure that Republican turnout is high.</p><p>Mr. Torkildsen speaks warmly of the Dole-Kemp ticket, but he reserves judgment on its tax-cut plan, saying, with characteristic caution,  ''I want to see what spending cuts he wants to offset them.''</p><p>Mr. Gingrich remains a real vulnerability for Republicans in this state. Bill Vernon, executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party, said he would not advise a Republican candidate to bring the Speaker into Massachusetts. Mr. Vernon said he occasionally got complaints from party loyalists that candidates were running away from their party's Speaker but that he argued, ''The Republican candidates' jobs are not to change Gingrich's popularity numbers; their jobs are to get elected.''</p><p>Bob Desmaris, a salesman who attended Mr. Torkildsen's fund-raising event in Haverhill, said he thought Mr. Torkildsen was doing that job well.</p><p>''We capture a lot of independents, because Peter isn't so died in the wool conservative that he sticks out,'' Mr. Desmaris said. ''On some things he's voted with Gingrich, and on some things he doesn't. That's what it takes.''</p><p>Photos: Representative Peter G.
