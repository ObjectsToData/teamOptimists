In a profession that rewards egomania and faux family values, she is genuinely self-effacing, and a genuine wife and mother in the generally accepted meaning of those terms.</p><p>Yet even if you look hard, it's difficult to find anyone in Hollywood who has  cashed in -- both professionally and financially -- as completely and seemingly inevitably as has this 48-year old character actress.</p><p>Do you have trouble understanding why? Well, it might help to watch an episode or two of ''Pearl,'' Ms. Perlman's new sitcom, which will run on  Monday nights at 8:30 on CBS for at least five weeks, in the time slot eventually to be held by ''Ink,'' a new show that is being retooled.</p><p>''Pearl,'' whose basic concept is credited to Ms. Perlman, is centered on a diminutive woman who decides to tackle a complicated, high-pressure world:  in this case, academia.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Am I a big thinker? I'm not a big thinker,'' said Ms. Perlman, sitting in her large airy dressing room a few feet from her sitcom's sound stage. ''I mean I like to think, I like to talk about stuff, I like to read, stuff like that. But I'm not the kind of person who sits around and mulls. I don't like to sit around and agonize and labor over things.''</p><p>This gracious and somewhat shy woman, still best known to the world as Carla Tortelli, the acerbic and definitively non-shy waitress in the long-running NBC series ''Cheers,'' leaned back into her comfortable couch and took the thought a bit further.</p><p>''Am I a dreamer? I mean, I think I am,'' she said. ''I'm a dreamer in the sense that I feel you can do whatever you want to do. And it frustrates me to see people bogged down.''</p><p>Dreams -- unfulfilled, but only temporarily -- are what everyone concerned with ''Pearl'' considers its dominant motif.</p><p>Ms. Perlman plays Pearl Carraldo, a widowed middle-age electronics store clerk who, thirsting for knowledge, applies to a local university and is accepted.</p><p>Opposed vigorously by her divorced, resolutely blue-collar son (played by Dash Mihok), and supported halfheartedly by her best friend, played by Carol Kane (''Taxi''), Pearl nevertheless enrolls in the toughest humanities course in the college, and runs right into Prof.  Stephen Pynchon, played by the English actor Malcolm McDowell (''If,'' ''O Lucky Man,'' ''Time After Time'').</p><p>Pynchon is a self-infatuated snob and martinet (''Like most self-made men, I am in awe of my creator,'' he announces to his class in the pilot episode), who has an unpleasant penchant for running intimidated students out of his course. Pearl becomes one of his targets, of course, and the conflicts and eventual backhanded bonding between the two will constitute the meat of the series.</p><p>What distinguishes this series from most others on the air, however, is that between punch lines Pearl and Pynchon actually discuss philosophy, ethics and literature. ''Pearl'' may be the only sitcom in which names like Herman Melville, Thomas Moore and Abraham Maslow, and the ideas they had, are invoked.</p><p>This quality of continuing education was a central point of Ms. Perlman's pitch to the network.</p><p>''It's amazing,'' said Don Reo (''Blossom,'' ''The John Larroquette Show''), who is Ms. Perlman's fellow executive producer on ''Pearl.'' ''In the classroom scenes, Pearl and Pynchon have six, seven-minute-long monologues.''</p><p>CBS executives also give an unqualified endorsement of the concept, at least when they're speaking publicly.  ''It doesn't scare us at all,'' said Billy Campbell, an executive vice president.  ''It's a wonderful message: she's there to learn.''</p><p>Which is not to say that CBS always looked favorably on ''Pearl.'' Ms. Perlman is one of several established sitcom stars (including Bill Cosby and her fellow ''Cheers'' alumnus Ted Danson) being counted on this season to draw viewers to the network, which now ranks third. The initial drafts of the ''Pearl'' pilot reportedly left CBS's new programming chief, Leslie Moonves, underwhelmed.</p><p>In the hope of a better reaction, and of working out some of the kinks, Ms. Perlman and her husband, Danny DeVito, organized a staged reading of the pilot script in their home. They recruited some longtime friends, including Ms. Kane and Mr. McDowell, to help. The move apparently turned the tide with CBS, and Ms. Perlman quickly moved to engage the two actors on a longer-term basis.</p><p>''The whole thing went through a lot of drafts and incarnations,'' said Ms. Perlman. '' The only reason for me to do another show was because I had every reason to feel it was good, really good. And I really wanted it to be.''</p><p>The successful show to aim for, of course, is ''Cheers.'' Ms. Perlman was a vital component of the ''Cheers'' ensemble cast, one of many actors whose reputations -- and fortunes -- were made by the long-running hit.</p><p>A framed cover of Life magazine, with the ''Cheers'' cast assembled for its final episode, has pride of place on  Ms. Perlman's dressing room wall.</p><p>''I never dreamed this is where I would get to,'' Ms. Perlman said. ''I always figured, if I was going to be an actress, I would just be one of those struggling ones in New York, playing character parts. But, look, I was always sure that 'Cheers' was a hit TV show, even when we were in last place for the first two years.''</p><p>When ''Cheers'' had its premiere in 1982, Ms. Perlman's struggling years were over. She was born in Coney Island and was brought up primarily in Bensonhurst. After she graduated from Hunter College, she began taking a number of jobs, including one as a waitress at the Rainbow Room, to support her acting career. She and Mr. DeVito  met in 1970 and began living together  shortly thereafter. They married in 1982 and have three children: Lucy, 13; Gracie, 11, and Jake, 8.</p><p>The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1976. The hit ABC sitcom ''Taxi,'' with Dr. DeVito as irascible dispatcher, began in 1978. Ms. Perlman made several guest appearances on the show. In 1984 she starred with her husband in his first full-length directorial effort, a comedy for Showtime called ''The Ratings Game.''</p><p>Since 1993, when production of ''Cheers'' ended, Ms. Perlman has had  roles in several movies, most notably ''Matilda,'' the recent critically acclaimed Roald Dahl adaptation that Mr. DeVito directed and also stars in.</p><p>Now, she says, she has everything and nothing riding on ''Pearl.''</p><p>''I'm a pretty positive person,'' Ms. Perlman says. ''I like to watch all kinds of stuff. I like very dark and sick things, too. But I choose to spend -- hopefully -- the next five years of my life being involved in something I'm happy with. I like doing stuff that sort of pushes you forward.''</p><p>Photos: On the cover: Rhea Perlman plays a widow who goes to college.
