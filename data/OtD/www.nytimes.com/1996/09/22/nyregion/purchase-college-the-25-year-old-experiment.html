                    <p>TWENTY-FIVE years ago this month, Purchase College officially opened during a downpour. The rain prevented 10 portable classrooms from being delivered to the unfinished campus, and the first entering class -- 170 third-year students who had transferred from other schools -- met under a tent.</p><p>Such plucky coping has been the school's chief mode of operation since 1973, when Nelson A. Rockefeller, whose vision of public higher education is embodied in this arts-oriented branch of the State University, left the Governor's office to become Vice President of the United States. State support dwindled almost immediately, and the college, like other branches of the university, is now struggling to fulfill its mission as a public-private hybrid.</p><p>Rockefeller was not only personally passionate about the arts -- serving as a trustee of both the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- but he also dared to establish a public college devoted to cultivating arts education at the highest level. He and the administrators he recruited went further than establishing performing arts conservatories and a visual arts faculty, to be buttressed in 1972 by the opening on campus of the Neuberger Museum of Art. They believed aspiring artists should be nurtured by the broad study of science and the humanities, and thus liberal arts became equally important at the school.</p><p>Ever since, debate has raged here about how truly to connect the various disciplines, so that economists might comfortably quote from Euripides and painters might find inspiration in Plato's cave. ''If we could pull it off, it would be unique in higher education in the public sector, and maybe even in the private,'' said Bill Lacy, the college's current president. He added that the issue was constantly under discussion.</p>                </div>

                    <p>If Rockefeller did not draw up the marriage contract in detail, he did lay the groundwork for such fertile intermingling, said former college officials involved in the early planning stages of the school. ''There's no question that it was his dream, but he had some real help,'' said John W. Straus, the first dean for administration and the arts. The person primarily responsible for carrying out the dream was the late Dr. Abbott Kaplan, who was recruited from his position as associate dean of the College of Fine Arts of the University of California at Los Angeles to become the first president of Purchase College. Dr. Kaplan also served as chairman of the California Arts Commission.</p><p>Dr. Frank W. Wadsworth, a literary scholar who was the first vice president for academic affairs, recently recalled what Dr. Kaplan asked of him in developing a liberal arts curriculum. ''The goal,'' Dr. Wadsworth said, ''was a first-rate college experience on a public campus, so people who couldn't go to the Harvards and Wellesleys could get a personalized and independent education. It was an innovative program with an emphasis on independent study in the broadest, most philosophical sense, so that students would take more responsibility for their education than in the usual undergraduate school.''</p><p>Dr. Wadsworth, who also taught literature here until 1990, recalled the ''wild-eyed, anti-everything'' students of the early 1970's, whose generation lent spice to Rockefeller's remarks at a ground-breaking ceremony here in 1969: he applauded Dr. Kaplan's courage in taking on the job ''at the regular salary, no combat pay.''</p><p>Those living in the area were at first wary at the prospect of any wild-eyed rebels in their leafy neighborhood, given the roiling passions of antiwar demonstrators and student activists nationwide. Mr. Straus, who was also one of the first members of the Purchase College Foundation, recently recalled that people ''were unhappy with the concept that we'd bring these 'crazy' students into the community.''</p><p>But Strathglass Farm, a 500-acre farm devoted to raising prize-winning Ayrshire cattle, among other things, was being sold by its owner, the paper-manufacturing magnate Hugh Chisholm, and the neighbors decided that a college on the site would be preferable to a housing development, Mr. Straus recalled.</p><p>''People began to realize that it was a great opportunity, because there was so much open space left,'' Mr. Straus said. As designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, master architect of a team that also included Philip Johnson, Robert Venturi and others, the campus sprawls out of sight of Anderson Hill Road in angular patterns worthy of the painter Chirico.</p><p>Students strolling to class on a recent sunny afternoon softened the sharp-edged center mall, which is lined with maple trees and banners heralding the school's 25th anniversary.</p><p>The student body of 2,200 matriculating students is comprised of diverse ethnic groups, and faculty members say the racial mixture is one of the school's strong points. A continuing challenge, however, is the recruiting and retaining of students, Mr. Lacy said.</p><p>''We need to be a college of 6,000 students, and that's part of the growth plan for over the next five years,'' he said. ''That's the number the academic planners built and designed the school for.''</p><p>Students pay $10,400 a year in tuition, room and board if they are New York residents, and $15,300 a year if they are not.</p>                </div>
