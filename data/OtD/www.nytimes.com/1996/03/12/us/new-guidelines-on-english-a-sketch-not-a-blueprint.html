                    <p>There is no specific call for first-grade readers, phonics or Faulkner. No demand for sentence diagramming or Dante.</p><p>Instead, a long-awaited report on national standards for English language instruction gives only general guidelines. It says, for example, that by the time they finish high school, American students should have read a "wide range of literature" and be able to communicate with a "variety of audiences," using books and newspapers as well as computer data-bases. They should be able to use  a library and write and critique texts. And even students who speak another language at home should be "competent" in English.</p><p>The new curriculum guidelines, released today in Washington after a long, somewhat stormy development, are the last voluntary guidelines for a major discipline to be made public.</p><p>English teachers, as well as employers and parents, have long complained that many high school graduates cannot read or write effectively, use poor grammar and have little knowledge of literature. Consequently, the drive to develop national curriculum standards, which gathered steam during the Bush Administration and has continued under President Clinton, is widely supported as a way of addressing such shortcomings.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"The key thing is that we use language in order to communicate and think," said Beverly Ann Chin, president of the National Council of Teachers of English, which developed the report along with the International Reading Association. "We want all students to be able to use language effectively. This document furthers our vision of what literacy means. For example, in many classrooms today, children are on computers talking and e-mailing people around the world."</p><p>The report does make some specific recommendations, including supporting bilingual education for non-English speakers, the study of both classics and contemporary literature and the need for students to be competent in "standard English," which the report delicately refers to as "this language of wider communication."</p><p>Still, the report is surprisingly brief and general, offering none of the reading lists, benchmarks or preferred teaching methods that have been used in other subject areas.  According to the recently released science standards, for  example, fourth-grade students are expected to have a basic understanding of the properties of objects and materials.</p><p>The world history standards, for another, retain the study of the Greek city-states and the Roman Empire, but add the Mauryan Empire in India and the Olmec culture, which influenced the Zapotec and Mayan civilizations.</p><p>The American history standards, however, drew fire from conservatives who used such specifics to argue that the document ignored the nation's white, male  heroes. Arguing that it presented a "warped view" of history, Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, said the document contained 17 references to the Ku Klux Klan and 19 to McCarthyism but none to Paul Revere or Thomas Edison. As a result of such criticism, the standards are being revised.</p><p>By contrast, in its 70-pages, excluding a glossary and acknowledgments, the English language arts standards steer clear of such specifics.</p><p>"We believe that decisions about specific curriculums -- which books are read and studied, for example -- should be made at a local level," said Ms. Chin.</p><p>That very generality may insure the standards' survival. Few will disagree, for example, that students should be able to "apply knowledge of language structure, language conventions (e.g. spelling and punctuation), media techniques, figurative language, and genre to create, critique and discuss print and nonprint texts."</p><p>Some educators praise the standards' nonintrusiveness, saying the standards will let states and local school districts make the critical curriculum decisions.</p><p>"It serves the purpose a national standards document needs to serve," said Cheryl Sigmon, a language arts consultant for the South Carolina Department of Education. "It's given us all some general sense of direction. It provides the philosophical basis that we all need. Then I think it's up to the states to do the rest."</p><p>Still, the report already has some critics, including educators and government officials who say the standards offer too little too late.</p><p>"The report contains very vague and very general statements that don't tell parents or students what is important to learn and don't tell teachers what is important to teach and by when," said Michael Cohen, a senior adviser to Education Secretary Richard W. Riley who has been observing curriculum standards.</p><p>Christopher Cross, president of the Council for Basic Education, a national nonprofit group that promotes the teaching of basic subjects, agreed, saying that several states, including Colorado, Delaware, Ohio and Virginia, had done a more thorough job of determining English standards.</p><p>"A document like this should give people a benchmark against which to determine whether they have covered the waterfront," he said.</p><p>In Illinois, the state's Board of Education has already developed standards for all subject areas for its more than two million students, which includes specific reading lists and grade benchmarks, and will be able to make only cursory use of the new report before going to press in the coming weeks.</p><p>"It would have been nice to have seen what direction they were going before now," said Lynne Haeffele, the project manager for the academic standards project in Illinois. "But if you look across these national standards projects,  all of them are so uneven anyway. They are a nice resource. Good thought went into them. But they are not directly useful in the classroom."</p><p>The delay in the standards report has resulted in part from insistence by its organizers that thousands of teachers and educators be consulted and that no "top-down" mandates intrude on classrooms.</p><p>A committee to establish English Language Arts standards was first set up by  the Department of Education in 1992, under the Bush Administration. But in 1994, after an outside assessment determined that the group was not progressing effectively, financing was cut off. Since then, the National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association have continued on their own, using their own resources.</p>                </div>
