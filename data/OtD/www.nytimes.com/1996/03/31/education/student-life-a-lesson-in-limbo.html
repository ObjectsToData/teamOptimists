Jennifer Marshall, a student of German literature, is in her fifth year at Yale. Both Ph.D. candidates are preparing to test the academic job market this December, at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, the premier job fair for their disciplines. Their days already have the variety and independence that represent much of what they prize in the academic life. They just never seem to end.</p><p>The 1990's were supposed to be a good decade to go to graduate school: a generation of senior faculty was about to retire, opening an abundance of assistant professorships for the first time since the 60's. Applications to graduate programs soared. The number of new Ph.D.'s grew each year. But the downsizing of academe has instead produced the worst job market in decades. As professors retire, financially pressed universities are cutting tenure-track positions. In their place, they use graduate students like Mr. Battles and Ms. Marshall, and part-time adjuncts -- often new Ph.D.'s who can't find full-time posts.</p><p>Especially for those in the humanities, supply has turned on demand; they are needed more as graduate students then as faculty. Some graduate teaching assistants, like those at Yale who staged a grade strike last winter, accuse universities of exploiting them as cheap labor and try to form unions. The more  common response is to work themselves harder than any boss would, to build a resume that will stand out.</p><p>At a certain point, there is no turning back from what can seem like impossible competition, and Mr. Battles and Ms. Marshall have reached it. If they are lucky, they will find permanent jobs. If not, the long apprenticeship that prepares a person for only one job, that of university professor, will have to be its own reward.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Battles's weeks are structured around teaching, as they have been since  his first semester. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, from 1 to 3 P.M., he teaches two classes of Rhetoric 105, a composition course for those of Illinois's 6,000 freshmen who do not pass a writing placement test. It is for required introductory courses like this that public universities, in particular, depend on graduate students. Each class has 22 students.</p><p>He has office hours after class on Mondays and by appointment an hour or two each week. Wednesday afternoons, he attends a seminar, an exploration of Piers Plowman, the 14th-century English epic.</p><p>That leaves Tuesdays and Thursdays "to spend pretty much as I want," Mr. Battles said. And Sundays, too: He works six days a week to fit his research into his teaching and course work.</p><p>This semester, he is pushing hard on his dissertation, an analysis of an Anglo-Saxon poetic translation of the Book of Genesis. But he is also preparing  papers to deliver at three academic conferences, and a fourth paper to submit for publication.</p><p>At Illinois, teaching is the main source of financial aid for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences. (In the sciences, as elsewhere,  most aid comes from research grants, and students teach much less.) In all but two semesters, Mr. Battles has taught two courses, a full faculty load. For that he is paid $10,336 a year, and his tuition is waived. Because of the teaching, Illinois expects students to take seven years to earn a Ph.D.</p><p>The average salary of an English professor at Illinois is $47,500.</p><p>Sharing an apartment a few blocks from campus with a roommate, he gets by with help from his parents in Germany, which he finds awkward at the age of 27.  "I stay afloat," he said. "If the car doesn't break down, I'm O.K."</p><p>Illinois has a budding Graduate Employees' Organization that lobbies the administration to listen to its needs, but it has no bargaining power. He has not joined, in part because he thinks the English Department treats him well; teaching assistant jobs are available every year, and after, if the job search goes poorly, adjunct positions offer a safety net.</p><p>He knows, he said, that public universities have few options as states hold  down budgets while enrollments stay high: pay professors less, increase class sizes, use more teaching assistants. But he also understands the complaints of exploitation.</p><p>"People who get into this are idealists, closet romantics -- at least, I am," he said. "And I think one of the things that offends them is to discover their universities are acting just like corporations."</p><p>On a Friday afternoon, he met his rhetoric classes in the library and showed  them how to use databases in research. "The big problem in research," he told them, "is finding what you want." He handed back papers and they turned in new ones. He will read 264 student papers this semester.</p><p>In New Haven, walking across the Yale campus, Jennifer Marshall paused to consider what life would be like if she taught two courses instead of one. She had just left her German II class, which meets five days a week. She began calculating: Her 14 students, freshmen and upperclassmen, write essays every two weeks . . . she takes 15 minutes to read each . . . there is weekly homework and tests . . . that's manageable, but double that and. . .</p>                </div>
