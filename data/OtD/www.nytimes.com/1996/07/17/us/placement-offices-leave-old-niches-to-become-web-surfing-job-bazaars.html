                    <p>In this era of corporate downsizing, colleges are being pressed as never before to insure that their students can slide into jobs when they graduate. Parents -- some of whom have been laid off themselves and are paying hefty tuition bills -- want reassurance that they are making a good investment.</p><p>Colleges everywhere have responded with a fervor by retooling the placement office of old into high-tech centers, pushing internships and even making career service officers part of the recruitment process.  Some, like the University of California at San Diego, are bringing marketing experts onto their staffs to help them draw both students and employers into their offices.</p><p>In the crassest terms, people are asking, 'What is the payback?' " said Arthur Rothkopf, president of Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. "We think it is important to deliver."</p><p>While expanded offices and fancy new technologies do not guarantee jobs, they are necessary for colleges to stay competitive, and students and employers alike say they find them useful. Career counselors also say that such steps helped make this the best year in a decade for graduates' getting jobs, though a stronger job market was critical. A survey of 50 major corporations showed their hiring was up about 7 percent this year, said Maury Hanigan, a New York City consultant who advises large corporations on recruiting.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The career development efforts, as they are now called, are a far cry from old placement offices on the edge of campus. Those offices scheduled student interviews when scores of companies like AT&amp;T or General Motors were hiring platoons of college graduates in the 1970's and early 1980's. But now, fewer big companies are recruiting at colleges, and those that are doing so hire fewer students. Students need more help.</p><p>"The idea that you can place someone in a job, like you can place children in a high chair is going by the wayside," said Thomas J. Denham, assistant director of the career development center at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.</p><p>Amid all the fancy footwork, most colleges still offer old standbys like tips on writing resumes and dressing for success. Many, like Colgate in Hamilton, N.Y., and Mount Holyoke, in South Hadley, Mass., have also expanded their programs of career advice and are now helping students apply for fellowships and awards to bolster their resumes.</p><p>There is a growing role for career services officials in the admissions process, too. They now routinely appear at recruiting meetings with admissions officers to tout their programs and their success rates.</p><p>"A few years ago, no one wanted to hear from us," said Trudy Steinfeld, director of the office of career services at New York University.</p><p>But the biggest change on many campuses has been the addition of computer job banks that allow employers to post openings and students to see the listings almost immediately and to learn more about the companies. Students say they love the quick availability and constant updating of the job listings.</p><p>On a recent rainy afternoon, for example, Henry Taibo sat in front of a computer at New York University, scanning hundreds of jobs at companies like Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Simon &amp; Schuster and Deutsche Bank. Mr. Taibo, 22, of Queens, graduated this year with a major in finance and international business.  He had one job lined up as a financial analyst, but was watching in case other attractive jobs arose.</p><p>"You don't want to miss an opportunity," he said, noting that the list changes constantly. When he sees a job he likes, he races to fax his resume. "If you don't act fast, you can lose it," Mr. Taibo said.</p><p>Students can tap into the N.Y.U. system from computers on campus or at their  residences 24 hours a day. If they do not know how to use the Internet -- and N.Y.U., like other colleges, is finding that many do not -- the career office will teach them.</p><p>Last year the university posted 20,000 full-time jobs, 17,000 part-time jobs  and 5,000 internships (up from 500 six years ago), and registered 156,000 searches for a student body of about 26,000 full-time undergraduate and graduate students. But the university, like others, says it is difficult to count direct  hires.</p><p>Employers are also drawn to the electronic job listings, colleges say, because they are so easy to use. A career services official at Clark University  in Worcester, Mass., for example, says the college's Web page has attracted employers "just surfing around" to send job listings.</p><p>Another innovation gaining use at colleges is video-conference hookups that permit companies to interview students without coming to campus. In February, for example, Procter &amp; Gamble held 26 interviews at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland using Viewnet, a commercial system that shows a resume on the left of the screen, the student's image in the bottom right, and the corporate interviewer's image at the top right.</p><p>"Students loved it because they could wear jeans on the bottom and business attire on top," said Alexa Hansen, assistant director of career planning and placement at Case.</p><p>In general, employers applaud the changes in career services.</p>                </div>
