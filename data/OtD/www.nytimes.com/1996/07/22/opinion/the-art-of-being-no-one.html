For "Anonymous" is at once no one and everyone; "Anonymous" is greater  than the sum of any number of merely finite authors, suggesting, in a secular mode, Pascal's great definition of God -- a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.</p><p>"Anonymous" floats above the mass of mortal individuals, like a spy satellite; "Anonymous" is the very atmosphere out of which the work by "Anonymous" has been generated. "Anonymous" will always be the author of the corrosively funny political satire "Primary Colors," though the name and identity "Joe Klein, Newsweek columnist and CBS commentator" has now been rudely attached.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Motives for publishing anonymously and pseudonymously may be as varied as the authors themselves, and not all are for purposes of publicity and commercial gain. Creating a fictional world to exist exclusively in language, between the covers of a book and beneath a carefully chosen title, the writer also deliberately chooses the name of the writing self, though this is not a fact that seems to occur to most readers.</p><p>Yet how carefully chosen is the mellifluous "Lewis Carroll" (real name: Charles Dodgson), author of the ingenious "Alice" books; how shrewdly chosen, in the 19th-century English culture in which bias against "Authoresses" was widespread, the faery-names "Currer Bell," "Ellis Bell" and "Acton Bell" (Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte respectively).</p><p>The Pseudonyms and Nicknames Dictionary, more than 600 pages of small-print triple-columned pages, takes us from "A. A." (Anthony Armstrong Willis, Canadian author, 1897-1976) to "Z. Y. X." (Arthur Alkin Sykes, British author, 1861-?). In between are thousands of pseudonyms, many of them by genre writers and many by women presenting themselves as male or androgynous, like Amandine Aurore-Lucie Dupin, Baroness Dudevant ("George Sand"), Baroness Karen Blixen ("Isak Dinesen") and Marian Evans ("George Eliot").</p><p>The most famous self-naming American writer is Samuel Lang horne Clemens, creator of "Mark Twain" (the riverboat leadsman's cry); like other pseudonymous  writers, Clemens/Twain seems to have suggested in this naming an essential split in his own identity.</p><p>The 18th century was our great age of political and social satire, and consequently an age of strategic "anonymous" and "pseudonymous" writings. While  imprisoned in the Bastille for political imprudence, the young Francois Marie Arouet re-named himself "Voltaire" and embarked upon a career that would, in time, fill 99 volumes, changing the intellectual climate of Europe forever.</p><p>In England, the great Augustan ironists Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and John Gay joined with some others in creating a series of papers by one "Martin Scriblerus." Swift distinguished himself as a master of voices and personae of remarkable comic subtlety. Sometimes, as in the famous "Bickerstaff Papers," he  chose a distinctive pseudonym ("Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.," an ardent if cracked astrologer); at other times, as in his masterwork of 1729, "A Modest Proposal" (the proposal being that the children of poor folk be purchased for food by their betters), he used the enigmatic author-name "Dr. Swift," though the voice  of his proposal is that of an idealist-lunatic, hardly that of the well-known Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.</p><p>More pointedly than most, Swift's satirical pieces raise the question of the  distinction between satire and hoax, parody and outright deception.</p><p>A satire seems to be something we can enjoy at another's expense, while a hoax may be at our own.</p><p>No work by an "Anonymous" can be a hoax, though many works by "Anonymous" are satires. The term "Anonymous" suggests, perversely, a measure of honesty: the writer is not pretending to be anyone, but acknowledges he is "no one." The creator of a hoax always identifies himself, for his identity, his professional  reputation in particular, is part of the hoax; the creator of a satire need not  identify himself, for his identity is not usually an essential element in the satire.</p><p>When Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University, published his devastating (and wonderfully funny) critique of postmodernist social science theory, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity," simultaneously in the journals Lingua Franca and Social Text, the identical essay was a satire in the former and a hoax in the latter. (Professor  Sokal's satiric object was Swiftian in its doubleness: the physicist not only parodied incomprehensible postmodernist jargon but the very pretensions of Social Text's self-styled theorist-editors.)</p><p>Had he published his essay under a pseudonym, failing to identify himself as  a professor of physics, it would still be satire, but would not be a hoax. Had he published it under the author-name "Anonymous" it could only be satire, not a hoax. And who would be content to create mere satire if by a manipulation of "author-identity" he could create a hoax? For a hoax is satire that has exploded and caused injury.</p><p>The author of "Primary Colors" would not have wished to limit the authority of his roman a clef by affixing his own name. For a Newsweek columnist, an individual in the political trade, so to speak, would not be granted the uncanny power of "Anonymous." All fiction writers create not simply their fictions but,  as readers should be well aware, their very author-selves; to use a "real" name  on the dust jacket, and a "real" photo, is to have made a choice as deliberate as the anonymous or pseudonymous writer. There is nothing in the slightest dishonest, insincere, deceptive or in any way unethical in publishing a book, roman a clef or otherwise, under the author-identity "Anonymous."</p><p>As for "Primary Colors" itself, what more appropriate authorship than "Anonymous" for an intimate picture of a recent Presidential campaign, privy to  mildly shocking yet never surprising secrets? Our perception of national politics in an age of public opinion polls and mass-market advertising is that it is, in its essence, a phenomenon of smoke and mirrors, not substance. Politicians themselves are "Anonymous," or, if it would assure them success at the polls, how eagerly they would become so.</p><p>Drawing.  </p>                </div>
