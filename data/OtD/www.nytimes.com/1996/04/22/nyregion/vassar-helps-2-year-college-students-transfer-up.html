Bernetta Parson, 29, was determined to move beyond a frustrating receptionist's job.</p><p>All three women embarked on a course that could reshape their lives: they went from community colleges to prestigious four-year colleges through a summer program intended to give promising students entree to the best schooling.</p><p>The program, called Exploring Transfer, began 10 years ago as a partnership  between Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Since then, it has prepared students for top four-year colleges and has inspired similar partnerships at Smith College in Massachusetts and Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Many of the men and women in the program have gone on to become Ph.D. candidates, doctors, lawyers, teachers and social workers. The next group is being chosen this month, based on academic promise.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Typically, participants in Exploring Transfer spend five weeks at Vassar College taking courses in humanities, social science or biological science, earning two credits from Vassar and getting a leg up in admission to the school  later. After completing their associate degrees, they may apply for admittance to Vassar or any four-year school of their choice, and spend two years working toward a bachelor's degree.</p><p>For years, Exploring Transfer has been financed by an array of donors who pay for the students' costs, about $2,500 for room and board, books, computer access and tutorials. Now, officials from La Guardia and Vassar are trying to raise $700,000 to establish an endowment.  If they succeed, they will qualify for a $300,000 matching grant from the Ford Foundation. The money would allow administrators to avoid the annual frenzy of grant applications. It would also provide security for the program at a time of sharp fiscal cutbacks in higher education.</p><p>Of the 401 students who have participated, only 2 have dropped out of the summer program, both for personal reasons, officials said. About two-thirds of the students are women and more than half are older than the typical 18-to-22-year-old student population.</p><p>More than 70 percent of the students later received bachelor's degrees at four-year institutions, primarily Vassar but also including Hunter College, Brooklyn College, Yale, Columbia and Cornell. Once students move on to four-year schools, they receive substantial financial aid packages that may include work-study. Annual tuition at Vassar, for instance, is $19,940; La Guardia costs $2,611.70.</p><p>Each year in the Vassar program, 35 students are selected from more than 100  teacher-nominated applicants at La Guardia, Dutchess, Borough of Manhattan, Orange, Ulster and Westchester Community Colleges. Professors from those colleges and Vassar are the teachers.</p><p>Ms. Panvini, who wanted to be a pop singer, is now the associate editor of The Vassar Quarterly.</p><p>In 1985, she moved from her father's home in a neat suburb of Denver to live  with her mother in an apartment in an industrial area of Long Island City. After months of urging from her mother, Ms. Panvini enrolled in night school at La Guardia, working as a clerk by day and doing some singing. After two years, a creative writing professor told her about Exploring Transfer.</p><p>"He told me Vassar was some Ivy League school in New England," Ms. Panvini said. "He encouraged me to go to the informational meeting and I did. I soon realized it wasn't in New England, but Poughkeepsie."</p><p>She was accepted into the program in 1989 and transferred to Vassar in 1990,  graduating in 1992 with a bachelor's degree in English.</p><p>Mrs. Adams's decision to return to school in 1991 came after gentle prodding  by her husband, Rudy. At first, she took only one class at night while she worked at I.B.M. as a program manager. She had been there 14 years. In 1992, she took a buyout offer and enrolled at Dutchess full time. Three months later, her  husband died of emphysema.</p><p>"I threw myself into my school work," Mrs. Adams said from her home in LaGrange, N.Y. "I had nowhere else to turn." Her diligence paid off with her acceptance in Exploring Transfer in 1993. "I cannot tell you enough about how I  felt living in a dorm with so many people from so many backgrounds and different walks of life," she said.</p><p>Mrs. Adams transferred to Vassar in 1994 as an English major and expects to graduate in May 1997, just a year behind her son, Tony Monell, a student at the  University of Colorado at Boulder. She plans to become a teacher.</p><p>Serendipity, Ms. Parson said, led her to La Guardia in 1992. A single mother, she had just quit her job as a receptionist at a Wall Street bank because she failed to win a 25 cent raise and a promotion.</p><p>"I knew that I had to get a grip and come up with a better life," Ms. Parson  said.</p><p>To attend college, she went on welfare and enrolled her daughter, Ursula Carolyn, at the college's preschool. Good grades and the respect of her professors brought Ms. Parson to Exploring Transfer. A year later, she enrolled  at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. She is scheduled to graduate next month with a bachelor's degree in English.</p><p>"Now, I feel like the whole world is open for me," she said recently from her home in South Hadley, Mass.</p><p>Some students have encountered problems making the transition from a community college near their families to a somewhat distant four-year college. To help, Vassar provides some nurturing through counseling by former participants.</p><p>Yvette Martinez, 26, of Brooklyn, said she needed the support. She is a single parent of a 5-year-old son, Daniel. In 1993, while she was attending La Guardia, one of her professors encouraged her to apply to the Exploring Transfer program. She transferred to Vassar in 1995 and is scheduled to graduate in 1998  with a degree in political science. She hopes to work with social service providers in the Hispanic community.</p><p>Attending Vassar meant leaving Daniel with her mother. Ms. Martinez visits him on weekends.</p><p>"When he gets ill or things come up at school, I'm here," she said. "It's frustrating and it's tough being away from my family and friends."</p><p>Yet, looking back, she still recalled her excitement at taking part in Exploring Transfer.</p><p>"Getting the acceptance letter into the program was like winning the lottery," she said.</p><p>Photo: Exploring Transfer, a summer program at Vassar College, includesgraduates like Willa Panvini, who later transferred from La Guardia Community College and is the associate editor of The Vassar Quarterly.
