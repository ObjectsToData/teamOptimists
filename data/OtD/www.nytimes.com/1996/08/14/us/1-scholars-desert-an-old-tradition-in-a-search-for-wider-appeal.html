                    <p>In a celebrated spoof of scholarly writing a generation ago, the humorist Frank Sullivan quipped, ''Give a footnote an inch, and it'll take a foot.'' Academicians were not amused.</p><p>Scholarly citation, they had come to believe, was one of the building blocks of civilization.</p><p>Today, a growing number of scholars, particularly in the humanities have joined the Sullivan heresy, scorning footnotes and banishing almost all forms of citation from their work. Sometimes their motive is philosophical, though at other times it is crassly commercial.</p><p>''I don't use footnotes because I like to think my books are invitations to readers rather than indictments of other historians,'' said Daniel J. Boorstin, the historian and former Librarian of Congress.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Gordon A. Craig, a widely published emeritus professor of history at Stanford University, agrees.</p><p>''In my first days as an author, I had a tendancy to choke the page with footnotes,'' Professor Craig said. ''Now I've written several books with no footnotes at all. I figure I'm writing for the cultivated lay public, and they're not interested in footnotes.''</p><p>Domna Stanton, editor of Publications of the Modern Language Association, said that the new style of autobiographical essays, which ''lack almost all scholarly armature,'' was now so prevalent in academe that she was devoting much of the October issue of her periodical to consideration of the phenomenon.</p><p>But the anti-footnote crowd, even if rapidly multiplying, is not taking over without a fight. Academic journals are still a stronghold for scholars who use footnotes to demonstrate their accountability and their sources (or flaunt their erudition). Students are still being taught the technique for research papers, and a book by a Princeton historian, Anthony Grafton, published earlier this year in Germany, where the research university developed in the 1860's, argues that the footnote lends moral authority to scholarship and may be dispensed with only at the peril of the profession.</p><p>Inspired by an essay by Gertrude Himmelfarb in The New York Times Book Review in 1991, Professor Grafton book ''The Tragic Origins of the German Footnote'' will be published in the United States by Harvard University Press next year. And it seems sure to heat up the present dispute.</p><p>The decline of the footnote, say scholars, editors and university-press managers, has been hastened  by changes in the book publishing industry.</p><p>About six or seven years ago, they say, the cost of subscriptions to academic journals zoomed up, with many costing more than $1,000 a year. As a result the acquisition budgets of libraries throughout the country and around the world were almost completely consumed by journal subscriptions, leaving very little for books by university presses.</p><p>At about the same time, the bookstore chains like Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders began offering the public an unusually broad selection of titles on a wide variety of subjects. The inventories university presses could no longer sell to libraries began showing up -- and selling -- commercially.</p><p>John Kulka, the senior buyer for Barnes &amp; Noble Superstores, said such books represented ''our biggest increase in sales.''</p><p>That development, said John Moore, director of the Columbia University Press, was a ''historic change.''</p><p>''There was a beckoning in the retail book market,'' Mr. Moore said. ''And we followed it.''</p><p>To compete more effectively in this new market, university press editors began packaging their books more attractively, and that meant catchier titles, snappier covers, more and better illustrations and fewer footnotes and bibliographies.</p><p>''A lot of our authors are aiming at the general reader,'' said Jennifer Snodgress, managing director of the Harvard University Press. ''And our marketing department tells us that footnotes scare off people.''</p><p>Colin Day, director of the University of Michigan Press, said editors were also taking part in the effort to streamline texts. While reading submissions, Mr. Day said, he and his fellow editors routinely ask themselves: ''How can we take what this scholar says and make it more powerful and of greater interest to more readers?''</p><p>That process often leads to snipping away all or most of the scholarly apparatus.</p><p>Professor Grafton said that nobody knew who wrote the first footnote, but that the practice took off in the late 17th century when French academicians used it as a weapon to challenge the work of Descartes.</p><p>Descartes had argued in his ''Discourse on Method'' that one gains knowledge of the world by reasoning rather than by the study of the past.</p><p>Among his critics was the philosopher Pierre Bayle, who published an encyclopedia in 1697 all but bursting with footnotes (including footnotes on footnotes) in which he sought to demonstrate that knowledge of the world could be accurate if scholars rigorously revealed their sources in footnotes.</p><p>To do so would allow others to question and improve upon their understanding, exposing mistakes and leading to the truth.</p><p>Bayle's work, although controversial at first, was endorsed by thinkers like Leibniz and the 18th-century Encyclopedists, and within a few years, Professor Grafton said, ''the footnote was at the cutting edge of thought.''</p><p>The Shakespeare of footnotes, many scholars believe, is Edward Gibbon, the 18th-century English historian whose ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' is replete with wry and witty footnotes like one in which Gibbon takes wicked delight in commenting on the fact that the emperor Marcus Aurelius was ''the only man in the empire'' unaware that his wife, Faustina, was unfaithful.</p><p>The acceptance of footnotes reached such a point at the turn of the 20th century that Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the great German classical scholar, pronounced a Swiss treatise on Greek cultural history ''tot fur die Wissen schaft'' or dead for science, because it lacked footnotes.</p><p>But gradually, the style in academe began to change. At first, it became permissible for a senior scholar to dispense with footnotes, although it was considered arrogant for a young instructor to do so.</p><p>In the 1920's and 30's, Carl Sandburg provoked a scholarly storm by publishing his multivolume biography of Lincoln without the usual citations. One outraged critic declared that the cruelest blow ever to befall Lincoln was not being shot by John Wilkes Booth but being chosen as a subject by Sandburg.</p><p>Increasingly, scholars in the post-World War II period have shaken off the chains of citation. Some like F. M. L. Thompson, who published a history of Victorian Britain in 1988, explained in a preface that he had omitted all forms of citation in order to ''sustain the flow of argument and avoid a parade of attribution, exegesis and qualification which some readers might find irritating or superfluous.''</p><p>The longest footnote Professor Grafton said he found appeared in a book called ''The History of Northumberland'' by John Hodgson published in 1840. It ran for 165 pages.</p><p>But such monster footnotes have never been fashionable, and with even the shorter ones being discarded, it may be that when the history of modern scholarship is written the  practice itself will be only a footnote.</p><p>Photo: Professor Anthony Grafton of Princeton University has been involved in the dispute about the demise of footnotes. Recently he discussed a Renaissance manuscript with a graduate student, Tamara Anne Griggs. (J. T. Miller for The New York Times)  </p>                </div>
