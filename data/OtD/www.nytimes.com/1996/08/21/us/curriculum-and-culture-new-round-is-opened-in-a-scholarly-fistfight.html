    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="In 1987, Allan Bloom, then an obscure translator of Plato and Rousseau, touched a raw nerve when he argued in his book ''The Closing of the American Mind'' that the surrender of college and university administrations and faculties to the demands of student, feminist and Black Power movements in the 1960's and 1970's had fatally compromised American higher education.     Writing with zest and hyperbole, the political philosopher compared radical feminism to the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, dismissed the anthropologist Margaret Mead as a ''sexual adventurer,'' likened the Woodstock gathering to Hitler's Nuremberg rallies and denounced ''cultural relativism,'' which treats all cultures as equals.  Professor Bloom called this ''the suicide of science.'' He also argued that efforts to include non-Western cultures in the curriculum were displacing what he regarded as the more valuable teaching of the Western canon.   ">

                    <p>Even before its official publication date on Sept. 3, ''The Opening of the American Mind'' (Beacon Press, $20), by Lawrence W. Levine, a longtime professor of cultural history at the University of California at Berkeley, is being both hailed and denounced with unusual fervor.</p><p>Professor Levine's book is a defense of all that Professor Bloom held unholy. The debate centers on how open or closed society should be to many cultures. The enemy to Professor Bloom was cultural relativism and the lack of restraint that came with it. Professor Levine, on the other hand, champions multiculturalism, which he sees as the inevitable, and praiseworthy, product of constitutional democracy.</p><p>''Multiculturalism,'' Professor Levine said in an interview, ''means that in order to understand the nature and complexities of American culture, it is crucial to study and comprehend the widest possible array of the contributing cultures and their interaction with one another.''</p><p>Among the major points made in his book are these:</p><p>*Conservative critics like Professor Bloom, who blame the fragmentation of American society on the university, do not realize that it has been ''endemic in the United States from the outset.''</p><p>*The college curriculum is not immutable, as Professor Bloom said, but has steadily evolved over the last 200 years.</p><p>*The prospect for the future is ''increasing openness, greater inclusiveness, expanded choice, the study of the modern as well as of the ancient, a concentration on American, African and Asian as well as European culture.''</p><p>Professor Levine is also critical of higher education. He calls for more courses that ''build on one another,'' minimizing jargon, better communication with colleagues in other disciplines and a renewed emphasis on teaching ability.</p><p>Throughout the summer, as the book became available, scholars began to take sides.</p><p>''This is the book we've been waiting for,'' said Stanley N. Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies. ''It should put an end to the 'culture war' talk.''</p><p>Lynne Cheney, who served as chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities under Presidents Reagan and Bush, and who is criticized in the book, disagreed. ''It's the same-old, same-old,'' she said. ''It's the Left deliberately misconstruing the arguments of its opponents while offering no substantive evidence for its own.''</p><p>A MacArthur fellow, Professor Levine is the former president of the Organization of American Historians. After spending 32 years at Berkeley, he joined the faculty of George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., where he now teaches history.</p><p>''What I tried to show in this book,'' he said, ''is that the genius of America has been its ability to renew its essential spirit by admitting a constant infusion of different peoples who demand that the ideals and principles embodied in the Constitution be put into practice.</p><p>''The result has been to open America to great diversity, and colleges and universities are beginning to reflect this heterogeneity. It has not led to repression as Bloom argued, but to the very opposite -- a flowering of ideas and scholarly innovation unmatched in our history.''</p><p>Professor Bloom's book, he said was a reaction to this.</p><p>''He and the people who agreed with him could not accept the expansion of interests, the less parochial world view, and the more comprehensive view of what was important to teach and to learn.''</p><p>Over the years, many authors have written intellectual sequels to Professor Bloom's book -- including William Bennett, Dinesh D'Souza, Roger Kimball and John Searle. And not a few authors also have attacked Professor Bloom -- among them Michael Berube, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Gerald Graff, Francis Oakley, Peter N. Stearns and W. B. Carnochan.</p><p>The battle of the books did not originate with Allan Bloom; it can be traced back at least to 1762 when Rousseau argued in ''Emile'' that it was more important for students to read a commercial novel like ''Robinson Crusoe'' than to read Aristotle.</p>                </div>
