                    <p>WHEN JOHN FROHNMAYER went to Washington to head the National Endowment for the Arts in July 1989, he plunged into the middle of the art wars -- ambushed on the way into town, he says, by Artists Space, a New York gallery that seemed determined to provoke a confrontation. His lively account of this and other adventures appears in "Leaving Town Alive: Confessions of an Arts Warrior," to be published later this month by Houghton Mifflin. Here is a sampling.  "It never occurred to me in my wildest dreams that I could not do this job brilliantly and gracefully. I fully expected to be Washington's darling -- loved, respected and sought out. I was in la-la land."</p><p>"When the time came for my swearing in, I didn't even want to see the President. I had gotten the art world in such an uproar and felt like such a fool that I was sure he was wondering why he had chosen me, and I was too. We all pretended nothing was amiss."  "The West Wing of the White House is a low two-story affair, with the entrance from the empty street on the ground floor and the entrance from Pennsylvania Avenue on the second floor. This confused me, and later, after I was appointed, I was in the Oval Office twice before I realized it was the Oval Office. I couldn't figure out what the President was doing in this other room and why he wasn't using the Oval Office. A bumpkin."  "Congress received more mail in 1990 on the Arts Endowment, which cost each citizen 68 cents for everything we did, than on the savings and loan scandal, which will cost each of us at least $2,000."  "Discussion of esthetics was one of the first casualties of the art wars."  "The only Administration person who saw the value of the arts, as both a social and a political tool, was the king of political kung fu, Lee Atwater."  "The art world was fortunate that it was Jesse Helms instead of someone with more credibility and standing in the Congress making these arguments."  "I saw the arts as a way of embracing all Americans, bringing them together and coaxing them to make their most profound, most sublime efforts for the betterment of all society. It was an unabashedly romantic view, idealistic and, in the eyes of 'sophisticated' Washington, hopelessly naive."  "Those were the days in which I thought I could negotiate anything if people of good will simply got together, discussed the issues and decided on the course that would most benefit the country. Some of my statements to the media reflect that optimism: 'The last thing I want to be is a censor. That's not the job I'm undertaking when I'm chairman of the National Endowment. But there is a continuum here, I think. On one end is absolute freedom and on the other is what I would call the public trust -- when you're using public dollars. We have to be able to find where the balance is on that continuum.'  I didn't know what I was talking about. The continuum, if there is one, runs between absolute freedom at one end and no freedom at the other."  "The White House Mess is more or less under the Oval Office, down a narrow hall and a short flight of stairs. Attended by stewards, it reminded me of being on shipboard, with dark paneling and no windows. The food is good, especially the desserts. One large round table stands near the entrance, and a scattering of smaller tables allow more privacy. The place has a special feel -- it's for important people doing important business. But just to make it clear that this is not a classless society, the Senior White House Mess is separate, on the left of the hall before the stairs."  "It is said that when artists form a firing squad, they stand in a circle. I was ambushed on the way into Washington by the Artists Space show  [ whose confrontational catalogue about AIDS led Mr. Frohnmayer to withdraw a $10,000 grant, which he later restored ] , and I couldn't have handled it worse with a rehearsed script."  "Military bands receive more money from Congress than the entire budget of the Arts Endowment."  "Woozy from the press conference, we drove directly to the PBS studio, where Susan Wyatt, the director of Artists Space, and I were to appear on 'The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour.' As we were made up, Wyatt and I chatted in an amicable way. Twice the producer of the show came in and said, 'No nicey-nicey' -- even this, the most responsible of news programs, wanted the spice."  "During those first few weeks in office, I would get up in the morning and think I was going to throw up. At my desk I received a constant stream of staffers, all strangers to me, each with seemingly worse news. At night I would attend artistic events and try to be charming and intelligent, when all I really wanted was to vanish. One of my law partners told me once that he had never learned anything from a lawsuit that he had won. Surely there were plenty of lessons to be had from my Artists Space experience."  "Why should the idea of a woman rubbing chocolate on her body so inflame the American public? Why wasn't Jesse Helms laughed out of Congress the first time he raised his bespectacled head with this issue?"  "I know now that my focus was wrong. Instead of depending on the process, I was trying to make the necessary esthetic judgments myself. Instead of saving the Endowment by demanding that Congress and the Administration support the arts, warts and all, or giving up and admitting that our society is not strong enough to withstand controversy, I was trying to find middle ground that would appease everyone."  "The one obstacle I could not deal with was the White House. If I had to take the watchers, those who would report directly to the White House rather than to me, and if no one in the White House cared about the Endowment's accomplishing anything other than silence, there was no dream left."  "Monaco's Prince Rainier showed up with his son for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera. The prince set the record for falling asleep in public. Sitting next to Barbara Bush at the beginning of 'La Boheme,' he was snoring gently, his head near her shoulder, in 15 minutes flat. To prove this was no fluke, he bettered his record, 12 minutes, at the start of the second act."  "I admit to sometimes looking across the Old Post Office atrium toward Lynne Cheney's office at the National Endowment for the Humanities with a grudging sense of wonder. I couldn't figure out why the scholarly community was so compliant, so quiescent, as she brought down her heavy hand."  "The rules of honorable engagement in political warfare -- truthful claims, reliance on facts, and a recognition that ultimately, regardless of political affiliation, the common good is our goal -- have vanished."  "The debate over the past four years has been about what some people abhor. It's time for us to think as a nation about what it is we really value."</p><p>Photo: John Frohnmayer, alive and well and still living in Washington.
