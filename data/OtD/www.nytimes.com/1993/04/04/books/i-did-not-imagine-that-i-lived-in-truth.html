This place of shallow roots, quick celebrity and Disneyland colors seems the spiritual opposite of the East Berlin where she lived for 30 years. Plunged into Teutonic shadows for most of her life, Ms. Wolf now finds herself in the fierce southern California light.   She has taken a year's retreat in a stately apartment hotel on the far shore of the New World -- not quite transient, not quite fixed, an alien with an address. The building manager, who didn't know that his tenant, the nice Ms. Wolf, was a writer -- and a prominent former Communist at that -- displayed an autographed photograph of Ronald Reagan on the office wall. The Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities has granted Ms. Wolf the opportunity to begin a new project: a feminist rewriting of the Medea story, designed to defend a maligned woman from Euripides' charge of infanticide.">

                    <p>SANTA MONICA, Calif., is the last place on earth I would have expected to find Christa Wolf, the former East Germany's best-known writer. This place of shallow roots, quick celebrity and Disneyland colors seems the spiritual opposite of the East Berlin where she lived for 30 years. Plunged into Teutonic shadows for most of her life, Ms. Wolf now finds herself in the fierce southern California light.</p><p>She has taken a year's retreat in a stately apartment hotel on the far shore of the New World -- not quite transient, not quite fixed, an alien with an address. The building manager, who didn't know that his tenant, the nice Ms. Wolf, was a writer -- and a prominent former Communist at that -- displayed an autographed photograph of Ronald Reagan on the office wall. The Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities has granted Ms. Wolf the opportunity to begin a new project: a feminist rewriting of the Medea story, designed to defend a maligned woman from Euripides' charge of infanticide.</p><p>But in recent weeks, the person Ms. Wolf finds herself trying to defend is herself. In January, she disclosed that for three years, beginning in 1959, when she was 30 years old, she was an "informal collaborator" for the Stasi, the East German secret police. While she thinks she may have "repressed those details that are the most unpleasant," she is convinced she could not have told the Stasi anything that could have been of use.</p><p>The 64-year-old Ms. Wolf bridles at the notion that her life can be judged by what she calls a selective reading of East German police files. But she knows that there are many who feel angry and betrayed by her, who believe that she has forfeited her claim to moral leadership. Recently, she canceled public appearances at Barnard College and the 92d Street Y in New York, and at Harvard and M.I.T. in Massachusetts, because her doctors thought the stress would not be good for her heart.</p>                </div>

                    <p>When I first interviewed Ms. Wolf last December in Santa Monica she was recovering from an earlier barrage of attacks by critics in the former West Germany. After the Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989, some of the same critics who had once hailed her as a heroine of dissent were now labeling her a "State Poet" -- a pet of the old regime who, however long her leash, had been trotted out to give the Communist dictatorship an aura of respectability. After all, she was one of the East German intellectuals who had campaigned to the last instant, amid the upheaval of November 1989, for an autonomous German Democratic Republic and a "humanistic" socialism purged of Stalinism. Ms. Wolf lost. The grotesque half-nation that she had loved, hoped for, served, criticized, been rewarded by, hated, grown steadily more estranged from and yet refused to flee, had melted away -- and not into the purified socialism she said she had wanted, but rather into a unified Germany hostile to almost everything she had ever believed.</p><p>YET three years later, when she spoke of the great popular movements of 1989 in Germany, her eyes danced. When she recounted how her husband, Gerd Wolf, a literary critic and editor, told her over the phone that the police had not fired upon a huge anti-Government demonstration in Leipzig, she glowed: "I believe that was the happiest moment of my life, when I heard that there was no violence."</p><p>The novella that incited the wrath of many post-wall critics, "What Remains," is the literary work in which she has taken on the Communist regime most bluntly. "We lied and kowtowed and railed and slandered," she writes, "and we lusted for slavery and pleasure." Elsewhere, she remarks, "There is no absolution in sight."</p><p>To her critics, "What Remains" is an exercise in self-exoneration. Ms. Wolf maintains that she wrote the novella, in which a narrator-writer chronicles a day spent under surveillance by the Stasi, essentially in 1979, making only minor changes 10 years later, before publication. Her critics believe that she should have published it earlier, when its appearance would have done the Communist regime real harm. By waiting, they contend, she failed in her moral duty. Some accuse her of tinkering with the original draft in order to pretty herself up as a dissident retroactively, or to claim the status of victim.</p><p>This Ms. Wolf rejected. "I am no victim," she said frequently and indignantly. She also denied that she was trying to bask in a dissident status she had not earned. "I have changed nothing from the original draft," she said, "only revised it in a literary sense." She added: "At that time I wrote several stories that I have not published, among them this one. It was not ripe for publication. And I let it sit."</p><p>"Perhaps it was wrong for me to publish 'What Remains' in 1990," she mused. "When G.D.R. authors visited the West," Ms. Wolf said, "everyone expected from us that every word we wrote had political meaning, and that everything we said was a political statement." She said she "felt misunderstood in this way." She insisted that the attacks against her should be seen in the context of "the successful attempt to demonize East Germany as the evil empire, and at the same time morally to humiliate each person who lived there. Simply the fact that one remained suddenly became a moral deficit."</p>                </div>
