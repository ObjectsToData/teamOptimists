                    <p>KAFKA WAS THE RAGE A Greenwich Village Memoir. By Anatole Broyard. 149 pp. New York: Carol Southern Books/ Crown Publishers. $18.</p><p>ANATOLE BROYARD became familiar to the readers of The New York Times in the 1970's as a book reviewer and personal essayist, but his literary reputation went back to the hip Village scene after World War II, when he gained some renown for a handful of diamond-hard stories and articles in little magazines. "I've read two stories by Anatole Broyard," wrote Norman Mailer, sizing up the competition in "Advertisements for Myself" (1959). "They are each first-rate, and I would buy a novel by him the day it appeared."</p><p>No such work ever came out. Broyard's best-known story, "What the Cystoscope Said," was a harrowing account of his father's death, but his novel on the subject was put aside. The high hopes behind Mr. Mailer's praise may have been the kiss of death for an already blocked writer. Instead, a fluent, self-possessed, often cruel critic took the place of the aspiring novelist, though his prose remained as terse and trenchant as ever. "Kafka Was the Rage," an unfinished but finely honed memoir of downtown New York in 1946-47, was perhaps meant to substitute for the fiction he never wrote and the fiction others wrote about him, like Chandler Brossard's once-famous 1952 novel, "Who Walk in Darkness," which drew an unflattering portrait of him. Broyard was working on "Kafka Was the Rage" in 1989 when he learned he had prostate cancer that had already spread. In his final months -- he died in 1990 -- he turned instead to the witty, courageous essays on death and dying collected last year in "Intoxicated by My Illness." ("I make fun of my illness. I disparage it.")</p><p>The autobiographical impulse is often the last rich vein of a thwarted or fading literary talent. Long-established writers beset by age or illness turn back to the sexual and literary exploits of their bohemian youth for inspiration, excitement or fresh energy, at once reliving the past and enshrining it for posterity. In such books (too often posthumous, like this one), sex mingles with art, passion with ambition, to evoke the dreams of a whole literary generation.</p>                </div>

                    <p>GREENWICH VILLAGE in the 40's is less familiar ground than Paris in the 20's or the Beat scene in the 50's, but Broyard's lens is narrowly focused. Most of the memoir explores his relationship with Sheri Donatti, an abstract artist and protegee of Anais Nin who embodied for him, at 26, the alluring perils of uninhibited sex and unconventional art. Making love to Sheri, he finds, is as mysterious a process as trying to understand her painting or fathom her behavior. Relying on irony, metaphor and paradox, he tries to show how wonderfully alien the experience seemed:</p><p>"Living with Sheri was a process of continual adjustment. It was like living in a foreign city: you learn the language, the currency, the style of the people. . . . You progress from grammar to idioms in an attempt to talk as if you belonged. Still, you never succeed in feeling at home."</p><p>"We were like lovers in a sad futuristic novel where sex is subjected to a revolutionary program."</p><p>"Most people would say that lovemaking is a defense against loneliness, but with Sheri it was an investigation of loneliness, a safari into its furthest reaches."</p><p>In such portentous formulations, the reader may well be struck by the author's remove from actual experience, his ironic detachment from other people and even from his former self. They speak to us not of sexual desire but of a need to reshape the past into perfect sentences, to consummate a love affair with literature after decades of frustrated courtship. Sheri herself, who began as an enigma, remains an enigma, as foreign to him as the day they met.</p><p>BROYARD leaves Sheri after she tries to kill herself by turning on the gas, and her place in the story is taken by Village intellectuals like Milton Klonsky, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight Macdonald and a friend named Saul Silverman, who dies of leukemia. They appeal to his awakening mind much as Sheri attracted his restless libido, but the writer, caught in a habit of ironic superiority, makes them all seem alien and ludicrous. Looking back at the Village four decades after he lived there, he sees everything as foreign: the emigre professors at the New School, who "did their best to make us feel like exiles in our own country"; Meyer Schapiro, lecturing on the mysteries of modern art, who "was so brilliant that he seemed almost insane to me"; and, in his own generation, Delmore Schwartz, so given to "high abstraction" that he seemed "to have read himself right out of American culture."</p><p>An obtuse, nativist view of Village intellectuals was the last thing I expected from these pages. Compared with these luftmenschen, Broyard sees himself as solidly grounded in ordinary life, in the body, in his "intimacy with things": "When I read a book, I always kept one eye on the world, like someone watching the clock." Among these modernist spirits he felt "alienated from alienation, an insider among outsiders." Though envying their brilliance and attracted to their "peculiarities," he sees himself as hip and sexy where they are clumsy and square, stylish where they are merely smart, authentically American where these children of the ghetto "had virtually read and criticized themselves out of any feeling of nationality." The book is shot through with ethnic cliche -- "It was my secret conviction that Delmore and the other writer-intellectuals had very little sense of rhythm" -- and misplaced condescension: "For all their intellectual sophistication, Village writers were suckers. They were awed by action and passion. They saw western movies as myths."</p><p>There is an odd mix of nostalgia and disdain in Broyard's portrait of the Village scene. Trapped in the ironic mode, perhaps soured by the collapse of his larger literary ambitions, Broyard lands on the far shore of misogyny (with Sheri) and, at best, of anti-intellectualism (with the Village writers). Broyard's family had moved from New Orleans to Brooklyn when he was 6; it was he who felt like a stranger: "We had always been outsiders in New York. At Brooklyn College, everyone had been a Communist but me."</p><p>At school his Jewish classmates had repelled him: "I assumed in my mechanistic 8-year-old way that their trouble in speaking had something to do with the structure of their noses. . . . Their speech got as far as their noses, like a head cold, and stopped there.</p><p>"Though I was a good student, I knew I could never be as smart as those Jewish boys who were strangled by their smartness. . . . I saw them as Martians, creatures from a more advanced planet. . . . They were at home in the city in a way that I wasn't. . . .</p><p>"You can't say such things now without being called anti-Semitic."</p><p>The real issue is not misogyny or anti-Semitism. These were love-hate relationships; Broyard was drawn to the Village for just those sexual and intellectual "peculiarities" that also repelled him, as we can see in the stark chapter on Saul Silverman. This mixture of distaste and amusement can be a good source of comedy, as when Broyard accompanies Delmore Schwartz to buy a suit at Brooks Brothers. ("Nobody ever looked less dressed in a suit," Broyard writes. "He could even turn buying a suit into a tragedy.")</p><p>Nearly everyone in this book comes off as a grotesque, a monster of eccentricity, a type. The issue is finally a failure of human sympathy, a narcissistic self-absorption that gave Broyard style, bravado, even gaiety during his final illness but doomed his hope of being a novelist. It turns "Kafka Was the Rage," for all the chiseled brilliance of its prose, into a monologue about the past, a rumination in which all but one of its characters, along with the Village itself, remain muffled, remote, indistinct presences.</p>                </div>
