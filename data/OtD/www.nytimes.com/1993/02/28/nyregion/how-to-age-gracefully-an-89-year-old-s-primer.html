On Thursday and Friday there is prayer group at the Congregational Church, where she also has the task of sending sympathy and get-well cards to parishioners when appropriate and congratulations for new babies.</p><p>On Wednesdays she plays the piano for services at the convalescent home where her husband was a patient, and on Thursday afternoons she teaches a macrame class at the library. Her garden club meets once a month.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Family affairs also take up a good chunk of her time -- she has three children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren -- as do the lectures she gives five times a month on average. The subjects include the history of Middebury and, the most popular of all, the Leatherman, a mysterious Frenchman, Jules Bourglay, who from 1858 to 1889 walked a 365-mile circuit from the Connecticut River to the Hudson River, showing up like clockwork every 34 days. He was delayed only once, by the great blizzard of 1888.</p><p>"Sarah is a specialist in so many things," said Ruth Upson, a director of the Middlebury Historical Society "Her enthusiasm for life is unending."</p><p>Mrs. Upson's own association with the Foote family goes back a long way, since her mother taught Roy Foote in the one-room schoolhouse that has been converted to a residence across the street from Mrs. Foote's home. Indeed, almost everything in Middlebury has a personal association for Mrs. Foote, who grew up in New Milford and retired at 75 after a 27-year nursing career at the Taft School in Watertown.</p><p>As she tools around town in her 1987 Dodge Omni, she points out the Historical Society, where her son Wayne attended kindergarten; the Senior Center, formerly the school all her children attended, and the Public Library, for which her husband helped raised building funds. She particularly likes to draw attention to the Middlebury Land Trust, to which she gave 37 of her 75 acres "so there will be open space."</p><p>Scouts love the Leatherman program, she said, because it relates to camping and hiking. And fifth-graders at the Bunker Hill School in Waterbury were so taken by a recent presentation they sent her 30 letters of appreciation and invited her back.</p><p>Tramps were a part of the country scene in the 1800's, but the Leatherman was different from the rest. He seldom spoke, his clothing was made entirely of leather and, although he relied on handouts of food along the way, he never ate indoors and never accepted a bed for the night, preferring to sleep in caves and other shelters he had discovered along his route.</p><p>Then, too, his life story was sad and romantic. Mrs. Foote tells how, as a young man, this native of Lyons, France, fell in love with the daughter of a rich leather merchant, who agreed to their marriage provided he made a success of the leather trade. Alas, he failed. The marriage was called off and the heartbroken man was institutionalized with a nervous breakdown.</p><p>The first documented sighting of the Leatherman was in Harwinton.  "He was a devout Catholic and was doing a self-imposed penance," Mrs. Foote said.</p><p>Mrs. Foote and her husband, a former vice president of the Waterbury Savings Bank who died in 1987, spent years researching the Leatherman, poring over newspaper articles and photographs, interviewing more than 400 people who remembered him, and with their children searching out his shelters. "We feel like he's part of the family," Mrs. Foote said.</p><p>The Leatherman was found dead in his shelter at Pleasantville, N.Y., on March 24, 1889, and was buried in a pauper's grave at the Sparta Cemetary in nearby Ossining. The Footes were among those on hand in 1953 for the ceremony that placed a marker on the grave.</p><p>Mrs. Foote starts her program with a 25-minute video produced by the Connecticut Humanities Society, which, naturally enough, includes interviews with her and her husband. This is followed by 25-minute slide show that concentrates on the caves the Leatherman used, many of them still accessible today. She always takes along a leather suit and has someone impersonate the subject.</p><p>Mrs. Foote is preparing a new lecture, "Turkish Adventure," about the two-week tour of historic sites she took last year and her experiences as a missionary nurse at the American Hospital in Adana in southern Turkey from 1926 to 1929. "Ankara was a just a little village when I was there," she recalled.</p><p>Although English is widely spoken in Turkey today, the Turkish she learned long ago enabled Mrs. Foote to communicate easily with the children she met along the way and with waiters. "Boy, did I get good service," she said.</p><p>Mrs. Foote will be 90 in July. She has told her family that to celebrate she would like to go up in a hot air balloon.</p><p>Photo: Sarah Foote, 89 years old, appearing at a dinner in November at the Radisson Hotel in Englewood, N.J.
