My dad said, 'You want to be in a play?' I didn't know what a play was. I didn't even see movies. It was cartoons and 'Romper Room' for me.&quot;   Her father took her to the audition. &quot;I lied about my age,&quot; she says. &quot;I said I was 7. They asked me to say some words backward -- 'What's &quot;car&quot; backward?' 'Rack?' Gee, what a genius!' I got the part. We did the play in Greek. I still know my lines. But I was completely disconnected to    performance    as a word. And    career    was a lifetime away as a thought.&quot;">

"I lied about my age," she says. "I said I was 7. They asked me to say some words backward -- 'What's "car" backward?' 'Rack?' Gee, what a genius!' I got the part. We did the play in Greek. I still know my lines. But I was completely disconnected to    performance    as a word. And    career    was a lifetime away as a thought.""></div>

And    career    was a lifetime away as a thought."</p><p>If it's true that in dreams begin responsibility, then it's also true that in deeds begin careers.</p><p>At 7, as a full-fledged member of the La Mama Repertory Troupe in New York, Diane Lane performed Greek tragedies among the ruins in Lebanon. When she was 12, George Roy Hill spotted her in a play at the Public Theater and cast her in the film "A Little Romance," in which she played an innocent American girl who ran away with the help of a gentleman pickpocket played by Laurence Olivier. At 14, her wholesome face graced the cover of Time magazine, which named her one of "Hollywood's Whiz Kids." She managed the leap from child actor to young woman actor, appearing in three films directed by Francis Ford Coppola. But after a dismal response to his 1984 film "Cotton Club" she took two years off, and it wasn't until she appeared in the 1989 mini-series "Lonesome Dove," as a young prostitute, that her career started to take off again.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Today, at 28, Ms. Lane is the veteran of 21 films -- most recently the deadpan comedy "My New Gun," "Chaplin" and "Knight Moves." Yet the reservation book where she's lunching in Beverly Hills lists her as Diane Ladd. When she gives her name, Ladd is crossed out and changed to Lain.</p><p>Ms. Lane admits she is often mistaken for the other actress. But there's something else that bothers her. "When you've been around as long as I have, people say, 'Aren't you 35 yet?' "</p><p>Wearing her hair pulled up and very little makeup, Ms. Lane still looks young. When she smiles, you see exuberance rather than a sulky exotic. Says Stacy Cochran, the director of "My New Gun": "Diane's got the kind of line-drawn beauty that you see in an illustration of a fable. Yet she's completely alert to the moment. She's not a lost soul from another century."</p><p>In "My New Gun," which Janet Maslin described in The Times as "a delectably wry slice of suburban life," Ms. Lane was deemed "enormously appealing" in the starring role of a bewildered housewife.</p><p>According to Ms. Lane, "I liked the challenge that the movie rested on my shoulders, and that it wasn't the typical female-optional role." In "Knight Moves," she plays a psychologist who helps police track down a serial killer by working with the chief suspect, a chess master.</p><p>Ms. Lane says she does not recall ever feeling compelled to act. Instead, she says that her parents, who divorced when she was a few weeks old, used the theater as a form of child care. "You can get into trouble on the streets of New York," she says. "So I'd go right from school to the La Mama workshop. We'd do exercises where we'd pretend to be animals. And then we toured the world with these plays. I went to Iran twice, Holland, Italy -- no parents. I was the responsibility of the theater company."</p><p>Ellen Stewart, the director and founder of La Mama, does not think the nomadic theater life harmed Ms. Lane. "She was a child in an adult world, but she remained a child. We rode in trains, planes and ferries; we were in wagons with horses and hay. If every child could have that, it would be much better."</p><p>During the school year, Ms. Lane lived with her father, Burt Lane, in a residential hotel -- "that's where they don't have room service, but they change your sheets once a week. Then I'd flit off, abandon ship and go live with my mom."</p><p>Acting, while perhaps not a calling, may have been in Ms. Lane's blood. Her father was a drama coach who had turned to cabdriving (he's now a teacher of humanities for the Center for Worker Education at the City University of New York). "Before I was born, he wrote a screenplay," Ms. Lane says. "It got two stars in TV Guide."</p><p>Ms. Lane's mother, Colleen Price, moved from Georgia to New York City to become an actress and singer. "She was the October 1957 Playmate centerfold," Ms. Lane volunteers. "She was a good mother as far as the emotional part. But her world wasn't organized, and it became obvious that wisdom wasn't the prevailing M.O. My mom did some business dealings on my behalf that were not intentionally maligning, but just not wise. I was allowed to indulge in things that 15-year-olds aren't usually allowed -- the money, the traveling, the parties. We were buying furs, we were buying houses, and it was gone before you knew it."</p><p>Ms. Price answers that the houses were sold "at a bad time," and she admits she urged her daughter to buy fur. Ms. Lane had a fox fur, she says, but lost the down payment on another coat. It was "a dark ranch mink she could have worn over jeans," her mother remembers. "Maybe I was influencing her too much on the color and the style."</p>                </div>
