    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  At a lecture in New York last fall, the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas began by wondering aloud why his generation has taken so long to make its mark upon the city. Koolhaas, 47, is part of the postwar European generation that came of age with the &quot;events of May,&quot; the student upheavals that rocked Paris and other cities in 1968. For Koolhaas, '68 remains a touchstone, not for sentimental reasons, or not mainly, but because the protests revealed attitudes that, for better or worse, remain in force.   To paraphrase his musings: if architects of this generation feel &quot;marginalized,&quot; that is because they chose to occupy the margins, because they staked their identity to a stance of opposition they have yet to outgrow. No one is stopping them from crossing over their self-imposed barricades, nor is the city still the stern father's stone face.">

                    <p>At a lecture in New York last fall, the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas began by wondering aloud why his generation has taken so long to make its mark upon the city. Koolhaas, 47, is part of the postwar European generation that came of age with the "events of May," the student upheavals that rocked Paris and other cities in 1968. For Koolhaas, '68 remains a touchstone, not for sentimental reasons, or not mainly, but because the protests revealed attitudes that, for better or worse, remain in force.</p><p>To paraphrase his musings: if architects of this generation feel "marginalized," that is because they chose to occupy the margins, because they staked their identity to a stance of opposition they have yet to outgrow. No one is stopping them from crossing over their self-imposed barricades, nor is the city still the stern father's stone face.</p><p>Koolhaas had a point, but does it apply to him? Unlike many of his contemporaries, he has never shrunk back from the urban center, as the name of his firm -- Office of Metropolitan Architecture, or O.M.A. -- suggests.  Yet that firm retains a countercultural spirit. Based in Rotterdam, O.M.A. is, in effect, an office of city planning without a city to plan, the self-appointed bureaucracy of some imaginary city that has replaced its bureaucrats with dreamers. Images of New York and Atlanta float through Koolhaas's built and theoretical projects like wish fulfillments for a new world. But the work remains philosophically attuned to Paris and to the role students have traditionally played throughout the city's cultural history.</p><p>Now it looks as if Koolhaas will get to add a chapter to that history. In December, he won a competition to design a new library building for the Jussieu Campus of the Sorbonne, a pivotal site in the May uprising a quarter century ago. For this architect, it is a dream of a job, a chance to explore his generation's social mythology at its historic root. And Koolhaas's design is dream architecture: a building where space flows out of confining compartments into a high-rise full of free associations.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The location is at once a dream and a nightmare. The Jussieu Campus is on the Left Bank, where the Boulevard St.-Germain meets the Seine, not far from Notre Dame. But the campus itself is infernal. Designed in the early 1960's by Edouard Albert, it is mostly housed in one immense building, a square metal labyrinth that seems to go on forever. Within the steel walls, modular units are laid out like a checkerboard, each module enclosing an abyss of a courtyard. Outside, a strip of emptiness tries to pass for public space. Only the faceless figures that populate architectural renderings would feel at home here.</p><p>The building was unfinished at the time of the 1968 riots, when construction was suspended. The Government hoped to ward off future unrest by shifting resources -- and thereby students -- from Parisian schools to suburban campuses. That left Albert's building with a ragged, saw-toothed corner, which is where the new building will rise. Containing two separate libraries and facilities for student recreation, the project will mark the campus's symbolic completion.</p><p>Koolhaas's "completion" is also an inversion: transparent, vertical and fluid where Albert is opaque, horizontal and stiff. Seven concrete floor slabs, with 23 feet between them, define the main levels of a square, glass-clad tower. Instead of stacking up the floors in the usual horizontal layers, Koolhaas has made large, irregular cuts in each slab, removing a third of their floor area. Wide ramps, inserted into the cuts, slope at different angles and meet at intermediary levels between the floors. The result is the most spectacular use of the spiral form since Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum.</p><p>Entering the building at the third-floor level (through connectors to Albert's building), students can descend to a library of scientific books or mount the ramps to one devoted to the humanities. But this wide-open space will encourage a porous relationship between its components. Reading rooms, stacks, classrooms, offices and audio-visual centers will occupy both sloping and level floors. Some slopes will form natural amphitheaters; others will be landscaped, like indoor parks. Cafes and sports areas will supplement a scheme conceived to resemble the mix of an urban street. In effect, Koolhaas has scooped up the barren public space outside Albert's building, folded it this way and that to create a continuous vertical landscape, built up the landscape to keep it constantly active, and wrapped the whole thing up in a transparent skin. University life will become visibly part of the city.</p><p>While the warping of the floor planes may seem idiosyncratic, it is not without precedent in 20th-century architecture. Those slopes will be familiar terrain to anybody who has climbed the steps of the Metropolitan Opera House or has seen pictures of the Helicline at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Wallace K. Harrison, who designed these monuments, has been a major influence on Koolhaas, and so has Mies van der Rohe. His somewhat quixotic goal has been to forge a synthesis between these two irreconcilable figures. It is Mies that we see reflected in the library's unadorned skin of glass, in the regular rhythm of its exposed concrete columns. An interplay between the disciplined and the polymorphous is the library's underlying formal idea.</p><p>While it may seem logical to identify the structural system with science, the free-form floors with the humanities, in fact Koolhaas designs against that logic. Like the philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard, he wants to pierce the wall between these disciplines. For Bachelard, a Sorbonne professor whose influence on architecture has grown since his death in 1962, the poet and the scientist were creative beings allied against the excessive claims of reason. For Koolhaas, structure may be essential to architecture but need not dictate its form. Here, the structural grid supports an experiment to show that form can depart from regularity yet deepen its obligation to function.</p><p>As such, the design converts to constructive form the explosive forces that erupted here 25 years ago. As James Miller observes in his biography of Michel Foucault, the student protest was more potent for being apparently aimless. It was focused beyond concrete political demands toward "the very order of things in the modern world generally."</p><p>Regularized, homogenized, rigid -- that order remains on permanent display in Albert's building, though Koolhaas is mature enough to recognize the idealism it once represented. Paired with it, his building will be at once a gesture of reconciliation and a permanent act of rupture. Functionally flexible, formally indeterminate, the library is designed to show that architecture can do more than contain the mind's adventures. It can also lead minds out of containment by embarking on adventures of its own. Naturally, the students who use this building may find Koolhaas's dizzying adventure as intolerable as he found Albert's.</p><p>Photos: Rem Koolhaas's prize-winning design, above (Computer image by Jerry Kopare/Office for Metropolitan Architecture), and in model form, left, for a new Sorbonne library (GaryBates/Office for Metropolitan Architecture) -- The most spectacular use of the spiral form since Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim.</p>                </div>
