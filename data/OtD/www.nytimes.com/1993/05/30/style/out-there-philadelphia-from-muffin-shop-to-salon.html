                    <p>Hard-core Philadelphia foodies might disagree, but some of the best fare served up at the White Dog Cafe is talk.</p><p>Last Monday evening, for instance, Dr. Thomas Naff, a professor of modern Middle Eastern studies at the University of Pennsylvania, strolled the few blocks from his campus office to the restaurant and ate a dinner of grilled tuna with tomato and black-olive vinaigrette, accompanied by crisp anise-flavored polenta fries. He then rose to offer his theories about the Middle East peace talks, particularly the role that hydropolitics play in the complicated process.</p><p>Nearly four dozen people, who paid $25 each, filled a dining room reserved for the occasion. Among the group were lawyers from Philadelphia firms, a member of the city's World Affairs Council and several graduate students. They chose from among the tuna, oven-roasted chicken breasts glazed with rosemary and sage, and vegetable ratatouille with linguine, herbed ricotta and Parmesan cheese. And they listened.</p><p>Speaking loudly over the noise of a busy evening in the rest of the cafe, Dr. Naff said he was only half-heartedly optimistic about the peace talks because "access to water is a zero-sum, power- and prestige-packed issue that is extremely difficult to resolve."</p>                </div>

                    <p>Although this was Dr. Naff's first lecture at the White Dog Cafe, it was not his first meal. "I come here quite a bit," he said. "It's an interesting place, very uniquely Judy."</p><p>Judy is Judy Wicks, 46, a former Vista volunteer and waitress who has become a successful restaurant proprietor through an unusual combination of qualities: a sharp business sense, a liberal outlook (she readily calls herself a "lefty") and a wacky feel for the festive. All of this has led to events like an annual New Year's Day brunch, when patrons are encouraged to dress in their pajamas.</p><p>Since it opened as a muffin shop 10 years ago, the White Dog Cafe has become not only one of this city's most consistently popular and well-reviewed restaurants, but also Ms. Wicks's Chautauqua.</p><p>Over the years, the muffin shop was transformed into the White Dog Cafe as Ms. Wicks expanded the menu. She began the informal lecture series five years ago when she suspected that diners might be interested in thinking as well as eating. This year alone there will be two dozen speeches. Diners have already heard the author Mark Lane discuss his conspiracy theories about the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Sheldon Hackney, Penn's president and President Clinton's choice to run the National Endowment for the Humanities, showed up another night for dinner and talked about the role of universities in American cities. Earlier this month, Dr. Patch Adams, a doctor who founded the Gesundheit Institute in West Virginia, a medical practice that provides free care, spoke about humor and humanism in medicine. And in June, another Penn professor, Dr. Houston Baker, will discuss racial diversity and freedom of speech.</p><p>"I want this to be a cool place to hang out," Ms. Wicks said recently. "This is a business, and a successful business. But that wouldn't be enough for me. It's a neighborhood place, really. We could be someone's home."</p><p>It once was. The White Dog, at 3420 Sansom Street, got its name from an incident in the life of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian noblewoman and theosophist who lived in the building in the late 1800's. According to legend, Madame Blavatsky once cured her infected leg by having her white dog lay on it.</p><p>Ms. Wicks lives above the cafe, which occupies two connected row houses, built in 1871, on the eastern edge of the University of Pennsylvania campus. She and her husband won the right to purchase the buildings in 1983 after a 15-year legal battle with the university over its plans to raze the entire block. Ms. Wicks now shares an apartment filled with antiques with her two children, a white poodle named Emily that frequently pads through the restaurant and a black cat named Shiva that is the official mascot for the Black Cat, Ms. Wicks's equally eccentric antiques and gift shop adjacent to the cafe.</p><p>With Madame Blavatsky long gone, Ms. Wicks has preserved her spirit in the restaurant's decor, which is filled with dog figurines and canine art. Even the restrooms have dog murals on the walls.</p><p>Ms. Wicks admits to a limited sophistication about food, so she leaves it in the hands of Kevin von Klause, 36, who worked at a Philadelphia restaurant called Apropos. Since he took over in 1986, the White Dog, "leads the pack of local restaurants doing new-style American cooking," a restaurant reviewer for Philadelphia magazine wrote.</p><p>In January, Mimi Sheraton, thefood editor for Conde Nast Traveler magazine, named the White Dog Cafe as one of 50 American restaurants worth a journey. Ms. Wicks said that she recently fed New Yorkers who had hired limousines to visit the White Dog.</p><p>Ms. Wicks has made a few journeys of her own. She was in New York last Monday night to attend a meeting of the Social Venture Network, a group of business people, to discuss plans for a 10-day trip to Cuba with 18 of her restaurant patrons. (They left last Thursday.) It is the latest chapter in what she calls her "sister restaurant project," in which she, Mr. von Klause and others visit restaurants in countries that are diplomatically distant from the United States. Ms. Wicks and some of her devoted diners have also been to Nicaragua, El Salvador, Vietnam and Lithuania.</p><p>"It's person-to-person diplomacy," she said. "We call it 'eating with the enemy.' "</p><p>Ms. Wicks will be back from Cuba in time for the next dinner lecture, on ecotourism, scheduled for June 27, and for the White Dog's annual Fourth of July block party, which spills out of the restaurant and onto Sansom Street. At some point during the party, as she has done for years, Ms. Wicks will bring her bed down from upstairs, put a beach ball under a Colonial-era dress, and then act in a skit in which she gives "birth" to Liberty and Justice -- actually, tap-dancers who perform "Yankee Doodle Dandy."</p><p>It is, like her restaurant, very Judy.</p><p>Photo: A choice of tuna, chicken or ratatouille is served with a lecture by Dr. Thomas Naff.
