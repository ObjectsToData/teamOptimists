                    <p>MONTICELLO, the Roman temple Thomas Jefferson built over 40 years on a frontier mountaintop near Charlottesville, Va., looks more like it did when he lived there than it has at any time since his death on July 4, 1826.</p><p>The mansion's interiors were painted, plastered and redecorated for "The Worlds of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello," an exhibition marking the 250th anniversary of the third President's birth on April 13, 1743. For the occasion, Monticello's leaky roof was restored to approximate one Jefferson had designed and to shelter, temporarily, 150 of his treasures lent to the show. Financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities, it remains through December.</p><p>The most important relic to come home again is Jefferson's lap desk, on which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. Made to his specifications by Benjamin Randolph, a Philadelphia cabinet maker, the mahogany artifact is admirably plain, a box with a hinged fold-down writing surface on top and a drawer for pens and paper below. The desk, lent by the Smithsonian Institution, is exhibited in the tea room with Jefferson's revolving comb-back Windsor, the Philadelphia chair on which he sat while he penned the Declaration.</p><p>"The writing arm on that Windsor was added later, probably at Monticello," said Susan R. Stein, Monticello's curator. Ms. Stein, who organized the show over six years, wrote the catalogue published by Harry N. Abrams and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation ($65 in cloth, $39.95 in paper).</p>                </div>

                    <p>Sparsely furnished for decades, more formal than friendly and coolly elegant throughout, the house Jefferson designed and built between 1769 and 1809 seems once again more like the home where he lived with two of his daughters -- Mary, who died in 1804, and Martha, who survived Jefferson -- and 12 of his grandchildren. The house overlooking Jefferson's 5,000 acres -- reduced today to 2,000 acres -- was a busy place, maintained by 10 or 12 of Jefferson's 200 slaves. Those working in the house and workshops lived 50 yards away, while farmhands on the plantation were housed elsewhere.</p><p>The 10 rooms visitors see on the guided tours of the main floor are part of the 1790's expansion of the domed dwelling, the nation's oldest such structure. Enriched now by many of Jefferson's prized possessions, all auctioned after his death to pay his debts, the interiors are laced with memorabilia, paintings and furnishings. Silhouettes of his friends and family, yesteryear's snapshots, cover a wall in a sitting room where there are also two rare mementoes, a small metal bell used to call the servants and a sewing kit that once belonged to Jefferson's wife, Martha. Mrs. Jefferson, who had been married for a decade, died in 1782.</p><p>Most of the objects on loan are displayed among the permanent furnishings in Jefferson's private quarters, a soaring two-story area that includes a library, an office called the cabinet, a bedroom, a sitting room and a greenhouse. Lined with tall French windows and glass doors, the rooms are flooded with light on sunny days and are bright even when it's cloudy, which is why there is no artificial lighting on Monticello's main floor.</p><p>"It's substantially more cluttered but probably not cluttered enough," Ms. Stein said. "The library where we now have 1,900 books is where he had nearly 7,000."</p><p>Jefferson's leather-bound volumes are displayed in reproductions of the bookcases he had made at Monticello, sparely designed cabinets that functioned as packing crates for his books when he traveled.</p><p>"He read in seven languages," Ms. Stein said. "He once wrote John Adams 'I cannot live without books.' "</p><p>But when the Library of Congress suffered a serious fire in 1814 and Jefferson needed money, he offered Congress the opportunity to buy his books, then the finest private library in the country. The 7,000 volumes, for which he was paid $23,950, were shipped to Washington in their cases, becoming the nucleus of the new Library of Congress. Jefferson continued to buy books and amassed the library now in the house.</p><p>Today, the revolving top of Jefferson's work table in his quarters displays his spectacles, an inkwell in the form of the head of Voltaire, whose writings he admired, and a dumbbell he used to exercise his right wrist, which he injured in Paris in the late 1780's while serving there as United States Minister. Near his alcove bed are his drawing tools, compass, telescope and microscope. His scruffy boots stand near a traveling trunk for spirits and reproductions of his silver-embroidered great coat, cotton leggings and a cap lined with bobcat fur.</p><p>Pointing to a tall-case clock topped by a scrolled impediment, Ms. Stein said, "When he missed an eclipse in 1811, he ordered this astronomical clock." It was returned from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania for the exhibition and moved to the spot by his bed where Jefferson originally placed it. He had ordered it without a striking mechanism because the black marble and brass obelisk clock over his bed, which he designed and had made in Paris, chimed every 30 minutes.</p>                </div>
