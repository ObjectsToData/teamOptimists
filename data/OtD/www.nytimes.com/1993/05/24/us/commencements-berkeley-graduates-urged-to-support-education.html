                    <p>After a steel-band version of "Pomp and Circumstance," the California State Treasurer, Kathleen Brown, urged graduating law students on Saturday to "remember who you represent and be as generous to this state as it has been to you."</p><p>Elected in 1990, Ms. Brown is the daughter of one former California Governor and the sister of another. She has been the state's chief financial officer during what has been called the state's worst economic times since the Depression and is considered a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 1994.</p><p>"Today there are those who see the challenges of the state as insurmountable, who see the California state of mind as befuddled," Ms. Brown said. The state's social, economic and environmental problems "hardly justify a mind-set that says drop out or cut and run," she said.</p><p>In her commencement address, Ms. Brown said the state's financial problems were destroying California's public education system. The University of California's nine campuses face budget reductions for a fourth year in a row and officials are considering suspending several months of instruction next year to save money. Last month, the chancellor of Berkeley's campus threatened to resign over budget decisions.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"You should be the first to say, 'No, we are not going to sacrifice education to the short-term budget imperatives,' " Ms. Brown said. "The future of California is dependent on education. California is education, whether it be this university or an elementary school on the edge of some dusty town. What has been done to them is a travesty. Each of you has the power to make the personal commitment to support education with your time, your energy and with your money."</p><p>Ms. Brown spoke to 335 students of the 1993 class of Boalt Hall School of Law, in one of more than 50 ceremonies in Berkeley during the university's 125th commencement. A total of 8,000 degrees, including 5,400 bachelor's degrees, were conferred.</p><p>Ms. Brown, who graduated from Fordham University School of Law in 1985, told the hundreds of future lawyers that they "must enter the fray, be a player."</p><p>"Advancing a career in no way precludes advancing the world in which you live," she said.</p><p>The theme of remembering one's origins was echoed in another part of the campus at a special graduation ceremony for 215 Hispanic graduating students from all departments. The celebration was half in Spanish, half in English, and included dancers in Aztec costumes. Hanging across the stage, a white banner with red letters read, "Viva Cesar Chavez."</p><p>Recalling the contributions of Mr. Chavez, Carla Trujillo, master of ceremonies and a lecturer in the ethnic studies department, said the late union organizer would have been proud of the man who picked lettuce for 15 years and then received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Berkeley during the weekend.</p><p>"This is the kind of person the media should focus on instead of an Americano running around without his clothes on," said Ms. Trujillo, referring to a campus controversy overpublic nudity.</p><p>A student speaker, Selena Ortiz, a graduating sociology major, said that in her years at Berkeley the changing political atmosphere had meant that the term she used to refer to herself had gone from Hispanic to Mexicana to Latina, each making a different statement about identity.</p><p>"Regardless of what we call ourselves, fee increases have forced us to drop out of college and accept our dreams deferred," she said.</p><p>Other speakers at Berkeley's commencement were Mick Fleetwood of the rock group Fleetwood Mac, who spoke to graduates at the College of Letters and Science; the author Jessica Mitford, who spoke to mass communication graduates, and the Berkeley environmentalist David Brower, who spoke to environmental science graduates.  University of Virginia</p><p>About 20,000 family members and friends of the University of Virginia's class of 1993 gathered on the Charlottesville campus yesterday for the school's 164th commencement.</p><p>About 4,200 degrees were conferred at the main ceremony by the university's president, John T. Casteen 3d.</p><p>Afterward, several colleges held their own ceremonies. Julian Bond, the civil rights leader and a member of the history faculty, addressed graduates of the School of Law.</p><p>On Saturday, Tom Brokaw, the NBC News anchor, delivered the class valediction address. Brandeis University</p><p>Liv Ullmann, actress and good-will ambassador for Unicef, delivered the keynote address to the 933 graduates at Brandeis University's 42d commencement yesterday in Waltham, Mass.</p><p>Ms. Ullmann told the graduates that they were in charge of helping society understand the "new world order" and the horrors behind labels like "ethnic cleansing."</p><p>"You have inherited a world that desperately needs your leadership," she said. "You must trust and love."</p><p>Ms. Ullmann received an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Brandeis awarded 703 bachelor's degrees, 144 master's degrees and 86 Ph.D. degrees. Mount Holyoke College</p><p>Judith Kurland, Commissioner of Health and Hospitals in Massachusetts and a Mount Holyoke alumna, delivered the main address to the 500 graduates yesterday at the 156th commencement of Mount Holyoke College, in South Hadley, Mass.</p><p>Ms. Kurland told the graduates to stand up for their opinions, to be strong women who "seek the public good, not the public applause."</p><p>Commissioner Kurland received an honorary doctorate of humane letters. Theodore R. Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.</p><p>Mount Holyoke, a women's college, awarded 496 Bachelor of Arts degrees and 4 master's degrees.

Lamb, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of C-Span, the cable-satellite public affairs network.</p><p>Amherst College</p><p>Amherst College conferred 403 undergraduate degrees yesterday at the college's 172d commencement exercises on the Frost Library steps on the campus in Amherst, Mass.</p><p>On Saturday, Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, gave the keynote address to the 403 undergraduates on what is traditionally called Senior Class Day Exercises.</p><p>Mrs. Ogata spoke on the issue of refugees and was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws.</p><p>The college awarded seven other honorary degrees.

Whitehead, chairman of the Brookings Institution; John Fox Wieland, head of a large building company in the Southeast, and Thomas H. Wyman, former chairman of CBS.
