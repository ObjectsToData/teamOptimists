ROBLES is founder and president of the Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities, which opened its headquarters in a building owned by Quinnipiac College in Hamden earlier this year.</p><p>Dr. Schweitzer (1875-1965) was an Alsatian medical missionary, theologian, musician and philosopher. He resigned a college position in 1913 to go to a mission in what was then French Equatorial Africa, where he built a hospital to serve the native population. His personal philosophy was summed up in three words: "Reverence for Life."</p><p>Mr. Robles, who is a native of the Netherlands, founded the institute in 1984 with the support of Rhena Schweitzer Miller, the doctor's daughter. He was director of the Connecticut Red Cross before he became full-time director of the institute last year. Mr. Robles has compiled a book of Schweitzer's quotes, "Reverence for Life: The Words of Albert Schweitzer," which will be published this year, and written another book, "Albert Schweitzer, His Life and Legacy," to be released next winter. Mr. Robles was interviewed recently in Hamden. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.</p><p>Q. How did you get so involved in the ideals of Schweitzer?</p>                </div>

                    <p>A. I met the man in his books when I was growing up in Holland. I read them from the time I was very young. Then he gave an organ concert when I was 8 years old, and I was invited to come and meet him before the concert. I got wild about the man. I started an Albert Schweitzer fan club, like you had Elvis Presley fan clubs and Doris Day fan clubs. We did some big things. We did car washes and bake sales and sent the money to Schweitzer in Africa. I developed a very good relationship with one of his nurses, Maria Lagendijk, and she had him sign things for me, and send things to me from Africa. She became like my second mother.</p><p>Q. What about him fascinated you?</p><p>A. That somebody can give up their life, their career, and all ambition, and say "I don't want this. I want to dedicate my life to people who don't have it the way I have it." Even today, when I talk about the man, I get goosebumps. Here is a man who could have made a tremendous career, but gave it all up and went to Africa to serve humanity. He was a minister, with a doctorate in geology and philosophy and medicine, and he went to do it with his own hands. That, to me, is just a miracle.</p><p>Q. Are there any people like him today?</p><p>A. No, unfortunately. People like to be stroked today, they love to have money, they love material things. Why would they give it up? People are not as compassionate today as they were years ago. However, you have people like Jane Goodall and the Dalai Lama who devote their lives to certain things but who also like to have some luxury in their life. Schweitzer was a man who really suffered, who built his hospital with his own hands. We don't have people like that anymore.</p><p>But there are many young people today who become aware of Schweitzer and who become immediately willing to serve, who are willing to pick it up and do something. The requests I receive in the mail from young people who want to work at the institute, or volunteer somewhere for the institute, are phenomenal.</p><p>We have an environmental program. Every time we open the door, the kids are coming from the poorest part of New York, whose parents are in prison for selling drugs or they have been killed in front of their eyes.</p><p>Q. How did the institute end up in Hamden?</p><p>A. I had been looking for a long time, since I started the institute, to house the organization for the future. What if something happens to me? I have a major collection of Schweitzer memorabilia, thousands of original letters to people like Einstein, Kennedy, and Adlai Stevenson. I have hundreds of books written by him or about him, photographs, and so on. I needed to do something to perpetuate it. I was approached by Yale, Florida State University, the University of North Carolina.</p><p>Then my accountant told me I had to meet John Lahey, the president of Quinnipiac. He said we were both the same kind of hyper guys, we never stop, and we would like each other. We met in October last year, and we got along so well. We talked about prospects for the future, and he told me he had this 6,000-square-foot building available. I thought, here's a wonderful little private college, an up and coming college.</p><p>It was the best thing I have done in my Schweitzer career, and they are thrilled to have us here. Already, I have an agreement that when they build a 40,000-square-foot addition on the library, I will get 10,000 square feet, and I will give my collection to be put on display over there, so people can come from all over the world to study Albert Schweitzer over there.</p><p>And I continue to do things with other colleges. With Yale, I have instituted the Albert Schweitzer International Lecture Series. Jane Goodall spoke at the first one in April, and we had 1,600 people come to hear her. Former Costa Rican president Oscar Arias Sanchez will speak in October, and Benjamin Hooks will speak next February. For the 1994-95 academic year, we already have Bishop Tutu and the Dalai Lama. I am trying to get Jimmy Carter for the third one during the next academic year.</p><p>Q. Is there any organization you would compare yourself to?</p>                </div>
