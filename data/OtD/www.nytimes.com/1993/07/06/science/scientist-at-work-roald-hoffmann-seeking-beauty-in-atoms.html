    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  ROALD HOFFMANN Nobel laureate, professor of chemistry at Cornell University and poet -- glanced benignly at the stream of students passing his office window along a tranquil campus street. &quot;I love chemistry,&quot; he remarked, &quot;because it's sort of human in scale -- infinitely complex, but always tangible, always real.&quot;   Although Dr. Hoffman's pursuits include such practical goals as finding a cheap substitute for one of the precious metals used in automobile catalytic converters, he is mainly interested in the beauty that he perceives underlying even mundane applications of chemistry. Dr. Hoffmann's students know that his conception of &quot;beauty&quot; in chemistry particularly refers to the subtle symmetries and asymmetries of electron &quot;orbitals&quot; in complex molecules. He was awarded the 1981 Nobel prize in chemistry for his idea that chemical transformations could be approximately predicted from these symmetries. His method gave chemists a powerful tool for predicting the pathways that chemical reactions may follow.">

"I love chemistry," he remarked, "because it's sort of human in scale -- infinitely complex, but always tangible, always real."</p><p>Although Dr. Hoffman's pursuits include such practical goals as finding a cheap substitute for one of the precious metals used in automobile catalytic converters, he is mainly interested in the beauty that he perceives underlying even mundane applications of chemistry. Dr. Hoffmann's students know that his conception of "beauty" in chemistry particularly refers to the subtle symmetries and asymmetries of electron "orbitals" in complex molecules. He was awarded the 1981 Nobel prize in chemistry for his idea that chemical transformations could be approximately predicted from these symmetries. His method gave chemists a powerful tool for predicting the pathways that chemical reactions may follow.</p><p>His life is driven by the urge to share this beauty with others, in the language of poetry as well as that of quantum mechanics. And so he he is also the author of a series of books of essays, criticism and poetry, the latest of which, "Chemistry Imagined," written with Vivian Torrence and published by Smithsonian Institution Press, draws scientific allusion into poetry in somewhat the way poets draw symbolic allusions from classical mythology.</p><p>The quest for beauty leads almost inevitably to interesting science, in his view. A molecule may be needed because it is useful to industry or essential to life, but the best way to sketch it, Dr. Hoffmann says, may be to follow one's aesthetic sense rather than some mechanical recipe.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Palpable though chemical science may be, Dr. Hoffmann is not the kind of chemist who stains his fingers with laboratory reagents or cajoles recalcitrant salts into crystallizing from their solutions. He is a theorist and a poet, whose chemical intuition and personalized tool kit of mathematical tricks have pointed paths through many a knotty problem that had stumped experimentalists. Dr. Hoffmann's laboratory consists of his desk and his fountain pen, with which he produces graceful calligraphy as well as little pictures and diagrams much admired by other chemists, which symbolically describe the fruits of his theoretical research. He has barred all conventional laboratory paraphernalia -- even computers -- from his memento-cluttered office.</p><p>It is the awareness and appreciation of the aesthetic aspects of science rather than the mere toting up of numbers that leads to discovery, Dr. Hoffmann tells his graduate and postdoctoral students. In helping to impart this sense in them, he believes, he converts them into colleagues, fellow researchers as well as students.</p><p>At a recent symposium Dr. Hoffmann conducted for 10 of his fledgling scientists, the deceptively simple assignment had been to bring anything to the meeting that seemed interesting or beautiful.</p><p>At the end of two hours, the students, including one Russian, one Mexican and two Chinese, had analyzed, discussed and pondered enough material to launch a couple of doctoral dissertations, despite the group's steady stream of wisecracks over pizza and soft drinks.</p><p>"You can see why it is impossible for me to distinguish between teaching and research, much though the accountants would like me to do so," Dr. Hoffmann said later. "Science is a bridge between teaching and discovery, and my life has been spent building bridges."</p><p>Dr. Hoffman was born Roald Safran on July 18, 1937, in Zloczow, a town in the part of Poland that was later absorbed by the Soviet Union. After the German invasion in 1939 he and his parents, Hillel and Clara Safran, were sent to a labor camp as part of the Nazi roundup of Jews. Roald and his mother escaped, but Mr. Safran remained in the camp to help organize a breakout. The plan was betrayed, Mr. Safran was killed, and his wife and son remained hidden in the attic of a schoolhouse for the rest of the war.</p><p>Having survived the war, mother and son emigrated to the United States in 1949. His mother remarried and the boy took his stepfather's surname -- Hoffmann. The name Roald had been bestowed on him in honor of Roald Amundsen, the great Norwegian polar explorer.</p><p>Young Roald got such good grades in science that he was accepted at Stuyvesant High School -- one of New York City's preeminent science schools. "The concentration of intellect was really higher at Stuyvesant than anywhere else in my experience, including Columbia College and Harvard University graduate school," he recalls.</p><p>His academic experience at Columbia nearly diverted him from a career in science.</p><p>"At the time, Columbia's chemistry department was not as inspiring as the humanities departments. Mark Van Doren taught me poetry, I studied Japanese literature and I almost switched my major to art history.</p><p>"Like many middle-class American Jewish parents, mine wanted me to be a doctor, so I majored in premed, and the premed courses included chemistry. The chemistry fascinated me, and eventually I found the strength to declare that I would not become a doctor but would become a chemist," he said.</p>                </div>
