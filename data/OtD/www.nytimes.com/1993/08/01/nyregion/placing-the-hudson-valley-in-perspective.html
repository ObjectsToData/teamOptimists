But interest in the historical significance of the area is no longer confined to the region. This summer 25 college and university professors from throughout the country gathered at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie to study the national importance of an area that has produced great writers and painters and ultimately produced one of the first visions of a national culture for a fledgling America.   &quot;The Hudson River Valley is the nation's first self-consciously esthetic zone -- the first literal stretch of landscape that was elevated into a symbol of national identity and aspiration,&quot; said Dr. H. Daniel Peck, a professor of English at Vassar College. Dr. Peck was the director of a summer institute, called Hudson River Valley Images and Texts, which studied the region.">

But interest in the historical significance of the area is no longer confined to the region. This summer 25 college and university professors from throughout the country gathered at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie to study the national importance of an area that has produced great writers and painters and ultimately produced one of the first visions of a national culture for a fledgling America.   "The Hudson River Valley is the nation's first self-consciously esthetic zone -- the first literal stretch of landscape that was elevated into a symbol of national identity and aspiration," said Dr. H.

This summer 25 college and university professors from throughout the country gathered at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie to study the national importance of an area that has produced great writers and painters and ultimately produced one of the first visions of a national culture for a fledgling America.</p><p>"The Hudson River Valley is the nation's first self-consciously esthetic zone -- the first literal stretch of landscape that was elevated into a symbol of national identity and aspiration," said Dr. H. Daniel Peck, a professor of English at Vassar College. Dr. Peck was the director of a summer institute, called Hudson River Valley Images and Texts, which studied the region.</p><p>The institute, convened for the first time this year, was sponsored by the American Culture Program at Vassar College and supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The program ran from mid-June to mid-July and drew professors from universities as far away as California, Nevada and Wyoming.</p><p>The participants focused on the region in the 19th century, examining the art and literature that emerged side by side during that period. From that they drew a picture of a particularly American sensibility, one based on the valley but symbolic of the emerging country as a whole. For instance, they studied the work of the artist Thomas Cole, one of America's first great landscape painters, and compared his images of the Hudson River Valley with those described in Washington Irving's famous story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."

                    <p>"When Rip van Winkle goes into the woods for his 20-year sleep, Irving describes the wood in great detail," Dr. Peck said. "In a painting by Thomas Cole, you can see some very clear analogies in terms of what the landscape means, the moral and esthetic meanings for that generation of a forest or glen or a meadow."</p><p>Comparing the two genres side by side, Dr. Peck said, one could see not only how the European perspective informed the works but also how the new American vision breaks away and begins to define itself independently.</p><p>Those participating in the summer institute were given access to Vassar's Elias Lyman Magoon collection of Hudson River School paintings, which can be seen by the public when the college opens its new Art Center in November.</p><p>The Hudson River School is considered the first American native school of landscape painting, and the Vassar collection includes the work of such notable artists as Cole, Frederic E. Church, Asher B. Durand and Sanford Gifford.</p><p>The Hudson River Valley that these artists and writers depicted was a hub of economic activity in the 19th century, Dr. Peck said. When the Erie Canal was completed in 1824, the Hudson River became an important gateway to the Great Lakes and was central to the development of American commerce. Field Trips Offered</p><p>Not only did the area reflect America's economic modernization but also its cultural diversity. Several ethnic groups met in the Hudson Valley: the Dutch who had been in the area since the 17th century, the Yankee population from New England, Connecticut and Massachusetts and the indigenous American Indians. Further, slavery still existed in New York at the beginning of the century, and by the 1820's there was a free black population.</p><p>"You have a region that demonstrates some of the cultural richness of the new United States," said Dr. Scott Casper, a historian from the University of Nevada at Reno.</p><p>As part of the summer program, the professors took several field trips to put their studies of the region into a visual as well as historical context. They visited Olana, Church's home near Hudson in Columbia County, and Sunnyside, Washington Irving's home in Irvington. The participants also took a riverboat trip on the Hudson and visited Kaaterskill Falls, a once popular tourist destination near Haines Falls in Greene County. Their study of 19th-century artists also took them to the Albany Institute of History and Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New-York Historical Society, both in Manhattan. Weekly Themes</p><p>Several participants said that spending time on the river and in the area had enhanced their appreciation and understanding of the works they were studying.</p><p>"I had never thought much about the geography of the region," said Dr. Casper, the historian from the University of Nevada. "By looking at the river itself, by looking at the ways people shaped the land, I got a much better sense of this very real region and the paintings and writings that deal with it. If you don't actually see and experience the region, you think about the writings very differently."</p><p>The institute had a different theme each week. The first week, the professors studied the Dutch and English Colonial periods before the Revolutionary War. The focus was on material culture, examining furnishings and portrait paintings of early Dutch landholders. The second week covered the emergence of American literature and American landscape art in the 1820's.</p><p>Next, professors explored the cultural meanings of tourism in the early 19th century. This was a period of growing urbanization in America and a time when people who had the money to get out of the cities did so, Dr. Peck said. The Catskills were one of the first tourist destinations and were representative of emerging modern life. An entire session was spent talking about the Catskill Mountain House, a famous resort at that time near the Kaaterskill Falls. The building has since burned down, but the professors visited the site of the resort.</p><p>In the final week, they studied the literature of James Fenimore Cooper and the paintings of Cole. In the work of both are warnings about America's emerging imperialism and moral emptiness, Dr. Peck said.</p><p>"We really did prove to ourselves through the course of our study that the Hudson River Valley provided a paradigm for a national culture," Dr. Peck said. "That was immensely gratifying on the intellectual side. On the human side of it, there was a real richness in the kind of bonding that took place among the scholarly community. It was an extraordinary experience that left everyone feeling rewarded."</p><p>Photo: Jim Ryan, above at right and at left facing camera, leading college professors in the American Culture Program during tour of Olana, Frederic E.
