                    <p>CHARLES AGUADO is a favorite with the women at the Marrs Nursing Home here, where he volunteers as an ombudsman, but the men get his special attention. Older men tend to be withdrawn, he says, while women continue to form sociable relationships.</p><p>So on a recent visit to the home, when he saw an old man alone in a wheelchair, Mr. Aguado addressed him warmly. "What's doing, Harry?" he asked with a smile, and before long the two were laughing together.</p><p>Mr. Aguado, a retired clothier who looks far younger than his 68 years, has been walking these halls weekly for the last seven years, helping to arrange for new wheelchairs for elderly people who cannot afford to buy them, bringing donated magazines and books to help fill residents' empty hours and working behind the scenes to ease whatever family conflicts or complaints about the nursing home might arise.</p><p>Mr. Aguado is a member of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program sponsored by the county's Mental Health Association and financed by Federal funds distributed through the county's Office for the Aging. He said his role was mostly one of support and encouragement, but in recent years the scope of the ombudsman program has widened. Now volunteers like Mr. Aguado not only bring cheer to those living in retirement homes or skilled nursing homes but also keep watch over a host of residents' rights -- from receiving the proper nutrition to being adequately informed about procedures like making out a living will and appointing a health-care proxy, an individual with the right to make health-care decisions for someone who has become incapacitated.

                    <p>Since the Federal Patient Self-Determination Act took effect in December 1991, the county's ombudsmen have kept a watchful eye on the law's provisions, which include requiring health-care institutions to tell clients about their options to accept or refuse medical treatment and to choose such "advance directives" as proxies and living wills. Last year the group, which consists of 62 volunteers and 3 staff members who are based in White Plains, conducted a survey to determine how well the Patient Self-Determination Act was working in Westchester.</p><p>The director of the program, Phyllis Getlan, said the survey, which focused on the number of residents in adult homes and nursing homes who had appointed health-care proxies, turned up some unexpected results. Twenty-nine of 46 homes responded. While only 119 of the 4,234 residents had no available proxy to appoint, 1,176, or 27 percent, were considered incapable of appointing someone to make health-care decisions for them.</p><p>"We were surprised that so many people were being deemed incompetent without any formal determination," Ms. Getlan said. "This has to do with the way people live their lives. Why should it be any different from the way you have lived the rest of your life?"</p><p>Concerned that many elderly people were losing the little independence left to them, the ombudsman group sponsored a conference recently to explore the legal and ethical issues raised by the Patient Self-Determination Act. About 100 social workers, nurses and administrators of nursing homes and adult homes gathered at the Osborn Retirement Community in Rye to hear medical and legal experts discuss the subtle ways in which the law, which was intended to give the sick and elderly some control over their destinies, could be blunted.</p><p>Connie Zuckerman, an assistant professor of humanities and a teacher of health law and bioethics at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, warned that reducing the law to one more form to be filled out dilutes its intent. "The danger is that we'll be correct on paper, but we'll have lost the intimate communication between administration and resident to support that paper," she said. A Variety of Techniques</p><p>Thomas DiRosa, an official with the State Department of Health, said institutions should strive to reach people who may appear demented by using a variety of interviewing techniques, like speaking more slowly, gesturing and asking open-ended questions.</p><p>"Mental status is assessed in degrees" and may change both during the day and from day to day, he said. Checking off a box that declares a person incompetent "dismisses all those factors which may be changing or temporary and denies a person his rights."</p><p>Dr. Barnett Meyers, chief of the geriatric specialty clinic at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in White Plains, said competency was a legal matter that could be determined only by a judge, possibly with the advice of a psychiatrist.</p><p>"We're all considered competent unless a judge has said we're not," Dr. Meyers said. In nursing homes, therefore, "95 percent of residents are legally competent and required by law to receive advance directive information."</p><p>A key question is when to tell people about their rights to choose a health-care proxy or make out a living will, said Faith E. Fish, director of the state's Long-Term Care Ombudsman program. The best time may not be during admission to a nursing home, when an elderly person may be disoriented and upset, she said. The role of ombudsman in the process, she said, is to "reduce ambiguous situations that lead to court debates between health-care provider and consumer."</p><p>At the Marrs Nursing Home, Mr. Aguado, the ombudsman, said he worked closely with the home's administrator and with its director of social sciences, Cynthia Greenberg. Mrs. Greenberg said that she and the nursing staff tell new residents about the provisions of the Patient Self-Determination Act during their first week in the home and that most people appreciate hearing about their choices. Reassuring for Residents</p><p>"It's not traumatic information," she said. "They feel very reassured that they will not lose control, because they're losing control over so many other things."</p><p>Mr. Aguado said his experiences had taught him that the time to assign a health-care proxy was "when we're much younger."</p><p>"We shouldn't wait till we come in here," he said, referring to nursing homes in general.</p><p>The state requires new ombudsmen to attend a 36-hour training program to learn about entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid and about how the Department of Health and the Department of Social Services run long-term care institutions.</p><p>Ms. Getlan, the county's ombudsman director, said the training was also intended to help volunteers navigate the sometimes murky waters in nursing home disputes. Was the elderly woman telling the truth when she said she was not given meals for two days or did she forget that she had eaten, as the staff said? Should an ombudsman discuss a resident's complaint with a staff member if the resident has asked the ombudsman not to interfere? Some issues are clear, Ms. Getlan said. Ombudsmen are "required by law to report neglect or abuse" to the proper agency.</p><p>Training sessions for new ombudsmen are held twice a year in the county, in April and October. Last April 14 new volunteers were graduated, "a phenomenal number," Ms. Getlan said. But burnout can occur quickly, and two of those graduates have already left the program, she said. But when the match is right, the ombudsman program is "a wonderful form of therapy for everyone," Mr. Aguado said.</p><p>The county's next ombudsman training session will take place over six days between Oct. 4 and 22. An interview is required for participants. Ms. Getlan said that those wishing to make an appointment for an interview or to learn more about the program may call the Mental Health Association at 949-6741 and ask for the Long Term Care Ombudsman program.</p>                </div>
