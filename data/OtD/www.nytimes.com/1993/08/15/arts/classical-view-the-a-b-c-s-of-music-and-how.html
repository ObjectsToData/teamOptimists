    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Gather three inhabitants of the contemporary-music world in one place, and you may very likely have assembled four or five different opinions on nearly everything. But there will be only one opinion on education. Nobody is against it. Everybody is for it. Few, however, are getting it, and this is one reason for the low-grade anxiety that now permeates the classical-music scene.   Whatever minimal infrastructure once existed for the teaching of music in public schools has been dismantled during the last 20 years with almost horrific nonchalance. And without music education, the art-music traditions of the world come to seem merely sonic entertainments competing in a crowded aural marketplace for the right to provide pleasure.">

And without music education, the art-music traditions of the world come to seem merely sonic entertainments competing in a crowded aural marketplace for the right to provide pleasure.</p><p>An attempt is being made to change all that. As part of a national effort to develop "world class" standards in all subjects by the year 2000, attention is now being paid to the arts. Since last June, the Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts have given $600,000 to a consortium of arts education groups to develop standards in the field.</p><p>The consortium consists of the American Alliance for Theater and Education, the Music Educators National Conference, the National Art Education Association and the National Dance Association. Work on the standards is carried out by a 50-member committee, including politicians, academics and representatives of schools, businesses, museums, dance companies and conservatories.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Such a gathering might seem to insure disaster, a curriculum of special interests and fashionable ideas. But a draft of the curriculum in music, dance, theater and the visual arts is now available, and at least in music, it is an impressive document. It will soon be circulated nationally to test public reaction. (Information is available by telephone: 703-860-4000.) A final report will be published in the winter.</p><p>There are, in the draft, warning signs of what might have been and what may still be: The words "empowerment" and "self-esteem" buzz along now and then, as do signs of political correctness. (The musician as social activist is prominent; the composer of religious music is almost invisible.) But this document signals a major turning point in arts education. It avoids the vocabulary of pop psychology, treating the arts not as techniques for self-expression and self-fulfillment but as systems of knowledge. "Excellence and quality in the arts are not merely matters of opinion," it proclaims. And while cultural diversity is properly praised for being a "vast resource for arts education" and world cultures are included in the curriculum, the emphasis is on educating students to be "participants in a common culture."</p><p>These statements may be simple genuflections to make the arts seem as palatable for assessors as mathematics and spelling. But the broad goals are backed by requirements in three categories: creating and performing, perceiving and analyzing, cultural and historical contexts. They are outlined separately for kindergarten through fourth grade, the fifth through eighth grades, and high school. The particulars are left to individual schools. Other organizations are beginning to design tests and tools for evaluation.</p><p>More details and examples are needed to fill out the curriculum, but it inspires hope at a dark time. If anything, in fact, the curriculum may be too ambitious. Consider just music.</p><p>By the fifth grade, the standards urge, students should be able to read musical notation and use it to express simple musical ideas; they should be able to listen to music with focused attention, answer questions about it and learn more from repeated hearings; they should even be able to develop critical judgments about the effectiveness of a performance. Singing is part of the curriculum; so are instrumental study and improvisational and compositional techniques. The students are expected to recognize genre distinctions in Western art music as well as in jazz, pop, folk music and areas of of non-Western music.</p><p>After two years of high school, students would be expected to sing music with four or more parts, play at least one instrument well enough "to derive satisfaction from performing alone and with others," improvise on given materials or within the conventions of a particular style and analyze examples from the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods as well as from four distinct 20th-century styles (including two non-Western styles).</p><p>These are admirable ambitions -- so admirable, given the current state of education, that they seem almost quixotic, trying to include everything. How can such a music curriculum be added to theater, dance and visual arts programs of similar ambition, all within 15 percent of the school day? How will the committee resist pressure to dilute the dominance of Western music in the curriculum -- essential to its academic and philosophical success? How will teachers be found to train students in analysis, performance and history? Where will financing come from to transform schoolrooms and buy instruments and recordings?</p><p>How, in other words, can schools alone provide what should be part of the living experience of a child, in and out of school? That familiar question may end up being the most challenging, and not just for music.</p>                </div>
