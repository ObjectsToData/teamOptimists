But since Blair began a mathematics, science and computer magnet program eight years ago, the public high school has drawn top-flight students from throughout Montgomery County while gaining national attention. The school produced three of the 40 finalists in this year's Westinghouse Science Talent Search, the nation's most prestigious math and science competition for high school students, after having two finalists in each of the previous two years.">

                    <p>Blair "has exceeded my wildest expectations," said Paul Vance, the superintendent for Montgomery County public schools. "I have never seen a high school's image turn around so quickly."</p><p>The enriched math, science and computer program at Blair was designed to lure whites and Asians into the predominantly black and Hispanic school district, which is in the part of the county that abuts Washington. The county is more than 75 percent white.</p><p>In the early 1980's, the Montgomery County School Board faced strong community pressure to desegregate Blair, including threats of lawsuits. The board responded with a survey to find out what kind of specialized curriculum would lead parents to send their children to a school outside the mostly white districts.</p><p>A science program proved the most enticing. Dr. Michael Haney, the program's first coordinator and its primary architect, suspects that the prospect of a fancy laboratory excited many parents. "Parents understand that a special science program demands special equipment," he said. Low Minority Enrollment</p><p>There are 377 students in the Blair magnet program, only 58 of them from Blair's own school district. Black and Hispanic students make up less than 15 percent of those in the magnet program, though they make up 60 percent of the students at the regular high school.</p><p>The magnet students follow a diversified research-oriented course of study in math and science, but they participate in the school's regular curriculum for the humanities, physical education and the arts. More than 500 eighth-graders have applied for next year's 100 freshman openings.  Selection is based on grades, standardized test scores and the completion of algebra by the eighth grade.</p><p>With extra start-up money provided by the county and state, Dr. Haney outfitted the program with sophisticated technology, including 60 microcomputers for the computer laboratory and chromatographs and advanced spectraphotometers for the chemistry laboratory. The annual budget for equipment and materials, about $78,000, is more than twice that of the regular science department.</p><p>James Redos, the chairman of the regular science department, believes that the equipment, particularly the computers, gives students in the magnet program a substantial competitive edge in national science contests. "Westinghouse," he said, "is hot on computers."</p><p>All three of Blair's Westinghouse finalists, in fact, used computers in their projects. One of them, Elizabeth Mann, showed how to use supercomputers to store large blocs of data more efficiently. The other two finalists, Steve Chien and Wei-Hwa Huang, used computers to calculate certain theorems for their expansions of popular mathematical games.  'Home' Student a Winner</p><p>Miss Mann is one of the few magnet students who lives within walking distance of the school, while Mr. Chien and Mr. Huang spend more than an hour a day getting to and from the school. All three are seniors.</p><p>Dr. Haney and all three finalists agreed that the program's heavy emphasis on research was the most valuable part of the curriculum and the aspect that best prepared them for the Westinghouse competition.</p><p>Under the magnet program, juniors are required to work on a two-year research project under the tutelage of a faculty adviser and, frequently, an outside mentor. The program has its own research coordinator to help students find sources and outside scholars, who often come from Washington institutions like the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>"If I'd gone to my home school, I doubt very much that I'd have ever done a research project," Mr. Chien said. "My home school doesn't encourage that kind of thing. Blair makes you believe that research is something you should and can do, rather than something you might happen to do."</p><p>"This program isn't like others where you read the books, do the labs, and answer the questions," Mr. Huang said. "This program tells you what real science work is like."</p><p>But some experts fear that such magnet programs send a troubling message to most minorities, because they may suggest that academically challenging programs are more likely to attract white and Asian students than black and Hispanic ones.</p><p>"The image is, the fewer blacks and Latinos in it, the more elite the program," said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor and psychiatrist at Harvard University who specializes in the psychological health of minority children. "You have to have the black and Latino students represented in adequate and significant numbers."</p><p>Phillip Gainous, the principal of Blair, said he was aware of that hazard and recently tried to step up the recruitment of black, Hispanic and female students for the program.</p><p>Dr. Poussaint and other scholars also fear that the system, while set up to integrate the school, may produce "in-house segregation."</p><p>While many students in the magnet program said this was true, some said the feeling of separation had been overcome by the students, who participate in extracurricular activities and take electives outside the program.</p><p>Still, among the regular students, Mr. Chien said: "There is some animosity toward the program, because we have better funding. It's almost like a class disparity within the school."</p><p>Magnet teachers and administrators are acutely aware of this rift. To diminish it, the program has made its technological resources available to other students, though magnet students have first priority. In addition, a broad array of elective courses offered by the magnet program is open to everyone.</p><p>Dr. Vance, the superintendent, said the Blair magnet program had changed more than the academic face of the school. "Ten years ago," he said, "youngsters weren't proud to say they went to Montgomery Blair. Today, you can't believe the school's high spirit and enthusiasm."</p><p>Photo: Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md., has produced 3 of the 40 finalists in this year's Westinghouse Science Talent Search, the nation's most prestigious math and science competition for high school students.
