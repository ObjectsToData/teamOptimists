Ever since 1991, the 10th anniversary of his ascension to cultural power, Mr. Lang and his ministry's busy publicity people have been in what might be called a defensively self-celebratory mood.

More recently, as his enemies swelled in numbers, a counterattack has seemed all the more imperative. And on balance, the judgment of posterity is likely to be favorable indeed on the French Socialists' achievements in the field of culture.</p><p>Mr. Lang's office, which he will soon have to vacate, is a gilt-laden salon in the Palais Royal, with palatial antechambers receding into the distance. In a post-modernist juxtaposition perhaps symbolic of the Socialist esthetic, it overlooks a courtyard to which stark, black-and-white-striped pillars by the artist Daniel Buren lend a jarring accent. The minister himself, natty as ever despite the melancholy of the moment, willingly toted up his successes and failures in a recent conversation. High Stakes for Culture</p><p>Mr. Lang owes his popularity and political longevity to his charisma and skills, but also to a deliberate decision made 12 years ago by Mr. Mitterrand to up the French cultural ante to levels unmatched in modern times. The figures are staggering, especially in comparison with the meager level of cultural subsidy in the United States. They make the French Government by far the world's most lavish cultural patron, and Mr. Lang far and away the world's most powerful cultural politician.</p>                </div>

                    <p>There are 12,500 people in the Ministry of Culture's direct employ. At a time when cultural budgets throughout the world have shrunk, France's has escalated steadily; between 1992 and 1993 it expanded by 6.5 percent, twice the rate of the overall national budget. In the years since Mr. Lang first became Minister of Culture (the only surviving member of Mr. Mitterrand's first cabinet, he was out of power from 1986 to 1988, but the conservative interlude amounted to only a hitch in his plans) the ministry's budget has more than doubled, from less than half of 1 percent of the total budget to a fraction under 1 percent.</p><p>That means, at current exchange rates, $2.3 billion annually for 1993, compared with $176 million at the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington (plus $187 million more at the National Endowment for the Humanities). Per capita -- although the jurisdictions aren't quite parallel -- America spends $1.43 on culture per citizen compared with nearly $41 in France, some 29 times as much. That's not counting regional and municipal expenditures, which are far higher in France, and private arts support, which is higher in America, although Mr. Lang has encouraged such donations as well. Cynicism About Reasons</p><p>Why this overwhelming emphasis on the arts? Cynics claim that Mr. Mitterrand has done it purely for ego, to leave his imprint in stone like some puffed-up Socialist Sun King, and that Mr. Lang has abetted this desire like a court jester. Others have suggested that the Socialists have courted artists and intellectuals out of narrow political calculation.</p><p>Such suspicions, reinforced by a general impatience that has fueled the Socialist electoral defeat, have led to a burst of anti-Lang diatribes, chiefly two much-discussed books, Marc Fumaroli's "Cultural State" and Michel Schneider's vitriolic "Comedy of Culture." The editor of Le Figaro's weekly magazine, Louis Pauwels, complained that "the Socialists abused and manipulated culture so much that now it's turning against them."</p><p>In Britain and the United States, mockery of French intellectual pretensions and of Mr. Lang's ego and sometimes flamboyant pandering to popular culture has long been in vogue. Few seem willing to consider that at least one small part of his and Mr. Mitterrand's motives might have been a simple love for art and admiration for artists.</p><p>Such complaints slight the long history of French arts support. France has long been a highly centralized state, and French leaders have long used culture to glorify the state and themselves. No one seems to care now that Louis IV and Napoleons I and III were not unmindful of their own personal glory. In fact, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Lang have presided over the most far-reaching alteration in French cultural life, and in the landscape of Paris, since Baron Haussmann cut through the medieval tangle and laid out the city's broad boulevards in the 1860's. Future Generations in Mind</p><p>Beneath an often glitzy surface, their achievements have touched nearly every aspect of French cultural life. And, though he has only held his additional portfolio as Minister of Education for less than a year, Mr. Lang has begun a serious reform of French arts education for future generations, as well.</p><p>Particularly striking are the so-called Grands Projets, most of them in Paris and serving (often literally) as concrete monuments to the gloire of Mr. Mitterrand, who personally instigated most of them. These range from the almost universally acclaimed (I. M. Pei's glass pyramids at the Louvre, which is itself being modernized and much enlarged) to the derided (Mr. Buren's Palais Royal pillars). There is the Grande Arche de La Defense, a modern echo of the Arc de Triomphe; the cold and commanding Bastille Opera, and the still-controversial, unfinished National Library.</p>                </div>
