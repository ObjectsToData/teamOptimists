To be exact, it was 2,786 miles away in Los Angeles.   As the president of Mount Saint Michael Academy, he recently traveled to the West Coast to meet with a select handful of alumni who he hoped would become major contributors to the school's $6 million capital campaign. He had already done his research, thanks in part to a computerized data bank that provided him with details about the lives and careers of the school's alumni.">

                    <p>"I don't think we were as aggressive as we are today," said Brother Iazzetti. "We used to set up appeals and wait for whatever came in. But we saw the writing on the wall two or three years ago. Development has become very critical."</p><p>His trip to Los Angeles was in addition to the school's annual drive, whose mail and phone appeals raise enough money to bridge the $1.3 million annual gap between tuition revenues and the cost of educating the school's 1,200 students. He is helped in these efforts by his school's full-time development officer, and he can tap the professional expertise of the school's directors.</p><p>The efforts of Brother Iazzetti and other leaders of Catholic schools are born of simple math -- declining numbers of religious faculty who worked for modest stipends have been replaced by growing numbers of lay teachers who are demanding more competitive salaries. That transition comes at a time when urban parochial schools are enrolling many students whose families are hard-pressed to come up with tuition, which on average covers two-thirds of what it costs to run a school.</p><p>Making matters worse, many dioceses are facing their own financial problems, forcing them to cut back, if not eliminate, the subsidies that once kept their schools afloat in lean times. Two years ago, the 11 high schools run by the Archdiocese of New York were told to find ways to cut expenses by half and to work toward operating on balanced budgets. Policy Change Sought</p><p>Advocates for Catholic schools would like to see a change in government policy, especially regarding tuition tax credits, and a report by a panel appointed by State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol last week recommended a limited state tax credit for parents who send their children to parochial schools. School advocates expect such a change would be difficult to accomplish.</p><p>"That's a process we have no direct control over," said Sister Mary Burke, the associate executive director of the National Catholic Education Association's secondary school department. "The piece we are capable of acting on is the development and marketing piece."</p><p>Since the 1970's, the group has been alerting the nation's 1,249 Catholic high schools of the need to pursue more innovative fund-raising efforts. Ten years ago, the group held its first symposium on development, attracting a handful of people. At its last convention, Sister Burke said, 500 administrators attended about 50 different workshops on fund-raising techniques. A Full-Time Job</p><p>According to recent surveys by the organization, 85 percent of the nation's Catholic schools have hired full-time development directors, while 20 percent have split the top administrative job into two positions. At Mount Saint Michael, for instance, the principal tends to the school's academic vitality, freeing Brother Iazzetti to devote his attention to finances and fund raising.</p><p>Most of the fund-raising efforts have low-tech beginnings, with administrators dusting off yearbooks and hauling out long-forgotten school records in their search for alumni. Some use specialized consultants to produce computerized lists of addresses and to design questionnaires to gather detailed information on the alumni. They pay special attention to where they went to college, where they live, their business titles and whether they have children in college or about to enter it -- all indicators of their ability to contribute.</p><p>"A very important part of fund raising is market segmentation," said George Ruotolo, a consultant whose client list includes several hundred Catholic schools nationwide.  'Where the Memories Are'</p><p>At All Hallows Institute in the South Bronx, Brother Lawrence T. Murphy presides over a flurry of development efforts that began over a decade ago and currently raise $175,000 to $200,000 annually for the school. For the last three months, a weekend has not passed without some reunion, where alumni are grouped by class, occupation and location. He avoids giving potential donors the hard sell, preferring to lay out briefly the school's importance and financial status before stepping out of the way. Follow-up letters and calls go out a few weeks later.</p>                </div>
