    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  For the last 20 years, few investments have been as popular with individuals, year in and year out, as municipal bonds. Riding the coattails of that infatuation, John Nuveen &amp; Company, a Chicago firm, has emerged as one of the most profitable securities firms by dint of its various municipal bond mutual funds.    In an industry where many firms see diversification as a key to prosperity, even survival, Nuveen has sidestepped the trend by limiting itself to municipal bonds. It is a strategy that executives justify on the ground of superior profits and a corporate philosophy that goes back to the firm's founding 95 years ago by John Nuveen, a dry goods merchant.">

                    <p>For the last 20 years, few investments have been as popular with individuals, year in and year out, as municipal bonds. Riding the coattails of that infatuation, John Nuveen &amp; Company, a Chicago firm, has emerged as one of the most profitable securities firms by dint of its various municipal bond mutual funds.</p><p>In an industry where many firms see diversification as a key to prosperity, even survival, Nuveen has sidestepped the trend by limiting itself to municipal bonds. It is a strategy that executives justify on the ground of superior profits and a corporate philosophy that goes back to the firm's founding 95 years ago by John Nuveen, a dry goods merchant.</p><p>Mr. Nuveen, whose travels in the Midwest impressed upon him the need for government spending on projects like roads and water systems, felt that the good repayment record of municipal bonds and their essential role in financing such projects made for a business where his firm could do well by doing good.  Several Objectives</p><p>"Municipal bonds are special, because they are a way for individuals to earn income and preserve wealth and at the same time do something for the public good," said Richard J. Franke, Nuveen's chairman. Mr. Franke has pushed Nuveen to become the largest company in municipal bond mutual funds and has reduced its old-line business of trading and selling new bond issues, and he still sees concentrating on municipal bonds as a key to high profitability.</p>                </div>

                    <p>"By focusing on that market, we are not distracted by 300 other products," he said. A reputation in a single market also makes it easier to persuade the securities brokers, bankers, financial advisers and insurance agents who sell mutual funds that they should handle Nuveen products.</p><p>Last year, Nuveen did well enough to earn $59 million, mostly from the fees collected for managing $27 billion of municipal bond funds held by a million individuals, or one out of every four taxpayers who earned municipal bond interest. Last year, when outsized profits were the rule among securities firms, Nuveen earned a higher return on its capital, 34 percent, than such highly regarded firms as Merrill Lynch or Franklin Resources, a mutual fund company. Richard S. Goleniewski of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company called Nuveen's pretax profit margin of 44 percent of revenues "astounding."</p><p>The big profits were largely a result of a decision five years ago to introduce a new kind of municipal bond fund: "leveraged" funds, with yields roughly 30 percent above those of nonleveraged funds. As an added filip, the funds were listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- a key feature to brokers' customers more familiar with stocks than bonds.</p><p>The higher yield results from the sale of preferred stock in each fund. The preferred pays interest at low, short-term interest rates but the money from their sale is invested in higher-yielding long-term bonds. The difference is added to the return collected by common shareholders.</p><p>The funds are expensive: investors buying the initial offering pay a 6.3 percent fee to securities dealers, in addition to an annual management fee to Nuveen of 65-hundredths of a percentage point. But the funds proved well suited for the period of stable and declining interest rates that have prevailed since 1988.</p><p>Imitators of leveraged funds quickly appeared, but Nuveen has more than $20 billion outstanding, or about 40 percent of the market.</p><p>With record profits and Nuveen's business growing rapidly, its owner, the St. Paul Companies, a Minnesota insurance concern, decided last year that the time was ripe to sell part of the company. At a price of $18 a share, the eight million Nuveen shares, representing 26 percent of the company, sold quickly and have since increased to $33.375 a share.</p><p>St. Paul bought Nuveen for $10 million in 1974 when Nuveen was still recovering from a disastrous foray into the markets for corporate and Treasury securities in the 1960's. St. Paul has earned about 30 percent annually on the investment, and still owns a 74 percent stake in the company, worth about $750 million.</p><p>"I wish I could say it shows how smart we are," said Patrick Thiele, chief financial officer at St. Paul. "But we inherited an extraordinary management team," he said, and St. Paul's role was to "give them the backing they needed to grow without being forced to diversify or be swallowed by somebody larger."</p><p>Nuveen executives were also allowed to foster a corporate culture noticeably different from that at other firms. M.B.A.'s are less likely to be hired than are humanities majors, and senior executives are sent to study arts and social sciences at Stanford for a semester.</p><p>In contrast to other firms in municipal securities, Nuveen and its employees do not make campaign contributions to government officials who select the firms to sell new bond issues. The policy has cost the firm some business and is one reason it is a minor player in distributing new issues, said Edward Dunn, a vice president, "but it was just not the kind of activity we could tolerate."
