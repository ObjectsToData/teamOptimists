The slipper, signed by members of the dance division faculty, was presented to Dr. Grebstein in honor of his retirement next month after 12 years as the president of SUNY Purchase.    The juxtaposition of the pointed shoe and books on American literature, Dr. Grebstein's academic specialty, is emblematic of the institution that he has guided through declining state support and rising enrollment since 1981. He leaves, he said, regretting that he could not create the &quot;marvelous synergy&quot; he envisioned between the School for the Arts and the College of Letters and Science, two of the campus's main divisions. (The third is the division of continuing education.) That dream was thwarted, he said, by the continual budget cuts that have plagued SUNY Purchase during most of his tenure.">

The slipper, signed by members of the dance division faculty, was presented to Dr. Grebstein in honor of his retirement next month after 12 years as the president of SUNY Purchase.</p><p>The juxtaposition of the pointed shoe and books on American literature, Dr. Grebstein's academic specialty, is emblematic of the institution that he has guided through declining state support and rising enrollment since 1981. He leaves, he said, regretting that he could not create the "marvelous synergy" he envisioned between the School for the Arts and the College of Letters and Science, two of the campus's main divisions. (The third is the division of continuing education.) That dream was thwarted, he said, by the continual budget cuts that have plagued SUNY Purchase during most of his tenure.</p><p>Yet he also says he leaves a "more mature and less turbulent campus," one less split by rivalries and more amenable to cooperative programs between divisions, if only the money for such programs could be found.</p><p>In an interview in his book-lined office, a scene of frequent meetings and dinners as well as two student demonstrations during his term, Dr. Grebstein reflected on the campus's latest controversy, over the manner in which the new president, Bill Lacy, was chosen. Dr. Grebstein said he took no part in the conflict, in which members of the search committee accused the members of the College Council -- the SUNY Purchase trustees -- of abusing their power in selecting Mr. Lacy over Stanley Fish, a well-known, if controversial, literature and law professor at Duke University, whom most search committee members had favored. Mr. Fish, an ardent multiculturalist, has been at the center of the academic culture wars, epitomizing to some the excesses of political correctness.

                    <p>"I've never believed in presidents choosing their successors," Dr. Grebstein said, adding that the most important thing about Mr. Lacy, an architect and the current administrator of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, was that "he knows how to be president." As the former president of Cooper Union in Manhattan and the American Academy in Rome, Mr. Lacy, who will assume his position on July 26, has extensive fund-raising and administrative experience.</p><p>Dr. Grebstein said he didn't think the newest dispute -- which appeared to underscore the historic tensions here between the various faculties -- would have a long-lasting effect on the 22-year-old institution. "I don't believe there's a deep, permanent chasm that has been cosmetically patched over" at the 4,000-student campus, he said.</p><p>Casually dressed in a plaid sport shirt on a sparkling spring morning, the 65-year-old Dr. Grebstein appeared pleased with his accomplishments as president and at peace with the criticisms made against him. Many credit him with keeping up morale on campus during the past decade as the college lost 96 out of 539 state-supported positions -- only 5 of which, he said proudly, were faculty --and millions of dollars in state funds. More Subtle Than Imperial</p><p>Others, however, say he has been overly protective of faculty positions at the expense of other important jobs. Dr. Alfred N. Hunt, dean of the College of Letters and Science, complained that the position of vice president for finance and management, a job he said was "worth eight faculty members," had been left vacant for two years. Dr. Hunt, who heads an ad hoc budget committee and has seen several presidents come and go in his 17 years on the faculty, said he would give Dr. Grebstein's performance a B. "There has been a real, decided lack of leadership," Dr. Hunt said.</p><p>To such criticism, Dr. Grebstein replied, "Purchase still wishes for more leadership than it can stand," and defended his own style as more subtle than imperial. He has won the admiration of educators like Marcia A. Savage, the president of Manhattanville College here, who in a telephone interview praised Dr. Grebstein's efforts to "find a balance between the original mission of the institution" as a performing arts school and "the increasing demands of market needs" in the liberal arts. During Dr. Grebstein's tenure, nine new degree or certificate programs were begun in the liberal arts division, while three masters of fine arts programs were started in the School for the Arts.</p><p>Joseph N. Hankin, president of Westchester Community College in Valhalla, said he confidently sent many graduates of his two-year institution to SUNY Purchase for further study. Noting that this was a compliment to Dr. Grebstein, he added, "Sheldon has humanized the place tremendously."</p><p>Many people find the Purchase campus startlingly austere at first, and some say it would be a warmer place if it had faculty housing, for example, or something to bring professors together after class. From Dr. Grebstein's perspective, however, the campus is far livelier than when he arrived from the State University at Binghamton, where he was dean of arts and sciences and dean of Harpur College, the undergraduate liberal arts division at Binghamton.</p>                </div>
