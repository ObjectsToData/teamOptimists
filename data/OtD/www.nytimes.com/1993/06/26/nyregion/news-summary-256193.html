	data-description="  International 2-5 RIGHTS FORUM BACKS U.N. ROLE   The human rights conference in Vienna ended on a surprisingly optimistic note as delegates urged the U.N. to play a larger role in denouncing abuses and endorsed a U.S. proposal for a post of High Commissioner on Human Rights.  2 WHITES STORM SOUTH AFRICA TALKS   Hundreds of armed white separatists stormed South Africa's constitutional talks to dramatize their bitterness at the approach of black majority rule and then dispersed without causing any serious casualties.  3 NIGERIAN VOWS DEMOCRACY   Nigeria's military leader insisted that a democratically elected government would be installed as scheduled in August, despite his annulment of presidential elections.  3 RUSSIANS OFFER HUGS IN CHINA   Yichang Journal: All over China, young Russian women are working in bars, restaurants and even massage parlors. Customers pay restaurants a $33 surcharge for having a Russian woman at the table, plus a typical tip of $10.  4 RUSSIA HALTS GAS TO ESTONIA   Russia halted deliveries of natural gas to Estonia in a move seen as retribution for a new residency law that requires residents who have not applied for citizenship to apply for a residence permit within two years or else leave the country.  4 CLINTON WARNS IRAQ OVER U.N.   President Clinton warned Iraq that its refusal to allow U.N. inspectors to monitor missile test sites could have "quite serious" consequences, but officials said the U.S. was not planning immediate military action.  4 U.S. WEIGHS MIDEAST ENVOY   The Clinton Administration expressed dissatisfaction with the Middle East peace talks and said it might send an envoy to the area to help move things along.  4 CAMPBELL TAKES OFFICE IN CANADA   Kim Campbell was sworn in as the first woman to head the Government of Canada and, in her first official step as the country's 19th Prime Minister, announced its smallest Cabinet in 20 years.  5 BOSNIA PEACE TALKS IN DOUBT   The Bosnian President's opposition to a Serbian-Croatian plan for his country is threatening to create a split in Bosnia's collective leadership and to cripple attempts by mediators to reach an accord.  5 GAINS IN EARTH SUMMIT ACCORDS   Tension between rich nations and poor ones uncommonly eased as the panel created to translate the environmental accords of the 1992 Earth Summit into action ended its first substantive session at the U.N.  5 ISRAELI PREMIER IS BELEAGUERED   Israel's Prime Minister found his Government's stability called into question once again with the looming indictment of his Interior Minister on corruption charges.  5 National 6-8 CLINTON HOPEFUL ON FINAL BUDGET   Hours after the Senate passed his economic package, President Clinton said he believed the House and Senate would be able to compromise on a final version.  1 DISCRIMINATION HARDER TO PROVE   Ruling in an important civil rights case, a divided Supreme Court made it substantially harder for employees to prove they suffered discrimination on the job.  1 COURT UPHOLDS DAMAGE AWARD   The Supreme Court upheld a $10 million award of punitive damages for a $19,000 injury, disappointing critics of the civil justice system who wanted the Court to limit awards.  8 STATEN ISLAND BASE WILL CLOSE   A Presidential commission voted to close the Staten Island Homeport and move its ships and sailors south, virtually ending any significant Navy presence in New York City.  1 SESSIONS AS FIGUREHEAD   As crises flared, the F.B.I. Director was traveling on the West Coast, with little information about either a serial bomber or the terrorist plot uncovered in New York.  1 FOLLOWING A SERIAL BOMBER   Investigators have developed a portrait of a serial bomber they have tracked for years and who they say struck again twice this week.  6 HUMANITIES NOMINEE AGAINST 'P.C.'   The President's nominee to head the National Endowment for the Humanities denounced campus efforts to control speech.  6 President Clinton spoke to his putative half-brother by telephone.  6 NEW LEADER FOR CHICAGO SCHOOLS   A deputy schools chancellor in New York City, Argie Johnson, will be the general superintendent of the Chicago school system.  6 Beliefs: An institute is strengthening the faith of Catholic scholars.  26 Metro Digest 21 OTHERS SOUGHT IN BOMBING PLOT   Federal authorities said yesterday that they have identified more suspects in the plot to bomb buildings and tunnels in New York, but were waiting for prosecutors to decide when to make the arrests.  1 A WARTIME CONNECTION   Experience in the Afghanistan war is emerging as a fervid common denominator among the suspects arrested this week in the plot to bomb and terrorize New York City.  1 DECEPTION BY EMPIRE DESCRIBED   In testimony yesterday before a United States Senate subcommittee, two former employees of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield provided the first public evidence that the insurer intentionally misled New York State officials.  1 Business Digest35 Arts/Entertainment 9-14 AUTHOR INVENTED KENNEDY WORDS   The publisher Simon & Schuster admitted that Joe McGinness's book on Senator Edward M.
