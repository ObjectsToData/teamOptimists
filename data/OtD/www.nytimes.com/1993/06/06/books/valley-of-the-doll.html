                    <p>JUDY GARLAND The Secret Life of an American Legend. By David Shipman. Illustrated. 540 pp. New York: Hyperion. $24.95.</p><p>THE glamorous, tawdry lives of Hollywood stars are the hero sagas of modern life. Born in obscurity, driven by a dream, the great stars fight their way to fame and win their dates with destiny. But fortune's wheel is ever turning: a combination of hostile external forces and swirling internal pressures transforms triumph and adulation into disaster and despair.</p><p>This classic paradigm, half Greek tragedy and half soap opera, is remarkably demonstrated in David Shipman's absorbing new biography, "Judy Garland: The Secret Life of an American Legend." Mr. Shipman, a British film historian, treats his sensational material with a sober earnestness that at first seems flat and unadventurous but that eventually wins our respect and trust. A fan of Garland's since he "fell in love with her in a record shop in Oxford in 1955," he presents her flamboyant personality with unflinching honesty, neither moralizing nor minimizing her faults. Mr. Shipman's scandal-packed book reads like the war chronicles of a laconic, unflappable battlefront correspondent, with explosions going off and casualties everywhere.</p><p>Judy Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922 in Grand Rapids, Minn. Her father, a singer and manager of a movie theater, had left Tennessee with visions of show business. He was also, according to Mr. Shipman, a homosexual. Garland's mother, who knew of and later bitterly resented her husband's proclivities, had two daughters by him and then tried to abort Frances, the third. Garland claimed that her pushy mother took "great delight in telling rooms full of people" about these attempts to prevent the child from being born.</p>                </div>

                    <p>As "Baby Gumm," Frances made her singing debut at 2 1/2 and brought down the house with her strangely powerful voice, out of which came her mature "belting" style. Garland said her talent was "inherited": "Nobody ever taught me what to do onstage." The Gumms moved to southern California in 1926 to promote the career of their tiny song-and-dance trio, the Gumm Sisters. Frances was already spoiled and given to "sudden, terrible fits of temper." She rapidly turned into an androgynous tomboy, "as if," says Mr. Shipman, "she were becoming the son" her father had craved.</p><p>Before long a boom time began for child actors: Hollywood studios beat the bushes for the next Shirley Temple, who was America's panacea for the Depression. One night, George Jessel, introducing the Gumm girls, renamed them the Garland Sisters. Frances boldly took the name Judy from a Hoagy Carmichael song. Jessel later said of Judy, who had been billed as "the little girl with the leather lungs," that even at 12 she sang like "a woman with a heart that had been hurt."</p><p>Now began the period in Garland's life most familiar to us. Under contract at 13 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, she made several films, including her first with Mickey Rooney and leading up to "The Wizard of Oz" (1939). Garland said of these years, when she shuttled between the set and the studio schoolroom, "My life was a combination of absolute chaos and absolute solitude." She was made to starve what Mr. Shipman calls her "naturally pudgy" body, and she secretly squirreled away cookies and candy bars from the studio spies watching her every move.</p><p>Garland, Mr. Shipman reports, was soon taking appetite-suppressing amphetamines, as well as Seconal prescribed by the studio doctor. She needed pills to fall asleep and pills to wake up. By 20, she was seriously addicted, in a vicious lifelong cycle that would be dramatized in Jacqueline Susann's wonderful "Valley of the Dolls," which was inspired by her. Mr. Shipman says that near the end of her life (she died in 1969) Garland was taking large quantities of alcohol and barbiturates, as well as up to 20 Ritalin tablets a day.</p><p>While her public image in the late 1930's was as "America's favorite kid sister," studio insiders knew, as Mr. Shipman puts it, that "the real Judy Garland was intense, headstrong, volatile." She married impetuously and found herself "completely unfitted" to run a house. She had her first two abortions and began to have affairs with both men and women, he writes.</p><p>Always drawn to gay men, Garland finally married one, the director Vincente Minnelli, who became her second husband and -- to the astonishment of Hollywood sophisticates -- the unmistakable father of her daughter Liza. Garland's behavior was becoming "increasingly erratic." Mr. Shipman reproduces fascinating M-G-M memos from such troubled productions as "Meet Me in St. Louis," which tartly record Garland's lateness and surliness. Paralyzed by insecurity, she kept the whole set waiting day after day, much as Marilyn Monroe would do a decade later. After completing "The Pirate" (1947), Garland made her first suicide attempt and was forced to enter a sanitarium.</p><p>In 1950, after repeated incidents in which Garland's unreliable behavior added "as much as 20 percent" to the budget of her films, M-G-M fired her. She slashed her throat but lived. When the news of her suicide attempt leaked and made headlines, her career entered a bizarre new phase. Jobless and tormented, she was startled to find herself mobbed by idolatrous fans screaming, "We love you, Judy!" Her humiliation and suffering had made her an international diva, locked into a passionate symbiotic relationship with a cult audience that was heavily gay.</p><p>Garland's successive comebacks were engineered by her third husband, Sid Luft, whom Mr. Shipman credits with shrewd business sense and the patience of Job. There were stunning live performances in long sold-out engagements at the London Palladium and the Palace Theater in New York, which are still remembered by those lucky enough to have attended as peak moments in 20th-century music. Garland's film career, except for "A Star Is Born" (1954), a box-office failure, was essentially over.</p><p>Mr. Shipman's book is strongest in documenting Garland's uniqueness and mesmerizing virtuosity as a stage performer in the 1950's and 60's. There are lavish citations from ecstatic British and American reviews, which strain for language to describe Garland's exquisite theatrical instincts, her stamina, vitality and trembling tension, her operatic emotional depth and dynamic range. Like Puccini's Tosca, she lived for art. She was a creature of extremes, greedy, sensual and demanding, gluttonous for pleasure and pain. Her personal appearances were extravagant and, as one critic put it, "orgiastic," like tumultuous pagan festivals.</p><p>Psychology is not Mr. Shipman's forte, and he does little to explain Garland's hostility to her mother or her violently unstable union with Sid Luft and competitiveness with her own daughters. But his book admirably demonstrates the intricate interconnection of commerce and art in Hollywood. We get the grit of management, agents, contracts, bookings and ticket sales. And Mr. Shipman implicitly recognizes the link between genius and criminality. The great stars are sacred monsters, amoral vampires who drain those around them to feed the world. Judy Garland the person was a martyr to Judy Garland the artist, a supernormal being who destroyed as she created.</p><p>Photo: Judy Garland backstage after a performance in 1962.
