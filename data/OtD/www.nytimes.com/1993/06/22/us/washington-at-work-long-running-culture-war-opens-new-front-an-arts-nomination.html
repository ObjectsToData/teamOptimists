It is bitter, long-running and intense, and Sheldon Hackney has found himself in the thick of it.   Mr. Hackney, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, was nominated by President Clinton last week to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. On paper, his confirmation would seem routine, even preordained: A career marked by steady advancement in higher education; important and vocal friends from Mike Wallace, the journalist, to C. Vann Woodward, the historian; and intriguing Southern roots. His in-laws, Virginia and Clifford Durr, were renowned Alabama liberals who helped bail out Rosa Parks. His wife, Lucy Durr Hackney, is a children's advocate and a friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton.">

It is bitter, long-running and intense, and Sheldon Hackney has found himself in the thick of it.</p><p>Mr. Hackney, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, was nominated by President Clinton last week to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. On paper, his confirmation would seem routine, even preordained: A career marked by steady advancement in higher education; important and vocal friends from Mike Wallace, the journalist, to C.

His wife, Lucy Durr Hackney, is a children's advocate and a friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>But Mr. Hackney has also become, much to his dismay, a symbol of political correctness on America's college campuses, an exemplar of a liberal orthodoxy that critics assert has hampered free speech and chewed up numerous innocents along the way.</p><p>Chief among the innocents, these critics contend, is Eden Jacobowitz, a Penn freshman from Lawrence, L.I., who was pursued on racial harassment charges at the university after simply shouting, he insisted throughout the case, "Shut up, you water buffalo!" to a group of noisy black students outside his dormitory one night.

                    <p>Mr. Jacobowitz, who was born in Israel, said the remark had no racial significance, arguing that he was reaching for the word "behayma," Hebrew for "water oxen" or, in slang, "foolish person." His case prompted scores of newspaper columns and editorials, many of them demanding to know why Mr. Hackney and the university's administrators would let such a case go so far, so long.</p><p>The case was dropped in May, with the black students contending that publicity prevented them from getting a fair hearing; Mr. Jacobowitz said that he too was dissatisfied with the process and the outcome.</p><p>Mr. Hackney received even stronger criticism for his response in April when 14,000 copies of the student newspaper were seized by a group of black students protesting a conservative columnist and what they asserted was institutional racism. The students accused of seizing the newspapers face disciplinary proceedings next fall, a university spokeswoman said.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Hackney declared that "two important university values, diversity and open expression, seem to be in conflict." His allies said that the comments were taken out of context and that he emphasized the university's commitment to free speech. But the statement spoke volumes about the colliding world views of this debate.</p><p>What is at stake, to be sure, is not a major piece of Federal turf. But the National Endowment for the Humanities, with a budget of more than $170 million, is a substantial source of grants for the academic world. It has also proven to be a bully pulpit for past chairmen like William J. Bennett and Lynne V. Cheney, who served during the Reagan and Bush Administrations.</p><p>Moreover, the Hackney nomination does not come in a political vacuum.  Still wounded by the failed nomination of Lani Guinier, a law professor also from Penn, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, the Clinton Administration is intent on minimizing controversy around any nomination at the moment. A Positive Record Detailed</p><p>Mr. Hackney's allies present the 59-year-old educator as a reasonable, tolerant man who helped turn his Ivy League university into a far more diverse environment, noting that undergraduate minority enrollment rose to 30 percent from 13 percent in his 12 years as president. He may be cautious, they say, but he successfully balanced all the competing cultures, sensitivities, needs and demands of a modern university, which is not an easy task.</p><p>"He's a Southerner, a moderate guy, not an ideologue at all," said William H. Gray 3d, head of the United Negro College Fund and former majority whip of the House who represented a district in Philadelphia.</p><p>Mr. Hackney's conservative critics counter that he simply toes the politically correct, or P.C., line, a phrase often used to refer to "correct" liberal attitudes, particularly regarding women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals. In recent years, that line of attack has become a frequent one, with critics asserting that many college campuses now enforce those attitudes to such an extent that freedom of speech is trampled upon.</p><p>"We do have concerns about what appears to be a chilling atmosphere on a lot of university campuses," said Gary Bauer, a former Reagan adviser who now heads the conservative Family Research Council, "and our fear is that he will bring the same philosophy to his work at the humanities." Uncomfortable Allies</p><p>Not all the opposition to Mr. Hackney comes from the right. Nat Hentoff, the columnist and First Amendment specialist, argues: "When it's trendy or P.C., he'll give the free-speech line. But if it's the water buffalo man, he's not interested."</p><p>Even some of Mr. Hackney's allies seem uncomfortable with the university's speech policies and enforcement procedures. Senator Harris Wofford, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is Mr. Hackney's patron on Capitol Hill and a former university president himself, said, "I think the old ways of deans and fellow students straightening out people is better than these elaborate procedures and codes."</p><p>Many conservatives would revel in turning the Hackney nomination into a debate over political correctness, which has yet to become a mainstream issue. But Mr. Hackney, who declined a request for an interview, was making the rounds in the Senate last week, trying to defuse the issue before his confirmation hearing next Friday, in the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.</p><p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a conservative Republican from Utah who is on that committee, said after a meeting with Mr. Hackney, "President Hackney made a pretty good case that he is against political correctness." 'Political Hogwash'</p><p>William Kristol, a conservative strategist who was an adviser to Vice President Dan Quayle and who once taught at Penn, said: "It's one thing to say, 'Of course I don't believe in political correctness.' It's another to defend a student or faculty member under pressure because they've said something politically incorrect."</p><p>Mr. Gray counters that any charge of Mr. Hackney's being insufficiently solicitious of free speech "is absolutely right-wing political hogwash."</p><p>Mr. Hackney's candidacy is vastly strengthened, his friends say, by his academic resume. Before joining Penn, he was president of Tulane University and provost of Princeton University. He is also a prize-winning historian of the American South.</p><p>Mr. Bennett, the conservative who was President Ronald Reagan's humanities chairman, said: "My guess is someone like Hackney will be confirmed. He's in the academic mainstream; the problem is I think that mainstream is sullied water."</p><p>As for what Mr. Hackney thinks of the two incidents that tinged his past year at Penn, he told alumni and others in a recent letter that the university had no choice but to let due process run its course. He added, however, that it clearly was time to review those procedures.</p><p>"The fact that Penn's policies have had unintended or unsatisfactory outcomes will be addressed rationally and carefully," he wrote, although he acknowledged the obvious: "These are painful and emotional issues."</p><p>Photo: Sheldon Hackney, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, at home in Philadelphia.
