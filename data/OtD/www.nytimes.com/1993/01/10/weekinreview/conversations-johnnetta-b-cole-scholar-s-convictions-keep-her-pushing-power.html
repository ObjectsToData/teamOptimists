    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  JOHNNETTA B. COLE believes in the power of words at a time when many have given up on them. A talker by trade and conviction, she is, as usual, aiming her words at several audiences at once -- the young black women she leads as president of Spelman College, other blacks, whites and anyone else she can entice to listen. She is talking against a tide of public sentiment that says discussions about race are dangerous and futile, too nerve-racking for whites and too frustrating for blacks.   &quot;How do we get under each others' skins?&quot; she asked, warming up, her voice rising and her words racing. &quot;I hate to be ordinary, but I don't know anything other than education that has worked to create that something called human empathy. If I cannot through human intelligence come to say, 'My God, what must it be like to be in that condition?' what hope is there for the human race?&quot;">

A talker by trade and conviction, she is, as usual, aiming her words at several audiences at once -- the young black women she leads as president of Spelman College, other blacks, whites and anyone else she can entice to listen. She is talking against a tide of public sentiment that says discussions about race are dangerous and futile, too nerve-racking for whites and too frustrating for blacks.   "How do we get under each others' skins?" she asked, warming up, her voice rising and her words racing. "I hate to be ordinary, but I don't know anything other than education that has worked to create that something called human empathy. If I cannot through human intelligence come to say, 'My God, what must it be like to be in that condition?' what hope is there for the human race?""></div>

She is talking against a tide of public sentiment that says discussions about race are dangerous and futile, too nerve-racking for whites and too frustrating for blacks.</p><p>"How do we get under each others' skins?" she asked, warming up, her voice rising and her words racing. "I hate to be ordinary, but I don't know anything other than education that has worked to create that something called human empathy. If I cannot through human intelligence come to say, 'My God, what must it be like to be in that condition?' what hope is there for the human race?"</p><p>That is why she hates the sweat shirts at Spelman and around the country: "It's a black thing. You wouldn't understand." Her choice of words would be: "It's a black thing. You must try to understand."</p><p>Her conviction that people can try to understand has been tested lately as she has come under attack from Jewish groups and conservatives as well as centrist Democrats for her contacts with pro-Palestinian and pro-Cuban organizations. As the head of a Clinton transition team on education, labor, the arts and humanities, Dr. Cole was often mentioned as a candidate for Secretary of Education. But after several critical newspaper articles, Clinton officials quietly told reporters that she would have no say in Administration policy and would not receive a top Administration position.

                    <p>The Forward, a Jewish weekly, reported that Dr. Cole had been a member of the national committee of the Venceremos Brigades, a group that sponsored sugar cane-cutting expeditions to Cuba but one the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains is connected to Cuban intelligence forces. Dr. Cole was also listed as a member of the executive board of the U.S. Peace Council in a program published for its 1983 conference. The group is pro-Palestinian and the F.B.I. considers its parent organization, the World Peace Council, a Soviet front. Dr. Cole said she was never a member of the council, but wrote for the group.</p><p>Dr. Cole, who is 56, said she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Education and was not shut out from policy discussions because the charges involved foreign policy and she was working on domestic issues.</p><p>"It's been difficult," she said. "There's no other word to say. It's been difficult on a number of counts. I don't have anything to hide. The board at Spelman is fully aware of the complexity of my background. The image painted of me is just so antithetical to who I see when I look at myself."</p><p>In fact, some consider Dr. Cole staid, practically a pillar of the establishment. Her mother's relatives were prominent black citizens of Jacksonville, Fla.; her grandfather founded a black life insurance company, and the local black library and YWCA were named for him. She serves on the board of Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and is a founding director of President Bush's Points of Light Foundation. Although her nickname at Spelman is a folksy "Sister Prez," she is very much madam president.</p><p>Dr. Cole, however, is used to standing up for unpalatable opinions -- on sexism, racism, bigotry among whites and among blacks, self-help and political apathy, to name a few. She disagrees with President-elect Bill Clinton and current American foreign policy on the matter of isolating Cuba, a country she has studied as an anthropologist whose work focused on the experience of blacks and women in the Caribbean, Africa and the United States.</p><p>"I think I talk about the complexity of my own background," she said, "what it means to grow up in the intensity of the Jim Crow South, and to have racism and sexism as constant questions, and therefore to begin to look for answers sometimes in places far away from my own nation."</p><p>She is holding forth on more of these opinions in her new book, "Conversations: Straight Talk With America's Sister President" (Doubleday), which is an exhortation to black women for political and social commitment. In describing the stark conditions of many blacks and women, she blames racism, sexism and government neglect. But she also talks about the breakdown of community ties and the need for self-help.</p><p>"Any people who assumes all will be done for them is a people disconnected from their own selves," she said. "There seems to be little relief organized internal to our own community. I do talk in my book about what it meant to me to have a community. On that block I couldn't cut up because older folk would get after me. But these older folk are behind closed doors scared to death an angry youth will come and beat on them."</p><p>She knows that many blacks are uneasy when she says something that could be construed as critical; she is uneasy herself. "I know: 'Don't wash your dirty laundry in front of these people,' " she says. "If we don't talk about our differences, how in the world will we ever sort them out? The problem is there is such a fear that these conversations will be used against us." Other Cultures</p><p>Her solution, naturally enough for an educator and anthropologist, is to teach Americans about the perspectives of other cultures and to insist that any public airing of these issues include social and historical background. Take, for example, tensions blacks have with Koreans and Jews. "I am not going to remain silent about African-American name-calling against Korean-Americans, or any African-American who uses expressions I think really are anti-Semitic," she said. "But I'm going to always insist that we put those comments and our analysis of them in a full context, to say: 'Where could this have come from? Why could someone hold these views? And most importantly, where did we learn it from?' "</p><p>Blacks resent Koreans, she said, not only because theirs are practically the only stores in inner cities, but also because whites tend to throw Korean success in blacks' faces.</p><p>"We have been told that Asian-Americans are the model minority," Dr. Cole said. "Their kids are smart, their families stick together, save and get ahead. We've already had built into our heads a kind of -- 'Why should I like these people? They are getting ahead and I'm not.' "</p><p>She is not going to condone such attitudes, but she is not going to call blacks racist, either. Racism, she says, implies having the institutional and political power to enforce one's beliefs -- an opinion that could make some whites as uneasy as her other pronouncements might trouble some blacks.</p><p>"I would stick to that fundamental distinction of the ability to put one's attitudes into real action, to have power over people's lives," she said.</p><p>Dr. Cole offers no pat answers. Indeed, at the end of her book, she asks her readers to complete the book themselves, to come up with concrete actions they can perform that will right some of the wrongs she discusses.</p><p>Now, at the end of a different conversation, she releases her lock on her interviewer's eyes, and for the moment, with much left unsaid, the talking stops.</p><p>Photo: Johnnetta B.
