                    <p>This season, two of George Bernard Shaw's plays will open on Broadway within weeks of each other -- not a common phenomenon. A revival of "St. Joan" by the National Actors Theater opens this afternoon at the Lyceum Theater, directed by Michael Langham and starring Maryann Plunkett. In March, the Roundabout Theater Company will mount Shaw's romance "Candida," directed by Gloria Muzio, with Mary Steenburgen in the title role. In this article, the playwright A. R. Gurney, who has two new plays opening this spring, "The Fourth Wall" in Chicago and "Later Life" at Playwrights Horizons in New York, reminisces about the Shaw he has known for a lifetime.</p><p>Several months ago, I received a letter from a professor in Virginia who pointed out that "1992 marks the 100th anniversary of Bernard Shaw's first play, 'Widowers' Houses.' " This means, he said, that we are celebrating "the 100th anniversary of modern drama in the English language." The professor was organizing a conference and planned to present a paper on Shaw's effect on American drama. He wondered if I had any thoughts on the subject. "As an educated American," he wrote almost pleadingly, "you must be familiar with Shaw." When I was a teacher, did I ever teach him? As a playwright, was I at all influenced by him? Did I have anything special I'd like to say about him now?</p><p>The letter reminded me how much Shaw and his plays once permeated my consciousness, and how little I have thought about him in the last 10 or 15 years. He was, of course, a dominant literary figure during the first half of the century, receiving the Nobel Prize at the peak of his career in 1925. Still alive and writing when I was a child, he was invoked and referred to simply by his initials: G. B. S., like F. D. R. or M-G-M. I recall hearing him discussed at the dinner table with some irritation by my father, and with considerable appreciation by my mother. I also remember seeing him in a Movietone newsreel, clowning for the camera in front of his cottage at Ayot St. Lawrence in England on one of his birthdays -- a spry old man with a scruffy beard, an Irish accent and a twinkle in his eye. He died in 1950, when I was in college.</p><p>By then I had already read several of his works and was fast becoming a convert. To a 20-year-old, he seemed startlingly fresh and exciting, as well as something of a wise guy, which was right down my alley. I had collaborated in writing two student musical revues, and had become so entranced with Shaw that I proposed to the head of the drama department that for my senior thesis I write and run the whole show, which would be a musical version of "Pygmalion." The idea was summarily rejected as unworkable, so I ended up doing a study of "The Winter's Tale." But Shaw stayed in my blood.</p>                </div>

                    <p>His plays were being produced all over the place in those days. His bright, quirky wit and passionate intelligence seemed to cut through the smug, self-congratulatory attitudes of the postwar 50's, challenging and engaging audiences in just the way he would have liked. I myself was bowled over by two particular productions: the first, "St. Joan" in 1951 with Uta Hagen, at City Center in New York, was simply the most stupendous thing I had ever seen. All I wanted in the world was to write a play like that -- strong, funny and moving, all at the same time, with a gutsy heroine dying defiantly for a brave cause, while everyone else told us what it meant for European History.</p><p>The other production that hit me where I lived was a touring company of "Don Juan in Hell" that same year. This was the third act of "Man and Superman," performed by Charles Boyer, Agnes Moorehead, Charles Laughton and Cedric Hardwicke, who all stood at music stands in elegant evening clothes, half reading, half reciting their sumptuous parts. I was entranced by the language and the ideas, and by the thought that you didn't have to have scenery or even much of a plot to hold an audience spellbound.</p><p>Shaw was well served then. It seemed that a year didn't go by without some all-star production of one of his plays ("Heartbreak House," "Major Barbara") sailing majestically into New York, with actors like Laughton, Maurice Evans, John Gielgud and Pamela Brown tossing his dialogue around the infield. "My Fair Lady" musicalized and popularized him, and the LP chattered continually in the background of parties. A Shaw festival sprang up at Niagara-on-the-Lake, near my hometown, Buffalo, and, after I saw my parents, I could see Jessica Tandy or Zoe Caldwell or Douglas Rain doing the great parts to a turn.</p><p>Even the movies did Shaw justice. Not only were the classic English films of "Pygmalion" and "Major Barbara" regularly revived in art houses and libraries, but now there was "Caesar and Cleopatra," with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains, a refreshing antidote to the sodden historical extravaganzas it seemed to parody. Shaw was a little too subversive for Hollywood, but still one studio managed to release an independent version of "The Devil's Disciple," with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, and Laurence Olivier cleaning up as Burgoyne. There was even a production of "Androcles and the Lion," with Jean Simmons -- or someone who should have been Jean Simmons -- playing a gorgeously doomed Christian.</p>                </div>
