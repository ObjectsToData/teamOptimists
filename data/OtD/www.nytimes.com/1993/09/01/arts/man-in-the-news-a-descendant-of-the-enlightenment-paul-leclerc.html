The book was a slim one, Voltaire's &quot;Candide,&quot; and it came into his life through an unusual messenger, a Jesuit priest who taught at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass.   &quot;He read excerpts from the episode in which Candide and Cacambo fled the Jesuits, putting on the robes of the Jesuits as a disguise,&quot; said Mr. LeClerc. &quot;They are caught and put in a cauldron of boiling water by savages, who say, 'Let's eat some Jesuit.' I thought that was extraordinarily clever as a text.&quot;">

"He read excerpts from the episode in which Candide and Cacambo fled the Jesuits, putting on the robes of the Jesuits as a disguise," said Mr. LeClerc.

"They are caught and put in a cauldron of boiling water by savages, who say, 'Let's eat some Jesuit.' I thought that was extraordinarily clever as a text."</p><p>In the days before Vatican II, the works of Voltaire were on the church's list of forbidden books. Mr. LeClerc wrote to the bishop of Worcester and asked permission to read "Candide," as well as "Madame Bovary," by Flaubert and "The Red and the Black," by Stendhal. Permission was granted, and a scholarly career was born.</p><p>"I've often wondered what might have happened had I had a different French instructor, had I not gone to class that day, or if he had read a different book," Mr. LeClerc said, musingly.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But "Candide" it was. Mr. LeClerc took his bachelor's degree in biology, but, after studying for a year at the Sorbonne, he enrolled as a student of French literature at Columbia, where he wrote his master's thesis and his doctoral dissertation on Voltaire.</p><p>The romance continues to this day. Mr. LeClerc recently completed a scholarly edition of the author's tragedy "Rome Saved" for the definitive edition of Voltaire, in more than 100 volumes, that is currently being prepared by the Voltaire Foundation-Taylor Institute at Oxford University.</p><p>As Mr. LeClerc tells it, the example of Voltaire and the writers of the French Enlightenment will guide his work at the library. "The entire project of the Encyclopedia, to which Diderot and others contributed, was to give people access to information," he said. "The idea was to put all information known to humanity into book form, and put the books in the hands of people."</p><p>Just like the library. "We're part and parcel of the same process," he said. "We're in the business of enfranchising people by giving them free information."</p><p>For a man with a populist mission, the 52-year-old Mr. LeClerc cuts a somewhat incongruous figure. Tall and lean, he makes a crisp apperance in a well-cut suit and silver cufflinks in his French cuffs. He speaks, quietly and intently, with the rigor and fluency that bespeak a Jesuit education further polished by continued, constant exposure to the French intellectual tradition. For New Yorkers who have grown used to library presidents with the press-the-flesh instincts of a politician, Mr. LeClerc may take getting used to.</p><p>"He's not a backslapper, he's not a bubbly, ebullient personality, and in certain ways you have to work with him to get to his sense of humor, the fact that he does have passions," said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political science and the chairman of the college senate at Hunter College. "He's a very controlled person, and he doesn't like to show anger, but when his moral sense is offended, he shows it."</p><p>The moral sense was instilled early, in the parochial schools of Queens. Mr. LeClerc was born in Lebanon, N.H., but he grew up in Bayside, where his father, a manager with the National Biscuit Company, was transferred. His parents were both of French Canadian descent, and French was spoken at home. Up Through the Ranks</p><p>From 1966 until 1984, Mr. LeClerc taught French at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. In 1980, he married Judith Ginsberg, now the executive director of the Covenant Foundation. (They have a 6-year-old son, whose name they do not divulge.) At Union College, Mr. LeClerc rose through the ranks to receive tenure and become head of the college's humanities division. Somewhere along the way, he said casually, "I decided I'd like to be a college president."</p><p>The road to the presidency began in the administative machinery of the City University of New York, where he began working in 1984.</p><p>"I wanted to get back to New York," he said, "and specifically to become involved in something that was becoming more important to me, what might be called the education of the new America."</p><p>Of his time in the central office of City University, Mr. LeClerc said: "I learned a prodigious amount about administration and about how to get things done in New York."</p><p>In 1988, he was appointed president of Hunter College, and in his first address to the faculty he spelled out some of the ideas he had in mind when he talked about the education of the new America.</p><p>"I made it clear that we had to be ahead of the times in addressing issues of multiculturalism," he said. "I called for changes in the curriculum that would reflect the accomplishments of men and women throughout the world." Teaching Global Citizens</p><p>It took four years, considerable arm-twisting and endless debate to put changes in place that some faculty members initially regarded as impelled by feel-good rhetoric and intellectual mush. With time, opinions changed.</p><p>"He kept saying, this has to be something that is intellectually defensible," said Mr. Sherrill. "For him this was a matter of raising intellectual standards, by requiring that students learn more."</p><p>Mr. LeClerc speaks fervently on the issue, which he describes, in its simplest terms, as the responsibility to educate global citizens in a global world. "I know it sounds like a cliche," he said. "But people have to be aware of how the world works."</p>                </div>
