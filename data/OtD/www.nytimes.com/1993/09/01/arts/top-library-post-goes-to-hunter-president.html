The announcement was made yesterday afternoon by Marshall Rose, the chairman of the library. Mr. LeClerc, 52, a Voltaire scholar and professor of French, will take over as head of the library on Jan. 1, one year and one day after his predecessor, Timothy S. Healy, fell dead of a heart attack at Newark International Airport.   &quot;The members of the search committee came to a unanimous conclusion, after many meetings with Paul, that the sum of his parts was equal to the mission of the library that lies ahead of us,&quot; said Mr. Rose. The committee began its work in February, he said, looking at a field of more than 100 candidates.">

Both men were close to being academic celebrities and, once in New York, they maintained a high level of visibility as they campaigned relentlessly to raise money for the library and broadcast its mission to the public and to elected officials.</p><p>Mr. LeClerc, interviewed at Mr. Rose's office in Manhattan, said that the offer to become president of the library was "irresistible."

                    <p>"I've not been a candidate for any post anywhere in the country," he said, "but when the library came to me and asked if I'd consider the position, it was a quick and easy decision. This is one of the world's great libraries, one I've been close to all my life, first as a kid growing up in Queens, then as a student at Columbia, and later as a teacher and scholar."</p><p>Mr. LeClerc, who became Hunter's president in 1988 after four years as administrator with the City University of New York, inherits an unusual hybrid. Although many New Yorkers think it belongs to the city, the library is a private nonprofit institution. With 38 million books, manuscripts and recordings, it is the second-largest research library in the United States, after the Library of Congress, serving scholars and researchers from around the world.</p><p>But it is also a far-flung lending library, serving schoolchildren and ordinary citizens through 82 branch libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. (Queens and Brooklyn operate independent library systems.) Last year, 8.4 million people visited the branches and the three research centers: the Central Research Library at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, the Schomburg Center for Black Culture, at Malcolm X Boulevard at 135th Street. The library has an operating budget this year of $146 million, and a staff of 3,000.</p><p>Mr. LeClerc takes over at a hopeful time for the library, which has fought its way back in the last decade from decrepitude, penury and decline to a state of financial well-being that is the envy of many other cultural institutions in the city.  A Fourth Research Center</p><p>Today, with the library approaching its centenary year in 1995, it is preparing to open a fourth research center, the $100 million Science, Business and Industry Library, on seven floors in the old B. Altman department store. The new center, known by the acronymn SIBL (pronounced Sibyl), is scheduled to open in fall 1995.</p><p>Next year, all the branches and the research libraries will be part of a single computerized catalogue, which means that a user on, say, Staten Island could locate a book anywhere in the library system.</p><p>And late this month, all branches of the system will begin the transition to a six-day week. The process will be completed in June.</p><p>"The library has come a long way," said Vartan Gregorian, the president of Brown University and the library's president from 1981 to 1992. "The main thing is to sustain the momentum." Mr. Gregorian described the library as having entered "a quiet phase of consolidation, reflection and planning."</p><p>Mr. LeClerc said that his first task was simply to learn. "I think of the Queen Mary," he said. "When it got a new captain, the officers understood that his first order of business was to keep the ship running back and forth across the Atlantic, not to paint it blue or turn it inside out."</p><p>In broad terms, Mr. LeClerc defined his mission as carrying out the two-year strategic plan adopted in April 1992 by the board, which calls for several programs put in place by Mr. Healy to be carried through to completion, including SIBL and the six-day schedule, as well as another program known by its initials, the Connecting Libraries and Schools Project, or Clasp. Linking Teachers and Librarians</p><p>Clasp, now in its third year, is an orientation program that puts teachers together with their local librarian. One goal is to insure that all students have a library card and know how to use it. Another is to allow teachers to plan homework asignments that make efficient use of library materials. The program now embraces 23 branch libraries.</p>                </div>
