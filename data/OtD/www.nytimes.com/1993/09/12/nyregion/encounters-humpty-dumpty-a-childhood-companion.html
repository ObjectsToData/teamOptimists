Or is it the most natural thing in the world?   Very much a thinker in terms of life's stages, the 58-year-old Jerry Gargiulo has a life that divides into three distinct stages: the first, a 10-year period as a Carmelite monk, during which he discovered East Hampton, when he was sent there for summers to contemplate; the second, the time of his psychoanalytic training and practice, culminating in his taking an active role in the association's Psychoanalytic Training Institute; and the third, which he moves toward even while he is still immersed in the second, in which he returns to the initial contemplation in a new way, as a poet and looker, and in which he begins his memoir, a writing of psychoanalytic theory and experience, told out of the closeness to childhood and nature that returning to eastern Long Island evokes.">

Very much a thinker in terms of life's stages, the 58-year-old Jerry Gargiulo has a life that divides into three distinct stages: the first, a 10-year period as a Carmelite monk, during which he discovered East Hampton, when he was sent there for summers to contemplate; the second, the time of his psychoanalytic training and practice, culminating in his taking an active role in the association's Psychoanalytic Training Institute; and the third, which he moves toward even while he is still immersed in the second, in which he returns to the initial contemplation in a new way, as a poet and looker, and in which he begins his memoir, a writing of psychoanalytic theory and experience, told out of the closeness to childhood and nature that returning to eastern Long Island evokes."></div>

As we sit talking in front of his house in the Northwest Woods, our discussion moves from Winnicott and his theories to Jerry's discovery of the Impressionist painters, the importance of van Gogh's life story to him, to the ways in which strength and vulnerability do not have to be in opposition but may augment each other. As we talk of the subtle differences between those who felt annihilated as children and those who felt even inadequately mirrored, but not totally obliterated, I am thinking of the child who didn't learn to read until he was 11 or 12 years old because he was too busy studying the patterns of light on the leaves as they fell on the sidewalks, and the play of the light and the shadows. Then I think of the very fast man, who works fast, who has never, since I have known him, been able not to add on a new project into his already overcrowded life, or refuse a new role or directorship, who even as he talks, will be planning to eliminate a front deck or to fill in a window where he is wishing for a painting or a bookshelf instead, to undo what is already there to replace it with something a bit more to his own fancy, who all the while is trying to slow himself down, and who, in his own way, is a master in slowness and stillness and listening, deep peace.</p><p>I wouldn't know Jerry Gargiulo at all except for the coincidence that during his Carmelite years someone had given a large white house in East Hampton to 20 or so monks in training, so that they might come for a few weeks each summer and contemplate by the sea. When I asked him why particularly had this land held him, he thought for a moment and then explained that there was some peculiar quality in the way that the earth and the sky touched each other, absolutely, in the absolute flatness that brought him in contact with something he needed to know.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Perhaps it is not coincidental that during the years of his renting first one house, then another, in this area, while fantasizing about gradually leaving Greenwich, Conn., where most of his practice takes place, he would look only at houses very close to the sea, where the flatness of earth and of sky correspond to the vision he told me about, yet in the end he would come to the woods, where now, once again as we sit there, the leaves cast their shadows. It is the fifth, maybe even the sixth of those days of unrelenting over-100-degree heat we will all remember, but for a moment we do not feel it as we talk about vulnerability, the need to fix self and fix people, and Humpty. 'The Constant Struggle'</p><p>"Humpty doesn't see from a level," Jerry says, as over the months of his writing his memoir it has become the most natural thing in the world to switch from talk of Winnicott or psychoanalytic theory to Humpty. "High means the constant struggle to see what's going on. Humpty on the ground is our constant vulnerability."</p><p>And I, who am constantly thinking about the meaning of objects, think, yes, how in the high-ceilinged bedroom upstairs there is a 100-year-old bamboo ladder from China, its rungs somewhat irregularly placed and its uprights at a slightly irregular angle. It is the single object that has been carried around, from one rented house in the East Hampton area to another, even while all books and all cherished possessions were left back in Greenwich, in the house rapidly becoming "no longer home." There are also two gigantic old English and Irish chests that seem to have come out of some fairy tale kingdom where enclosure and supernatural largeness evoke somehow both fantasies of impossibility and hearth, making me think of Bachelard's "Poetics of Space" and the image of a child climbing in.</p><p>We have talked for a long time, Jerry and I, about the meaning of climbing up on a ladder in order to see, or sitting, like Humpty, upon a high wall, even as we have talked about his feeling that therapy can be done successfully only in a place where you experience yourself on level ground with your patient, how one cannot decide, or deign from on high, to establish the level, but must find it slowly, existentially through a lifetime.</p>                </div>
