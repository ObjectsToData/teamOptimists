The reward for his assassin is more than $2 million.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie appeared before an audience of nearly 600 that had assembled in a lecture hall for what had been billed, for the purposes of security, as a reading by Ms. Sontag. But instead of reading from her work, Ms. Sontag introduced "one of the great writers of our time," Salman Rushdie.</p><p>"There are assassins everywhere seeking Salman Rushdie," she said. "Why was he sentenced to death? Because he wrote a novel."</p>                </div>

                    <p>But on this night Mr. Rushdie was among friends and readers; they rose and applauded when, smiling shyly and peering over his wire-rimmed glasses, he walked onto the stage. 'I Need Your Help'</p><p>"I'm afraid I need your help because the only weapon that I have is public opinion," he said. "In the end, the governments of the democratic world will act in this matter only if they believe it's a matter of sufficient interest to their own citizens and voters. They won't do it for me; they might do it for you."</p><p>M.I.T. became the first university to honor Mr. Rushdie. Alan Lightman, head of the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies, who spoke briefly tonight, said Mr. Rushdie hoped the recognition would help his campaign to get more support for his cause from Western governments. Mr. Rushdie is expected to meet with White House officials on Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie lives by running, from safe house to safe house. His marriage, to the American novelist Marianne Wiggins, has ended. He has lost the opportunity to watch his son, Zafar, now 15, grow up. But Mr. Rushdie has refused to be silenced.</p><p>He remains a writer. While in hiding he has produced one novel and is at work on another.</p><p>And for nearly an hour tonight Mr. Rushdie read. He chose, not "Satanic Verses," but an earlier novel, "Midnight's Children." He said, "Give 'The Satanic Verses' a rest." Lively Presentation</p><p>Gesturing with his hands, and using different voices and accents, Mr. Rushdie became his characters. The audience was delighted.</p><p>In December 1991, Mr. Rushdie electrified an audience that had gathered at Columbia University for a salute to the First Amendment and Justice William J. Brennan Jr.</p><p>Mr. Rushdie has lived in hiding under heavy police protection since Feb. 14, 1989. President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said last February that because Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989, the death sentence could never be lifted.</p><p>But Mr. Rushdie has continued to speak. He has been venturing into public more and more, appearing unannounced at conventions on free speech and human rights, meeting with government officials and even giving readings at bookstores. Wherever he goes, his message is the same: If Iran can force a single author into silence, then freedom of expression is threatened everywhere.</p><p>Only a handful of people knew that Mr. Rushdie would appear tonight. At 8 P.M., moments before Ms. Sontag was introduced, the audience was told that no one would be allowed in or out of the room for the next 90 minutes. A murmur arose: What was going on?</p><p>The risks are enormous, and not just for Mr. Rushdie. In July, 1991, his Japanese translator was fatally stabbed at the university near Tokyo where he taught. On almost the same day, his Italian translator survived a stabbing in his apartment near Milan.</p><p>In October, another assassination attempt was made upon Mr. Rushdie's Norwegian publisher.</p><p>Ms. Sontag said that assassins were trying to kill "his publishers, translators, booksellers, agents and, presumably, by extension, his readers."</p><p>Photo: "I'm afraid I need your help because the only weapon that I have is public opinion," said Salman Rushdie, the author of "The Satanic Verses," who emerged last night at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He waved after an introduction by Mark S. Wrigton, left, provost at M.I.T. (Evan Richman for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
