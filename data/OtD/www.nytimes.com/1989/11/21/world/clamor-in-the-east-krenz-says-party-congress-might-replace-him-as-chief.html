                    <p>Egon Krenz, the East German leader, has held out the possibility that he might be replaced next month as Communist Party General Secretary while retaining his other powerful posts. His remarks came as talk of a possible party split and even of the party's dissolution has spread through the Communist ranks.</p><p>In an interview on Sunday night with the official East German television, Mr. Krenz said he did not rule out being replaced as General Secretary at a special party congress planned for next month. ''That is a decision of the party,'' he said. ''I have always abided by the decisions of my party.''</p><p>Over the last week, Mr. Krenz's fourth as party chief, there has been talk from the grass roots to higher levels of the Communist Party that Mr. Krenz holds too many jobs. He was simultaneously named party General Secretary, head of state and head of the National Defense Council on Oct. 18, when he replaced Erich Honecker. Seems to Prefer Other Jobs</p><p>In making his statement, Mr. Krenz appears to be acknowledging the weakened position of the party and the clamor within its ranks and at the grass roots for greater power sharing.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The exodus of East Germans to the West and the continuing protests against the Communist Government may also suggest to Mr. Krenz that the title of party chief is more trouble than it is worth. If he dropped any of his titles, Mr. Krenz would be the first East German chief not to hold all the posts since the days of Walter Ulbricht.</p><p>Mr. Krenz seemed to be saying that if he had to choose, he would prefer to remain head of state and chairman of the State Council than struggle to stay at the helm of the party.</p><p>On Sunday, the 52-year-old leader moved out of his villa in the heavily guarded compound that has been used by senior party officials for the last 25 years at Wandlitz, a few miles north of Berlin, and into a bungalow in the East Berlin borough of Pankow.</p><p>The Communist youth paper Junge Welt today carried a photograph of the bungalow, which sits behind a simple white chain-link fence, under the headline, ''What We Always Wanted to Know: Where Egon Krenz Lives.'' Another newspaper carried a photograph of Mr. Krenz holding his granddaughter, Katharina, on his knee inside the residence at No. 9 Majakowskiweg.</p><p>He said the rest of his friends in the new Politburo would also soon move out of Wandlitz, leaving it as a settlement for retired senior party officials, including Mr. Honecker. The ruling party has begun to dismantle other privileged compounds in addition to Wandlitz. It was disclosed today that the party was turning over its 33-bed guest house at Frankenhorst, near Schwerin, to the City of Schwerin Hotel. Another guest house at nearby Zippendorf will be made available to other parties besides the Communists. Rumors of U.S. Trip Denied</p><p>In the television interview, Mr. Krenz denied rumors that he had flown secretly to the United States for an operation on his pancreas, saying first that he had not been ill and second that he did not have any American dollars.</p><p>Mr. Krenz went on to say that in his opinion it was not socialism that had collapsed in East Germany but rather ''the Stalinist deformation of socialism.'' He said that from now on the Communist Party would have to fight for its leading role with four other parties that until recently had been mere satellites of the Communists.</p><p>A confidential poll taken last week by the state polling office in Leipzig concluded that if there were free elections now, the Communist Party, which calls itself the Socialist Unity Party, would win only 7 percent of the vote. No other details about the poll were available. The polling institute is often used by the Government to test the public's mood. Mr. Krenz also said it was essential to draft and pass a new election law in Parliament that would permit free elections next year. Discussions Organized</p><p>The party's Central Committee is trying to absorb the great waves of bitterness and sense of betrayal that have swept through party ranks by organizing discussions and providing telephone lines and mailing addresses for members who want to vent their feelings or make proposals for changes.</p><p>Today, Neues Deutschland and Berliner Zeitung, both Communist Party papers, listed three discussions sessions to be held this week at the Central Committee building in downtown East Berlin under the headings ''economic reform,'' ''equality'' and ''can the Socialist Unity Party renew itself?'' They also listed six phone numbers for complaints and proposals.</p><p>Despite those efforts, sentiments for splitting the party or even dissolving it altogether seem to be swelling.</p><p>The possibility of a split was raised on Sunday by Roland Wortzel, the new Communist secretary for Leipzig, in a television discussion. The issue was raised again today by Thomas Falke, head of the party organization, on the official Government radio. 'Have to Get at the Roots'</p><p>''You can't talk it away,'' Dr. Falke said of the danger of a split. ''Now we have to get at the roots, not just tear off the leaves of the party.''</p><p>Two humanities professors at Humboldt University in East Berlin told a party official over the weekend that the best thing would be to dissolve the party, as the Hungarian Communist Party did earlier this fall.</p><p>As the ferment continues, party institutions that seemed rock solid for decades are crumbling. At Neues Deutschland last week, eight top editors were dismissed and seven new editors were brought in, without a formal announcement. The former chief editor, a Honecker loyalist named Herbert Naumann, was replaced by Wolfgang Spickermann, who was until last week a junior editor.</p><p>The general sense of instability, including a sharp rise in smuggling across newly opened border crossings to West Berlin and West Germany, was underlined by a front-page article, headlined ''A Call to Sabotage,'' in the Berliner Zeitung. It described leaflets distributed here last week calling for everyone to turn on all their electrical appliances at the same time to cause a power system breakdown and a blackout throughout East Germany.</p><p>The paper did not report when the protest was to take place, saying only that it was supposed to occur sometime late last week. There was no sign that the reported protest went forward.</p>                </div>
