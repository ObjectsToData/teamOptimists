                    <p>Even before William J. Bennett takes office to lead the Federal effort against illegal drugs, key officials who championed the new post are skeptical that he will acquire sufficient influence to succeed in what many regard as a kind of Mission Impossible.</p><p>William von Raab, the United States Customs Commissioner who campaigned hard for the post himself, said: ''There's a lot of competition that's going to be taking place at the White House. The tugging and pulling on our national agenda is intense.''</p><p>Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat who turned down the job, cautioned that Mr. Bennett was ''going to have trouble with the Defense Department, trouble with the State Department, and maybe trouble with the Justice Department.''</p><p>''He's a sitting duck,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who for eight years pushed to create the job.</p>                </div>

                    <p>While all three say they are hopeful that Mr. Bennett will make a difference, their misgivings are understandable, given his daunting assignment: to try to rein in a drug epidemic that seems beyond the reach of any individual or government. Oval Office Signal Are Mixed</p><p>The real test may not be in the actions of Mr. Bennett, a former teacher and head of the National Endowment for Humanities, but in those of President Bush. Signals from the Oval Office thus far have been mixed.</p><p>On the one hand, Mr. Bush has stated that the drug problem is one of his uppermost concerns, saying in his Inaugural Address, ''Take my word for it: This scourge will stop.'' In his speech before a joint session of Congress he even singled out Mr. Bennett, saying they would work ''shoulder to shoulder'' in a war against drugs ''waged on all fronts.'' On the other hand, the President has not included Mr. Bennett in the Cabinet.</p><p>But several Democrat lawmakers applauded Mr. Bush for moving in the right direction with his fiscal 1990 budget proposal to raise the amount for drug programs from the $5.14 billion recommended by Ronald Reagan to $5.96 billion.</p><p>Mr. Bennett's task is to bring order to a Federal effort that has had little success in combating illegal drugs and has been hampered by turf battles involving three dozen agencies.</p><p>What most people call the ''drug czar'' but officially is the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, was created as part of the bill enacted last year. It requires the director to develop a long-range strategy within 180 days after confirmation, and to execute that strategy. Responsibilities and Power</p><p>In addition, the director would have to certify to Congress that the budget request of each agency dealing with drug policy was adequate. This was intended to give Mr. Bennett some authority in dealing with the Office of Management and Budget. It could also set Mr. Bennett on a collision course with that agency, which consistently slashed budget requests in the Reagan Administration.</p><p>Despite these responsibilities, he will have limited power, assuming he is confirmed after hearings before Mr. Biden's committee.</p><p>Mr. Bush's 1990 budget proposal allocates a mere $12 million for the drug policy office; far from the $115 million for the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, one of dozens of Federal drug programs.</p><p>Mr. Bennett is expected to operate initially with a staff of 40 to 60. His inexperience in narcotics issues will make his choices of deputies responsible for reduction of drug supply and demand, and an associate director to run a state and local division, particularly important.</p><p>The 45-year-old Mr. Bennett is beginning to select his principal deputies, and a name that his advisers mention frequently for one of those jobs is William Lucas, the Republican candidate for Governor in Michigan in 1986, one of the party's best known black local officials.</p><p>More important than staffing or his job description may be the way he defines his own role, and whether his directives and executive orders to agency heads carry the weight of Mr. Bush's backing. Reputation Under Reagan</p><p>As Education Secretary in the Reagan Administration for three years, Mr. Bennett gained a reputation for stirring controversy to make a point. That skill could prove more valuable in his new, more amorphous position.</p><p>''The very thing, in my view, that made him troublesome in education may make him very valuable in this position,'' Mr. Biden said. ''He's never afraid to pick a fight.''</p><p>But lately, the normally high-profile Mr. Bennett, who had asked Mr. Bush to give him the job, has made few public appearances. Last weekend, his aides said, he headed to a hideaway in West Virginia to plow through a thick briefing booklet that describes current Government efforts to fight drugs. Mr. Bennett has been tight-lipped about whether he would concentrate on drug supply, demand or treatment.</p><p>Mark A. R. Kleiman, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said the issue of focus was particularly important since Mr. Bennett has no background in drug matters. ''The big question is his ability to educate himself and his staff quickly on a ferociously complicated set of issues,'' Mr. Kleiman said.</p><p>Mr. Bennett seems to view his role as far different from that of an agency head. ''I think what you will see is unlike at Education, when Bill took over a nothing agency and felt he had to make a splash really fast to get on the map,'' said a White House official who is close to him. ''Now he will try to be visible but less controversial. Early on, he will hold off on dramatic policy changes and initiatives with a lot of symbolic things to fight a sense of fatalism, like meeting with community groups to reassure them we can do something about the problem.''</p><p>Mr. Bennett's vigorous defense of the President's decision not to include him in the Cabinet has done little to silence critics on Capitol Hill, who say it diminishes his stature and could set him up for disputes with an number of Cabinet members: What if the Secretary of State does not want to take ''disruptive'' actions against Colombia to toughen up on the drug trafficking? What if the Defense Secretary does not want to release a fleet of helicopters to patrol the borders? What does the drug chief have to say about the Attorney General's placing drug education officers in the Justice Department's regional offices?</p><p>Even if everything goes smoothly with the agency heads, critics note, a Federal effort to fight drugs is only part of the battle, which should include local jurisdictions.</p><p>As Mayor James A. Van Horn Jr. of Artesia, Calif., put it, ''We not only need a czar, we need a Supreme Allied Commander who's going to give the marching orders.''</p><p>photo of President Bush with William J.
