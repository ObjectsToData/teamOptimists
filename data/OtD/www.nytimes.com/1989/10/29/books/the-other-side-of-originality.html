                    <p>STOLEN WORDS  Forays Into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism.  By Thomas Mallon.  300 pp. New York: Ticknor &amp; Fields. $18.95.</p><p>In Latin, a plagiarius is a kidnapper, literally one who snares another's child or slave in a plaga (net). Until the late 17th century, the English term was ''plagiary''; only then did it acquire an ''ism,'' suggesting a syndrome or habit rather than an individual perpetrator. And only then did plagiarism come to mean the theft, not of any beloved person or thing, but specifically and exclusively of writing.</p><p>The first chapter of Thomas Mallon's ''Stolen Words'' briefly outlines the social and cultural developments that produced this new concept. Before the invention of movable type in the mid-15th century, when all books were manuscripts, plagiarism, in effect, was necessary. Books multiplied only if they were copied; authors could not afford to be jealous of their words, since unless they got stolen they languished unread.</p><p>Well into the 17th century, originality carried no cachet. Shakespeare exemplifies the premodern attitude: he took plots and characters from wherever he pleased, rarely acknowledging sources, and he saw so little sanctity in his own words that anyone could print them who cared to incur the expense - which did not include royalties to Shakespeare.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Even then, however, a few writers prized the attachment of their names to what they wrote, and fought to preserve the link. Mr. Mallon, the author of ''A Book of One's Own: People and Their Diaries,'' cites the ''crazy'' extreme of Thomas Churchyard (1520?-1604), who went beyond jealousy: he ''continued to accuse his rivals of stealing from him and of denying him the authorship of his own works. He alone of all English writers before 1600 takes this position.''</p><p>Following modern practice, Mr. Mallon credits these words to the critic Harold Ogden White. Mr. Mallon's own comments, however, are more illuminating: ''The mania would not have been intelligible even to Churchyard himself if the slow undercurrents of a cultural sea change had not begun to move. A modern world was printing and distributing itself into existence. Literary 'careers' would be 'made,' and writerly goods would get sold, not because they were skillful variants of earlier ones but because they wereJU original.''</p><p>In the 18th century, as the idea of the original author took shape, so did its shadow, plagiarism. The new attitude is summed up by a line Mr. Mallon quotes from Alexander Pope's ''Essay on Criticism'': ''What oft was Thought, but ne'er so well Exprest.'' ''The point is,'' Mr. Mallon adds, ''that while the reader has had the thought or feeling, only the writer has quite been able to put it into words.''</p><p>The notion is full of latent contradictions and procedural difficulties, which the next two centuries explored to the limit. After its first chapter, ''Stolen Words'' abandons the social-historical approach in favor of a more or less chronological series of extended anecdotes, each illustrating one of plagiarism's paradoxes or dead ends.</p><p>Overall, the effect is a bit scrappy, exacerbated by Mr. Mallon's tendency to digress. Sometimes, especially in his narrative of Anita Clay Kornfeld's unsuccessful suit against the television series ''Falcon Crest,'' on the grounds that it plagiarized her 1980 novel, ''Vintage,'' he piles up many more details than the point of the tale warrants. But he writes vivaciously, and is almost never dull. Along the way, he assembles a beguiling portrait of the plagiarist (at least the habitual one) as an oddly plaintive psychopath.</p><p>The star case is that of Jayme Aaron Sokolow, Mr. Mallon's academic instance. Mr. Sokolow seems to be or have been an inveterate, and skillful, cribber of other people's words. When, in the fall of 1981, he came up for tenure in the history department of Texas Tech University, his lengthy list of publications underwent close scrutiny for the first time. After five years on the faculty, he suddenly looked like a fraud.</p><p>The story is too complicated for easy summary; its most striking features are the delicacy with which Mr. Sokolow's colleagues treated him, in the face of irrefutable evidence, and the unabashed self-righteousness of Mr. Sokolow's behavior. Both, according to Mr. Mallon, are typical. Those who uncover plagiarism become paralyzed with embarrassment, letting the culprit escape rather than confronting him. Meanwhile, those who plagiarize freely admit to carelessness (especially, like Mr. Sokolow, to ''sloppy notetaking,'') but always dodge the real issue.</p><p>The result is a sordid mess, in which justice rarely gets done or even clearly identified. Mr. Sokolow left Texas Tech, but he landed a job at the National Endowment for the Humanities. His controversial book was duly published; an errata slip was later sent out, but ''errata'' means ''errors,'' which are not intentional. As for Mr. Sokolow's feelings, we know only that, in his nine-page letter of self-defense to the Texas Tech faculty, he misspelled three words: ''plagerism,'' ''plagerizing'' and ''plagerized.''</p><p>Was he crying for help? Do all plagiarists secretly desire exposure and punishment? Mr. Mallon seems to think so, and I am inclined to agree. The bulk of ''Stolen Words'' amounts to a chatty psychopathology of this distinctly modern form of antisocial behavior. The subject is dismal, but ''Stolen Words'' seldom fails to make it lively, engrossing and provocative.  AN AUTOMATED WRITER</p><p>An interviewer has to ask the author of a book on plagiarism, have you ever plagiarized anything? Thomas Mallon, the author of ''Stolen Words,'' responded firmly in a telephone conversation from his office at Vassar College: ''No, not intentionally. I might have used the odd phrase or metaphor or notion.'' But he is a firm subscriber to the ''general rule for writers: if you think you should attribute it, then attribute it. It's much like when I was growing up a Catholic on Long Island and we were taught that if you thought you had committed a sin, you should confess it.''</p><p>Mr. Mallon, who admits to nervousness about being accused of plagiarism, has protected himself with what may be an all-time attribution record: his 238 pages of text are followed by 1,012 attributions, or 4.25 per page. And that's in addition to the occasional footnote.</p><p>Assembling 1,012 attributions was quite a task for this self-confessed ''unautomated writer,'' who does his first drafts in longhand, then types them, then pencil-edits. He said one editor accustomed to word processors once took a look at the untidy result and said, ''Boy! I haven't seen one like this for a while.'' Mr. Mallon notes that ''some students complain they can't read my comments on their papers,'' but says his hand is legible. ''I am a diarist and I love handwriting.''</p><p>It was his diary, and his previous book on diarists, that led him to look at plagiarism, what he calls ''the flip side of diaries.'' He found that there had been no serious work on the subject for 30 years, and he resolved to write one.</p><p>Mr. Mallon, who teaches writing and who alternates fiction with nonfiction, is writing a novel, ''Aurora 7,'' about the day in 1962 when Scott Carpenter orbited the earth. The voice is that of an 11-year-old boy, who sees parallels between problems in his family and those faced by Mr. Carpenter on his flight.
