                    <p>They take team sports seriously at the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house on State Street, in the heart of the University of Michigan campus.</p><p>Just last week, several Alpha Delts drove six hours to Lexington, Ky., to watch the Wolverines beat North Carolina and Virginia in the Southeast Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament to qualify for the Final Four.</p><p>Early this week, during the balmy noon hour, a dozen Alpha Delts stood on the big upper porch of the frat house, sipping beverages and looking down on the lawn below, where a dozen shirtless brothers played volleyball.</p><p>The students on the porch spoke of Michigan's semifinal Saturday against Illinois in Seattle and why the Wolverines' fourth trip to the Final Four has sparked only a moderate level of visible enthusiasm around the campus.

                    <p>''Before I got here, everyone said this campus is football, football, football,'' said John Klise, a 21-year-old senior French major from Winnetka, Ill. ''I guess it must be true. If this were the Rose Bowl, you'd probably see a lot more banners and stuff.''</p><p>It isn't as if the campus is ignoring the basketball team, whose coach, Bill Frieder, quit right before the tournament to take the coaching job at Arizona State.</p><p>All student tickets are sold for Seattle and the biggest challenge for some is to get plane reservations. Stop most any student on the ''Diag,'' the main pedestrian mall on campus, and you'll get an opinion of Frieder, probably negative, and reflection, usually positive, on the team's recent success, which has spread like a grass fire under the interim head coach, Steve Fisher.</p><p>It's just that the basketball team, even a potential national champion, must take its place alongside football and everything else at Michigan, a diverse, major university of 35,845 students, located about an hour's drive west of Detroit. 'Big Assignments'</p><p>''We're very proud of the basketball success, especially coming on the heels of an ambiguous and disappointing Big Ten season,'' said James A. Winn, professor of English, director of the Institute for the Humanities and a season-ticket holder for Wolverines basketball. ''But it is coming at a time of the term when people are very buckled down. Some big assignments are due.''</p><p>Life goes on in ways other than sports and classwork. While there aren't any basketball banners on the Diag, you can see signs for the Progressive Zionist Caucus and the Conservative Coalition and the Women's Glee Club Spring Concert. And the semifinal Saturday coincides with the annual ''Hash Bash,'' a demonstration of marijuana and hashish smoking on the Diag that has been an April Fool's Day tradition at Michigan since the late 1960's. Different strokes for different folks.</p><p>''I would describe the basketball mood as a 'quiet excitement,' '' said Joe Owsley, director of the university's news and information service. 'Alumni Love It'</p><p>He suggested that enthusiasm might be more obvious over in sports-oriented Detroit or among graduates who have moved away. ''The working people who didn't go here know us through our teams,'' Owsley said. ''They care a great deal. And the alumni love it; it's something they can relate to.''</p><p>They relate especially to football, played here since May 30, 1879, 12 years before the invention of basketball. Heck, Michigan taught Notre Dame how to play football, back in 1887.</p><p>''You wonder what it is like at Kentucky or at some other place where basketball means more,'' said Scott Keough, a 20-year-old junior who works at Moe Sport Shop on campus. He said there have been inquiries at the shop for Final Four T-shirts, which are expected to arrive Wednesday. But customers aren't lined up at the door, the way they are on a football Saturday. ''Around here,'' Keough said, ''football is king.''</p><p>During the basketball tournament, one of the most visible Michigan fans has been Bo Schembechler, the veteran head football coach and rookie athletic director. Schembechler took breaks from spring football practice to fly south for the regional games. Television cameras have shown him giving locker-room pep talks. Fisher rolled his eyes earlier this week when recalling how Schembechler said on camera how much he wanted to play the Illini in the semifinals.</p><p>Illinois is one of Schembechler's favorite football foes. No doubt, Fisher said, Illinois basketball coaches will screen that the tape of Schembechler's comments for their players. Team Seems Giddy</p><p>The closer you get to the Michigan basketball team, and especially to Fisher, the more you sense its giddiness over the improbability of the Wolverines' tournament roll.</p><p>Although they were picked to be among the nation's best teams before the season, the Wolverines struggled during a 24-7 regular season, with many of their victories coming against weak teams. In the Big Ten Conference, they were 12-6.</p><p>The crowds at Crisler Arena, criticized for being quiet much of the year, booed the Wolverines when they lost their last regular-season game, 89-73, to Illinois. Under Fisher, their unexpected success - blending confidence, speed and 3-point shooting - has hit like an unexpected inheritance from the will of a distant relative.</p><p>''It's like a fairy tale; it's not even Cinderella, it's like the prince just kissed Sleeping Beauty,'' said Bruce Madej, the sports-information director. ''When the tournament started, we were in a fog. We didn't know if we were ready. For the first two games, we didn't bring the band and cheerleaders. At the press conferences, writers were asking Bo about spring football.''</p><p>Fisher, a candidate for the job next year, seems slightly befuddled, if not pleasantly overwhelmed. He told reporters of feeling guilty when he sits at home and listens to friends leave good wishes on his telephone-answering machine. He wants to pick up the phone and talk, he said, but if he did, he wouldn't have time to coach.</p><p>A year ago, he was helping Frieder recruit and worrying about his seat at the Final Four, in a distant corner, high above the court. He was also concerned about his future, wondering if, at the age of 43, he would ever get a chance to be a head coach in a collegiate program. Looking for Full Effort</p><p>''The world twists in a lot of turns,'' Fisher said Monday in his office. ''Right now, our kids are as confident a group of players as could be playing anything. They probably think they can beat the Pistons.''</p><p>Shortly after he spoke, players began to arrive for practice. If anyone on campus has Final Four fever, it is this bunch. Glen Rice and Loy Vaught cruised up in a sporty white car. Blaring through a window was a rap song by Big Daddy Kane called ''Ain't No 1/2 Steppin'.'' It's all about giving full effort.</p><p>Into the locker room walked Demetrius Calip, wearing a custom-made Final Four shirt with his portrait on it. Terry Mills, who stopped to chat with reporters, said that, from his perspective, the campus mood was focused totally on basketball.</p><p>''It's hard to get anything accomplished in terms of school work,'' he said. ''It's like you're the president of campus.''  It Can't Hurt</p><p>SEATTLE, March 28 (AP) - The Michigan Wolverines will have a homecourt advantage for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Final Four in teh Kingdome this weekend.</p><p>The floor, 6,720 square feet of hardwood maple, was made in Dollar Bay, Mich., by the Horner Floor Company.</p><p>''We painted the lane blue, because Michigan's going to win,'' Bill Gappy, company director of portable sales, said. Actually, the court colors, graphics and other details are all determined by the N.C.A.A.</p><p>Photos of Sean Higgins, a forward on the University of Michigan basketball team; interim head coach, Steve Fisher (NYT/Peter Yates)</p>                </div>
