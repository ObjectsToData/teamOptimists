We were, after all, totally caught up in the post-World War II national pride and military self-confidence fostered by Army parades down the Grand Concourse and by comic books and films.</p><p>Those parades on Memorial Day in the late 40's had been the high point of our year. The soldiers marched north on the Concourse all the way from the Yankee Stadium area to Edgar Allan Poe Park.</p>                </div>

                    <p>We waited expectantly at Poe Park, standing on tiptoes and jostling each other for position, as we picked up the first distant sounds of the approaching drums. Then, where the Concourse emerges from beneath the Fordham Road overpass, the huge brown wave appeared, led by a color guard of four flag-bearing soldiers. So wide was this brown sea, so prodigious was this ever-extending brown tongue emerging from the mouth of the tunnel, that we concluded that the entire United States Army must be right there.</p><p>Suddenly concerned, we wondered who was guarding the rest of the country.</p><p>Just as baseball players sometimes toss baseballs to kids in the stands, some soldiers threw spent bullet shells to children along the parade route. These trophies were more valuable to us than any baseball card, more desirable even than an Imperial yo-yo, which cost $1.</p><p>Our military enthusiasm was equally fueled by the comic books that we bought each week at a drugstore on Kingsbridge Road. In the early part of the Korean War, the comic books were still fighting World War II. Huge German Tiger tanks were incapacitated by clever G.I. foot soldiers; large squadrons of Japanese Zeros were decimated by far fewer American fighter planes. Once in a while, an American was killed.</p><p>Soon, the Messerschmitts became MIG's, black German crosses turned into red Russian stars, and Asian faces belonged to new uniforms. The message we received for our dime was still the same: the American military was both just and invincible.</p><p>War films conveyed a similar message. Not even popular television shows such as ''Howdy Doody''; ''Tom Corbett, Space Cadet,'' or ''Captain Video,'' introduced by the rousing Flying Dutchman Overture of Richard Wagner, appealed to us as much as those films.</p><p>The RKO-Fordham was our favorite theater, and we went there nearly every Saturday.</p><p>We never knew that it was possible to find out the starting time of a film and thus see it from the beginning. As a result, nearly every Saturday afternoon we paid a quarter, arrived somewhere during a film, watched the end of it, then the next film, then a cartoon, serial, newsreel, and coming attractions before finally seeing the beginning of the original film.</p><p>One time, absolutely by chance, of course, we arrived at the very beginning of a war film. American anti-aircraft gunners were rushing to their battle stations as two Japanese planes menaced from above. This was good. Clearly, there would be plenty of action in this film. But to the Americans' surprise - and to our great disappointment - the planes did not attack. Instead, they dipped their wings in a strange salute and flew off.</p><p>The Americans soon learned that the war had just ended. For us, this was not good. It did not matter what the rest of the film might be about. We were so let down, we left the theater immediately and went to play punchball in Poe Park.</p><p>A few occurrences chipped away at the idol of war that we kids worshiped, nudged it a bit but couldn't topple it.</p><p>At Public School 46, for example, we began to have air-raid drills. We crouched under our sturdy, brown wood desks,our personal protection against A-bombs. Because of two very bad Americans, we learned, the Russians did have A-bombs.</p><p>At school, we also received dog tags with our names and addresses on them, the very same tags our heroes, the G.I.'s, had in the comics and films.</p><p>I still have mine. Our teacher never told us why we needed them, but we understood that if the North Koreans or the Chinese or the Russians bombed our school, our mothers would want to identify us. Strangely, though, mothers themselves never got dog tags.</p><p>Soon, yellow and black air-raid-shelter signs appeared and proliferated throughout our neighborhood. There was one on the basement of our apartment building on the south side of Poe Park. My mother explained that we would have to go there if we got bombed, but someone else added that the radiation would kill us anyway.</p><p>Those foreboding situations notwithstanding, my two best friends and I hurried down Valentine Avenue to the RKO-Fordham one Saturday afternoon to see the latest war movie. The film was the best we had ever seen.</p><p>It filled us with such patriotic fervor, such desire to be a soldier, that we rushed out of the theater, made a sharp right turn, and ran in our Keds and PF canvas sneakers one block west on Fordham Road to the Concourse where two identical recruiting stations faced each other, like guards on each side of the Concourse overpass.</p><p>Gateways to the nation's wars, they are still there today. Now, their paint is peeling and they are covered with unintelligible graffiti. When we arrived there, though, after our dash from the RKO, they were proud and clean, and we entered hesitantly and respectfully as we would a church. One represented the United States Navy and the Marines Corps, the other the Army and Air Force.</p><p>The amused officers in both stations gave each of us a handful of glossy brochures, and we rushed home to look at them.</p><p>Opposite the elevator in my building were rows of mailboxes for the tenants. Too young to have my own key, I would always stop and peek through the holes of our box to see if we had mail. Standing in front of the mailboxes, a tiny, gray-haired, well-dressed woman was crying uncontrollably.</p><p>I had never seen a grown-up cry before. Her tall son stood next to her and stared at an open letter. ''I never thought I'd be drafted,'' I heard him say as I entered the elevator, my recruiting brochures tightly clutched in my hand. ''I never thought I'd be drafted.''</p><p>The doors shut and I ascended to my apartment, where my room waited with its toy-soldier collection, war comics stacked near my bed and carefully built plastic models of the latest jet fighters.</p>                </div>
