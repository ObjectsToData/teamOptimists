                    <p>A SEVEN-FOOT-TALL wigwam, stands at the center of the new permanent exhibit that will open this afternoon at the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History in Storrs. The exhibit is the latest development at a museum which, at seven years old, is growing and thriving despite lacking its own building.</p><p>The new exhibit, ''One Circle Home: Life in an Algonkian Indian Culture,'' got its name from the circular wigwam and shows the history and culture of native Americans in Connecticut. It is the centerpiece of the museum's main exhibit room, in the Wilbur Cross Building on the University of Connecticut campus.</p><p>The museum was established by the university in 1982, was made the State Museum of Natural History in 1985 and opened officially that year in its new capacity. Its mandate is to preserve the state's natural heritage and enhance science education. Each year it has sponsored more exhibits and programs and increased its collections, even though its main exhibits must be displayed in three separate buildings, and its collections of some two million specimens must be stored here and there in 12 buildings.  More Important to Be Open</p><p>''We always felt it was important to be open, and have exhibits and programs, rather than wait for a fancy building,'' Carl W. Rettenmeyer, the director of the museum, said. ''One Circle Home'' is part of the museum's efforts to introduce more people to various aspects of Connecticut's natural history, from its minerals to its people, he said, and is intended to draw attention to the need to preserve the state's archeological heritage.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''People think that Connecticut history began 350 years ago,'' the State Archeologist, Nicholas F. Bellantoni, said. ''But, there has been a continuing native American presence here for 10,000 years.'' He noted that archeology makes it possible to re-create how early people lived.</p><p>Dr. Rettenmeyer added, ''There is a great lack of information on Connecticut Indians, and much of what people hear about Connecticut Indians is erroneous.''</p><p>Some people think Connecticut Indians lived, like Plains Indians, in skin-covered teepees, Dr. Rettenmeyer noted. But the typical dwelling of the state's first residents was a sapling-framed, bark-covered wigwam like the one made for the exhibit - with natural materials and primitive tools - by Jeff Kalin of Bethlehem, who is of Cherokee descent. Mr. Kalin was one of several state residents of Indian descent who joined Maryon Attwood, the exhibit coordinator, and other museum staff members in preparing the exhibit.</p><p>''One Circle Home'' makes reference not only to the circular wigwam, but also to the circles and cycles so important in Indian life and beliefs, from circular councils to seasonal agricultural cycles to the idea that all is part of the circle of life.</p><p>''There is a lot of philosophy that is valid for all people,'' Karen Coody Cooper of Watertown said. She is also of Cherokee descent and wrote the script that accompanies the exhibit.  'Part of the Circle'</p><p>The display includes artifacts, from a deer scapula hoe to a dugout canoe; photographs; illustrations, and life-sized silhouettes of Indians going about such activities as hunting and planting. ''I wanted to create some sense of the people, of community,'' said Collin Harty, who designed and constructed the exhibit.</p><p>Reproductions in the exhibit include the wigwam, such furnishings as baskets, and musical instruments and games that visitors are invited to play. ''Visitors become part of the circle,'' Ms. Cooper said.</p><p>Visitors can also read comments by present-day Indians, like the reminiscences of Trudie Lamb-Richmond, a Schaghiticoke who lives on her tribe's reservation in Kent and remembers learning about plants from her grandmother. And they can read John Winthrop's 1638 account of how the English settlers treated the Indian Sequin after he gave them land in Wethersfield: ''They drave him away by force.''</p><p>Organizers of the exhibit said that after contact with the Europeans, it became difficult for native Americans to maintain their culture. But today, some 5,000 people of Indian descent live in Connecticut, and, Mr. Harty said, ''we hope the exhibit will help them to re-create their past.'' Ms. Cooper noted that the inclusion in the exhibit of photographs and comments of Indians who live successful lives today shows clearly that the Indians are neither a vanished group nor an odd one. ''The people are here; they are modern people, and they are a respectable group,'' Ms. Cooper said.</p><p>Visitors to ''One Circle Home'' can also see other displays in the main exhibit room, which contains what Dr. Rettenmeyer calls ''by design, a mixture of things.''</p><p>Displays include stuffed birds of prey (from a collection of about 270 purchased by the museum four years ago) and about a dozen animal skins from the museum's collection of about 10,000.</p><p>The museum has two other exhibit areas on campus. A narrow gallery in Jorgensen Auditorium is the home of a shark exhibit, which includes a fiberglass mold of a great white shark, made directly from a 16-footer that landed in Noank in 1983. Also part of the museum are the greenhouses managed by UConn's ecology and evolutionary biology department. Their 10 separate rooms contain more than 3,000 varieties of plants. ''We clearly need a building to tie everything together,'' Dr. Rettenmeyer said. ''We have told the state. We have told the university.'' He added that some of the scattered collections are stored in poor environmental conditions.</p><p>Nonetheless, the museum keeps growing. In 1983 it had 1 exhibit, gave 12 programs, reported attendance at 91 and had a budget of less than $20,000. In 1988 it sponsored 33 exhibits and 252 programs, on campus and off, and reported attendance at 41,425. It received $177,800 from the state and $71,927 from memberships, contributions and grants.</p><p>The museum's off-campus programs reach people all over the state, Dr. Rettenmeyer said. Particularly popular are traveling photographic exhibits, including one on penguin life by the naturalist Roger Tory Peterson of Lyme.</p><p>With two grants from the Connecticut Humanities Council, the museum is currently organizing two traveling exhibits, one on Connecticut archeology and another on Indian life, and is also preparing an informative leaflet for visitors to ''One Circle Home.''  'A Challenge'</p><p>The museum continues to enlarge its collections through purchases and donations. Dr. Rettenmeyer noted that the museum actively seeks collections of specimens because in the past, many examples of the state's natural heritage - from mineral collections to Indian artifacts - have been sold, moved or donated to places outside the state and been lost to Connecticut.</p><p>''Running this museum is a challenge,'' said Dr. Rettenmeyer, who teaches biology at UConn and dashes off in his van whenever he hears of a valuable collection for sale. ''But with every month that goes by, more people discover that this museum is here. It's a very great resource.''</p><p>The museum's main exhibit area in the Wilbur Cross Building is open Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 P.M. and Mondays from noon to 4 P.M. The shark exhibit is open Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., and 1 to 5 P.M. on Saturdays and Sundays. The greenhouses are open 8 A.M. to 4 P.M., Monday through Friday. Admission is free.</p><p>Photo of designer Collin Harty with archeologist Nicholas P. Bellatoni and museum director Carl W.
