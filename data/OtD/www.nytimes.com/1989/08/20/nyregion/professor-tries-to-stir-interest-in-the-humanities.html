                    <p>EDUCATORS have forgotten the history of the humanities, according to a Connecticut College professor, who says that a liberal arts education in America is not what it should be - a quest for wisdom and virtue.</p><p>The professor, Robert Proctor, who teaches Italian at Connecticut College in New London, says that an understanding of Western tradition is missing in higher education. The ideals that are ''desperately needed'' and ''valid for everyone,'' he said, have been lost.</p><p>Professor Proctor has been speaking out at Connecticut College and elsewhere to show how a new look at the humanities can give coherence to college curriculums and direction to students. He is also the author of ''Education's Great Amnesia,'' which was published late last year by Indiana University Press. The subtitle of the book is ''Reconsidering the Humanities From Petrarch to Freud, With a Curriculum for Today's Students.''</p><p>''I think these issues should be discussed widely,'' he said. ''We're not able to solve the problems of the modern world with the ideals of the modern world. The 'Me Generation' has to be balanced with the ancients' sense of duty and responsibility to others.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I think kids today are looking for something,'' added Professor Proctor, a member of a committee at Connecticut College that is trying to structure an ideally balanced curriculum.  'Modern Sense of Self'</p><p>Professor Proctor says that educators need to look at how the humanities began, how they changed and finally how they have deteriorated. ''To use that tradition today,'' he said, ''we have to come to terms with why it fell apart. We can't re-enact, but we can revise and reappropriate to come up with something new, to go beyond the modern sense of self.''</p><p>Just what are the humanities? That question set Professor Proctor off on the work that led to his book. In the late 1970's, he recalled, he was a fellow at the National Humanities Institute at Yale University, where fellows and staff members met each week for a lunchtime discussion of the humanities.</p><p>''There were 20 of us, every Wednesday, with brown bags,'' he said. ''We loved being together, but we disbanded after a month, because we couldn't agree on what to talk about.'' Group members could not agree on what the humanities were or should be, he said.</p><p>Professor Proctor notes that the Oxford English dictionary defines the humanities as ''learning or literature concerned with human culture, especially the ancient Latin and Greek classics.'' That, he said, is what they used to be. But today, people tend to think of the humanities as any studies that are not science, he said, and the National Endowment for the Humanities offers no definition, only a list of disciplines that it may finance.  Curiosity Piqued</p><p>When his lunchtime companions - all interested and committed - could not agree, Professor Proctor found his curiosity piqued. He began to look at the origins of the humanities, first with colleagues at Connecticut College and then during a year of study in Italy. His study convinced him that understanding the ideas behind the humanities would help today's students, whose main concerns, he said, range from a too-great desire to ''make big bucks'' to a fear of ''a nuclear or ecological holocaust.''</p><p>In his book, Professor Proctor discusses Petrarch, who sought and studied the ancient texts of Cicero and other Romans to find guidance for his own difficult life in the 14th century. He describes how Petrarch led the humanist movement that created the Renaissance and replaced the medieval university curriculums with the study of Latin and Greek literature, history and moral philosophy. For the humanists, the study of the ancients led to the new idea of an autonomous inner-self molded by study.</p><p>But, Professor Proctor said, ''the autonomous self of Petrarch - the self that could be molded and shaped - is not there in Cicero.'' Instead, he said, Cicero wrote that each was part of the cosmos, part of the whole; to be human was to participate in the whole. From the start, the humanists also advised studying literature and poetry, not nature. Yet, the ancients thought that all was important, for all was part of the cosmos.  Breakdown of Relationship</p><p>The Greek and especially Latin studies prescribed by the humanists were the core of secondary and university education in the West for centuries, yet they deteriorated over the years, Professor Proctor said. Petty scholarship, poor teaching and increased emphasis on modern literature and languages all took their toll. In addition, Freud showed the unconscious self - a self-resistant to being molded.</p><p>''The relationship between the self and the whole has broken down,'' Professor Proctor said, and the ideas of the Renaissance have turned into narcissism.</p><p>He said that such study would prepare students to look beyond themselves in dealing with modern problems, like a world threatened by pollution.</p><p>When his publisher asked him to include a model curriculum in his book, Professor Proctor said he was reluctant simply to list courses. He listed as examples such courses as ''Classical Antiquity and Its Transformation in the Renaissance: The Birth of the Autonomous Self.'' He also discussed questions students should try to answer, among them ''how can one obtain wisdom and virtue today?''  'Thought-Provoking Questions'</p><p>The curriculum committee at Connecticut College is also posing such questions that students would answer before graduating, he said. ''We're proposing that every student coming into the college be given a list of 25 broad, thought-provoking questions, based on the liberal arts tradition and on the rest of the world.'' Students would not be able to answer the questions just by taking certain courses, he said. Besides understanding the tradition of the humanities, they would have to talk to others, read and think.</p><p>The humanities also provide a basis for contrast and comparison of various cultures, he said. Professor Proctor said that ideals like Cicero's are valid for everyone and badly needed in the world and that, until now, women and minorities have largely been excluded from the tradition of the humanities.</p><p>''But now is the time to bring them into this tradition,'' he said. ''It should be democratized.'' He added that the tradition belongs to those who, through hard work and study, engage in a dialogue with the thinkers of the past.</p><p>Photo of Prof. Robert Proctor, professor of Italian Connecticut College of New London (NYT/Gale Zucker)</p>                </div>
