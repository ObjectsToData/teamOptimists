The guest speaker, Alice Turkel, a school committee member, compared them to the residents of the mythical Lake Wobegone.</p><p>''Every graduate at Graham and Parks is above average,'' she said.</p><p>Leonard Solo, the principal of Graham and Parks, a progressive public elementary and middle school in Cambridge, sent his students off with advice from Bob Dylan: ''Now each of us has his own special gift; you know that was meant to be true, and if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.'' Then Mr. Solo hugged each of them as they walked across the stage to claim their diplomas.</p><p>For the 47 eighth graders, most of whom had entered Graham and Parks in kindergarten,  graduation on Thursday had loomed every bit as large as the other, more widely publicized commencement that was held last week across town, at Harvard University.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''It's so permanent, final and definite,'' said Rachel Philbrick, 14. With all the melodrama of youth, Henrietta Oakley, 14, added, ''It's the end -- the end of everything.''</p><p>In many communities, graduations are so common at all grade levels, starting with preschool, that they begin to lose their significance as turning points in life. But at Graham and Parks, leaving eighth grade is so momentous, and the school makes such a fuss over graduation, that it becomes a time when 13- and 14-year-olds normally preoccupied with such things as, say, the symbolism of sneaker laces and face glitter, are instead pondering the meaning of transitions.</p><p>It was the end of elementary school, the end of moving together as a class through the day, the end of recess, the end of life in the four-story red brick building where, with only 376 students, it is possible to know just about everyone.</p><p>Of course, like so many other endings, graduation also marks the beginning of other things, starting with high school. ''It's the first step to the real world,'' said Stephane Gracia, 13.</p><p>Isabel Yalouris, 14, said she was ready.</p><p>''When I was in second grade, I felt I could be in elementary school for the rest of my life,'' she said. ''But now, whoa! I've got to move on.''</p><p>Three nights before his graduation, Judd Bornheimer, 14, stayed up an hour past his bedtime, reviewing his life at Graham and Parks. ''I was just sitting in bed, in the dark, thinking about what I've gone through,'' he said. ''My first day in kindergarten, I cried, 'Mom and Dad, don't leave me!' I was very shy, very family-oriented.''</p><p>These days no one would call Judd shy. With his teachers commending his kindness to others, he shared the Graham and Parks community service award today with a classmate, Daniel Mehr. Judd has his own call-in show on a Cambridge cable television station. He is a lineman on the Warriors, a Pop Warner football team. He has overcome some major obstacles, including the breakup of his parents' marriage.</p><p>''I'm becoming my own person,'' Judd said.</p><p>This has naturally created conflicts with his mother, Carole Bellew.</p><p>''We've been disagreeing on a lot of things,'' Judd said.</p><p>''I want to tie my sneakers on the fourth lace,'' he said. ''She wants me to tie them on the sixth lace. She doesn't understand what I'm going through.''</p><p>Ketna Julmeus, 13, who is the president of the eighth grade class and who arrived from Haiti five years ago, feels the same way about her father. ''He doesn't understand American culture,'' she said.</p><p>Forty-two percent of the students at Graham and Parks -- the school is named for Rosa Parks and Saundra Graham, an African-American Cambridge community organizer -- are white and 58 percent are African-American,  Asian or Hispanic. They are the sons and daughters of bookkeepers and cabdrivers as well as doctors and college professors. They boast about the diversity of their class.</p><p>Still, Graham and Parks, like childhood itself, is no utopia.</p><p>''I was ridiculed from kindergarten to third grade,'' Daniel Mehr said.</p><p>''I was big,'' said Daniel who, at 6 feet 2 inches tall, towers over his classmates. ''And I was always somewhat chubby. In the beginning, I went to the teacher. But then I said, 'What the heck, they're going to keep doing it, I might as well get used to it.' ''</p><p>Daniel has since found a circle of friends who share his interest in math and science, sailing and laser tag. But he will be leaving the group in September. His family is moving to the suburbs so that Daniel can go to the nationally acclaimed Lexington High School.</p><p>Most of his classmates are going on to Cambridge Rindge and Latin, the public high school here, with 2,500 students. ''We're going to a huge high school where we're going to know nobody,'' Henrietta Oakley said.</p><p>Ben Wisner, 14, said he wished he could join the handful of his classmates who will be going to private schools. ''Rindge is too big,'' he said. ''You could get lost. A private school is more of a community.''</p><p>It is not only high school that some are worried about getting lost in. ''We're told we can be anything and do anything,'' Isabel Yalouris said. But she already knows that reality may be somewhat different.</p><p>''I want to be an actress,'' Isabel said. ''But you can go to Hollywood and be a nothing. You can fall through the cracks.''</p><p>Susan McCray was listening to Isabel, Emma and Ben talk moments before graduation. Ms. McCray had taught the eighth graders humanities. She had been in the school, watching them emerge, since they were in fourth grade. ''It's the end of childhood,'' she said.</p><p>Not so fast.</p><p>''We're kids,'' Isabel said. ''We're older kids, but we're still kids.''</p><p>Photo: In the graduation procession on Thursday at Graham and Parks in Cambridge, Mass., some eighth graders were somber, and others smiling.
