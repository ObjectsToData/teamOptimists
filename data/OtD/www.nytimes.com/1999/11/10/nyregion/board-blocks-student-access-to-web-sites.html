                    <p>The Board of Education has installed a filter on its computer system that blocks students in New York City schools from gaining access to any Web sites that include categories like news and sex education, including those of major news outlets, policy groups and scientific and medical organizations, officials acknowledged yesterday.</p><p>Students, parents and teachers at Benjamin Cardozo High School in Queens, one of the city's most prestigious and competitive schools, said yesterday they had complained to the New York Civil Liberties Union, because the blocking program made it almost impossible for them to do sophisticated research projects on the Internet.</p><p>Jan Shakofsky, a humanities teacher at Cardozo, said her students discovered the filter when they tried to carry out an assignment on ''researching the pros and cons of an issue.'' When they tried to determine how members of Congress had been rated by the National Rifle Association, they received a message saying, ''Access Denied.''</p><p>They were given the same message when they tried to call up sites about breast cancer, anorexia and bulimia, child labor, AIDS and groups that support abortion -- but not those that oppose it -- because they contained censored words. Even part of John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath'' was forbidden, students said yesterday, because of a passage in which a woman lets a starving man suckle at her breast.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''I have to tell you, I'm not a true civil libertarian,'' Ms. Shakofsky said. ''I'm the mean person who asks them to delete solitaire, Free Cell, hearts and minesweeper from their computers. I don't think they should have pornography. But I felt they should be able to do research.''</p><p>Teachers said the censorship was not unique to Cardozo, but had plagued schools throughout the city that had recently expanded their computer programs, using a federal grant that has allowed every school in the city to be connected to the Internet, mainly through the Board of Education's server at Metrotech in Brooklyn. The same server, officials said, is used by many computers within the Board of Education.</p><p>Rather than create its own policy on student access, teachers said, the board purchased a commercial filtering program, I-Gear, and let it set the standards. I-Gear, made by Urlabs, a subsidiary of the Symantec Corporation, is one of the most popular filtering programs, school officials said, and is used by school systems across the country and in Canada.</p><p>Bernard I. May, senior product manager for Symantec of Cupertino, Calif., said yesterday that the program has a setting that allows selected categories, from sports to pornography to stock trading, to be filtered.  He said I-Gear has ''absolutely no preference of one group or another,'' like those favoring or opposing abortion.</p><p>The filter is made so that an administrator can tailor it to schools, teams of students or even individual students. He said that used correctly, it is capable of distinguishing among phrases like ''chicken breast, breast cancer and big breasts.''</p><p>Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group, faxed a letter to Chancellor Rudy Crew yesterday, complaining that the board was engaging in ''broad censorship of Internet access,'' by blocking entire categories of Web sites based on forbidden words and phrases.</p><p>''The blocking program sweeps far too broadly,'' Mr. Siegel said in his letter. ''It significantly undermines teachers' ability to conduct their lessons and students' ability to complete their classroom assignments on the Internet.''</p><p>The board has the right, Mr. Siegel said in an interview, to exercise judgment about what information is available to students, but he said it made no sense to adopt ''a software company's one size fits all standard,'' regardless of educational considerations, for all students from kindergarten through high school.</p><p>Pam McDonnell, a spokeswoman for Dr. Crew, said the Board of Education is drafting a policy on Internet access, which will allow schools to ''tweak'' the I-Gear filter. The policy, she said, will attempt to be sensitive to the concerns of parents and communities, and will be tailored to the ages of students.</p><p>Until now, many schools had used their own servers, and officials in those schools or in the local districts decided what information to restrict.</p><p>Some school officials said yesterday that the Board of Education had also made it difficult for children to use e-mail in class as a tool to exchange notes about homework, or to communicate with experts for class projects.</p><p>Accounts can be set up in the names of teachers, but not students, they said, and must go through the Board of Education. Teachers who have tried to set up free e-mail addresses for their students, through  Yahoo, for example, have found those services blocked, they said. Teachers said that even setting up a school Web site can be difficult, because parents must sign a release form before schools can display students' work.</p><p>Ms. McDonnell said schools could  establish e-mail accounts for students if they did not use the Board of Education server. But in practice, many schools have no other choice, teachers said.</p><p>Michael Sobotka, whose daughter, Kathryn, is a junior at Cardozo, said he objected to any form of Internet screening, because children were being denied the tools to investigate both sides of an issue and think for themselves. Mr. Sobotka, an importer of dental instruments, said school officials were overreacting when they perceived the Internet as more dangerous than traditional media, like print or television.</p><p>''I think it is unconscionable that our children are told what they can or what they cannot read or see,'' he said. ''Once you block one thing, you are agreeing that in essence, censorship is O.K., and I don't think it is.''</p><p>Donna Lieberman, director of the civil liberties union's Reproductive Rights Project, said that until about a week ago, students could see the Web sites for Right to Life and Operation Rescue, which oppose abortion, but were denied access to Planned Parenthood and the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which support abortion rights. She said that all sites dealing with abortion, pro and con, had been blocked after her office complained to the Board of Education.</p><p>Ms. Shakofsky, the teacher, said many of the students at her school lacked computers at home and relied on the school's computer room for  senior projects, including entries to  contests like the Westinghouse science competition. The board filter, she said, had put her students at a disadvantage to those at some other prestigious schools, like Midwood and Townsend Harris, that have access to university servers and can bypass the Board of Education.</p><p>Patty Lin, a senior at Cardozo, said that last year she used to go to school early in the morning just to do research in the computer room, ''because there's a teacher there to guide me through it.'' Since the filtering program was installed in September, she said, she has grown increasingly frustrated.</p><p>''When I try to look up something, it's not there,'' she said. ''What's the purpose of having the Internet at school, if I can't get access to what I'm looking for?''</p><p>Miss Lin, who plans to study business and prelaw in college, said she was disturbed by the filter's editorial judgments, with regard to abortion rights, for example.</p><p>''I think it just brainwashes some people,'' she said, ''because it's giving you one point of view and not the other.''</p>                </div>
