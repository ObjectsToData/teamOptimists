Scott Fitzgerald, Mr. West might be permitted a bit of cheerleading for his man over James Joyce, especially now as he prepares to bring out the 1924 novel that Fitzgerald completed and then tore apart to create ''Gatsby.''</p><p>The underlying novel was called ''Trimalchio'' by Fitzgerald, who wrote it while staying at St.-Raphael on the French Riviera. By contrast, Mr. West worked on its reconstruction in the less alluring mountains at Pennsylvania State University, where he is a specialist in the history of publishing and its impact on society.</p><p>And while Fitzgerald worked with an advance from Charles Scribner's Sons under the guidance of its great editor, Maxwell Perkins, Mr. West received partial financing for his work in the form of a $30,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which is publishing an article by Mr. West on ''Trimalchio'' in the January-February issue of its magazine Humanities.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The publication of discarded works by Fitzgerald's friend Ernest Hemingway has not been well received by critics. Of the most recent posthumous Hemingway, ''True at First Light,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times in June that it ''never should have seen the light of day.'' Given that reaction, was it wise to bring out the old Fitzgerald work?</p><p>''Very definitely yes,'' Mr. West said. '' 'Trimalchio' was a finished novel, which he submitted to his publisher in October 1924. That's different from an aborted novel or a fragment. Fitzgerald submitted 'Trimalchio' and in part because of his own second thoughts and in part because of Perkins's comments, he tore it apart and came up with 'The Great Gatsby,' which is entirely different.''</p><p>There are enough differences to allow teachers to broaden their courses in covering Fitzgerald's works, he said, adding, ''The teaching has become formulaic. 'Trimalchio' will give some new material for teachers to put into their lectures.''</p><p>Not all Fitzgerald scholars agree that bringing out ''Trimalchio'' is wise.</p><p>Prof. Jackson R. Bryer, a specialist in Fitzgerald and Hemingway at the University of Maryland, said that at best he was ambivalent about publishing ''Trimalchio'' and at worst felt it was ''a little unfair to Fitzgerald because that's not what he ended up with.''</p><p>While the underlying novel might be useful to some scholars, including himself, he questioned whether the book would have a broad readership.</p><p>In the best of worlds, he said, he would consider teaching a course on Fitzgerald by having his students read both ''Trimalchio'' and ''The Great Gatsby.'' But it is unrealistic, he said, to hope that any student would read beyond ''Gatsby.''</p><p>On the question of whether art was being served by publishing ''Trimalchio,'' Mr. Bryer asked, ''Would it be helpful to peel away the paint from the Sistine Chapel to see what Michelangelo put there first?''</p><p>No, he said, because Michelangelo wanted people to see his end result, and that was the case also with ''The Great Gatsby.''</p><p>''Trimalchio'' (pronounced tree-MAHL-kee-oh) is very similar to ''Gatsby'' in the first two chapters, Mr. West said. ''In Chapter 3, Fitzgerald started to revise the book,'' he went on, ''making significant changes in 3, 4 and 5 and completely rewriting Chapters 6 and 7 and making significant changes in 8 and 9.''</p><p>''Maxwell Perkins was unhappy with the way Gatsby's character was revealed,'' Mr. West said. ''He wanted us to learn about Gatsby in bits and pieces. There was big, big rewriting, and most of the book had to be reset.''</p><p>In 1925 Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, spent six weeks in Rome and on Capri, where Fitzgerald, a rapid worker, rewrote the book to meet Perkins's recommendations.</p><p>It is known that Fitzgerald worried endlessly over what to call his masterwork. ''At the end, Fitzgerald preferred 'Under the Red, White and Blue,' '' Mr. West said, ''but Perkins told him, blessedly, that it was too late.''</p><p>His rejected choice of ''Trimalchio'' drops a broad hint as to Gatsby's character, since it is taken from the name of a former slave in ancient Rome who becomes rich and tastelessly tries to win the respect of the first-century establishment.</p><p>The story is told in ''The Satyricon'' by Petronius, and Fitzgerald shifted it to the New York City and Long Island of the 1920's.</p><p>''There is a new party in 'Trimalchio,' a masquerade affair that presents a homily on celebrity,'' Mr. West said. ''Gatsby, an arriviste, thinks others will be impressed that he has as guests show business people -- performers, producers, sports stars. They are not.''</p><p>Was the discovery of ''Trimalchio'' the result of great detective work?</p><p>Not really. It was sitting in the Princeton University Library. ''People had known it was there,'' Mr. West explained. ''A number of scholars have commented on the differences between the two versions.''</p><p>He added, ''Fitzgerald scholars have known for years that there was an underlying manuscript to 'Gatsby.' The mind-set had been that it was the dross from which the golden icon was created.''</p><p>Today, Mr. West said, scholars have been seeking out such underlying works. ''Jerome McGann, at the University of Virginia, has urged us to see texts as existing in flux,'' he said. ''You study a literary work as it changes and exists in various stages.''</p><p>Other writers whose underlying works have benefited from such re-examination, Mr. West said, are William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, D. H. Lawrence and Richard Wright.</p><p>Fitzgerald died in 1940, at the age of 44, the victim of too much success too soon, but ''The Great Gatsby'' continues to sell 300,000 copies a year.</p><p>Mr. West's revival of the underlying book, with comments, footnotes and tables, will be published in May as ''Trimalchio: An Early Version of 'The Great Gatsby,' '' by the Cambridge University Press, priced at $39.95. A year later, a popular edition, stripped of the scholarly paraphernalia, is to be published in paperback.</p><p>Photo: F. Scott Fitzgerald as he appeared in the late 1920's. (Harcourt Brace)(pg.
