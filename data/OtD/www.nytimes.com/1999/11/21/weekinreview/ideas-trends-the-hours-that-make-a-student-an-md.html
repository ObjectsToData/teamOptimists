A few years later they discover they have turned into doctors.  And, for all the tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the alchemy of the transformation remains almost as mysterious as ever.</p><p>How many hours does it actually take to make a doctor? This is still one of the big mysteries of the process. Is medical care better delivered by a fatigued young doctor who has been at your bedside 36 hours -- or by a succession of fresh young strangers who work shorter shifts, and have heard about you through the medical equivalent of the game of telephone?</p>                </div>

                    <p>This century has seen a dramatic evolution in medical training from long working hours to shorter ones. Up through World War II, interns and residents in the United States were indentured servants in hospitals, available 24 hours a day. Most received little compensation (except for room and board) along with a free-form education that was shaped by whatever sick patients and senior physicians happened by.</p><p>Now their dual roles of worker and student are more precisely defined. As workers, interns and residents get days off and a living wage. As students, they attend lectures and conferences that encompass social and economic aspects of medicine long ignored in medical training. And as indentured servants -- for they continue to work many extra hours for the health care system -- they at least have the satisfaction of knowing that their day-to-day welfare is of more concern to their employers than it used to be.</p><p>In the days when interns worked every night or every other night, the pace of the work was slow enough that they could actually get some sleep. Technology put an end to that: in the 1970's and 1980's 36-hour stretches without a nap became commonplace, and workweeks could stretch to 100 hours or more.</p><p>''Working a double?'' a nurse once asked me when she noticed one morning that I was in the same place (and in the same clothes) she had seen me the evening before. I pointed out that I was actually working a quintuple, as I would every third night for most of my three years of residency.</p><p>A terrible accident changed that routine in New York. The death of a young woman, Libby Zion, was traced directly to these long, unsupervised hours, and in July 1989 the state Hospital Code was amended to restrict the average workweek to no more than 80 hours and mandate that a senior physician be available to supervise at all times.</p><p>New York remains the only state where these stipulations are law, but they are rapidly becoming the standard elsewhere. All internal medicine training programs are now held to similar standards, and failure to comply may result in a loss of accreditation.</p><p>Other medical specialties are following suit. So are other countries: New Zealand long ago limited its residents to a 72-hour workweek, and the European Union is now hashing out the practicalities of a 48-hour week for the 270,000 trainees in its member countries.</p><p>Several studies have now found that the mistakes doctors make from fatigue do diminish with shorter work hours, but they are replaced by errors that result when a patient's care is transferred from one doctor to another at the end of shorter shifts. No study has yet addressed the broader question: Will shorter workdays keep interns and residents from developing the important instincts those awful long nights hammered in -- a sense of the pace of illness and recovery, of what is likely to happen to a patient and when?</p><p>THESE details are, of course, the easy part of a medical education. I must grudgingly admit that the grisly old days of training -- may they never return -- helped teach us one of the harder lessons too.</p><p>Interns and residents are a spectacularly healthy lot of young people. Most are far too young to have encountered illness or death among friends or relatives; fewer still have ever been ill themselves. Yet somehow they all must learn to bridge a huge gap of imagination and develop some real feeling for the subjective experience, as well as the objective appearance, of disease.</p><p>Some educators say studying literature and the humanities can teach this kind of empathy. Others doubt it can be taught at all. One famous professor simply suggested that all interns be required to use a bedpan in front of a silent group of white-coated strangers, and see how it feels for themselves.</p><p>But here is an alternate route to empathy: stay awake every third night for three years, tired, aching, nauseated and terrified that despite the very best intentions in the world you are about to make a terrible mistake.</p><p>With any luck at all you will get a vague idea of how it must feel to be truly sick, powerless and frightened -- and with any luck the lesson will stick even after it is all over.</p><p>Photo: Studies have shown that a series of new doctors, not the overworked one of the past, also cause mistakes.
