Designed in the familiar style of current road signs, they carry images of long ago, such as a wigwam or a Colonial house, as well as logos that still apply today, like a boat launching or a deer-crossing symbol.    The multi-layered exhibition, which received financial support from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development and the Connecticut Humanities Council as well as corporate and private sources, is designed to appeal to families and school groups. It offers lively visual displays and hands-on activities like crafts and puzzles alongside treasures from the society's collection -- portraits, manuscripts, original documents and antique furniture that will engage the adults in the group.

                    <p>THE road signs that guide visitors in the new permanent exhibition at the Connecticut Historical Society in Hartford -- called ''Tours and Detours Through Early Connecticut -- symbolize one of the show's major goals: to make connections between past and present. Designed in the familiar style of current road signs, they carry images of long ago, such as a wigwam or a Colonial house, as well as logos that still apply today, like a boat launching or a deer-crossing symbol.</p><p>The multi-layered exhibition, which received financial support from the state's Department of Economic and Community Development and the Connecticut Humanities Council as well as corporate and private sources, is designed to appeal to families and school groups. It offers lively visual displays and hands-on activities like crafts and puzzles alongside treasures from the society's collection -- portraits, manuscripts, original documents and antique furniture that will engage the adults in the group.</p><p>''The word tours in the show's title refers to the actual road that is marked into the floor of the exhibition galleries, leading the visitor on a chronological journey that begins in the early 1600's and ends in the late 1700's,'' said Kate Steinway, the society's director of exhibitions. ''Detours implies that history is not clear or linear, and we take detours down various paths to learn, for example, what home life was like in a Colonial household or what role slavery and indentured servitude played in early Connecticut.''</p><p>At the start of the show, visitors can choose the path of American Indians, to discover how the earliest inhabitants lived and learn the origins of the names they gave places, or the path that explores what life was like for the newly arrived Europeans as they struggled to establish a foothold in what was for them a hostile and dangerous land.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The two paths came together shortly after the start of European settlement, as Colonists brought new materials, products and ideas that forever altered the native Americans' way of life.</p><p>A table-top puzzle map of Connecticut about 1640 enables visitors to understand how both ative people and new settlers adapted the land to suit their needs. By lifting up the puzzle pieces that show fruit trees planted by English colonists, for example, or the pieces that depict animals such as deer and beaver, visitors can learn more about which foods and materials were indigenous and which imported.</p><p>The exhibition explains the differences in value systems and how misunderstandings soon led to open conflict, with episodes of attacks, enslavement and captive taking, culminating in the Pequot War in 1637 and King Philip's War, in 1675 and 1676.</p><p>Among the period weapons on display is an English sword used in the Pequot War and a American Indian war club. And an engraving printed in London in 1638 depicts an Indian fort in New England under siege.</p><p>In a recording of contemporary people reading from primary sources, as well as in quotations from letters and books, settlers and natives talk about each other: ''Please remember that all the words of the Natives were written down by the English and not by the Natives themselves,'' cautions the label, careful, as is all the exhibition's text, to avoid stereotypes.</p><p>The tour describes the unfolding of the state's early history as outposts gave way to small communities.</p><p>A mural showing a typical Connecticut landscape has been made into a large magnet board, and visitors are encouraged to select from a variety of magnetized emblems of structures -- houses, barns, churches, mills, stone walls and cemeteries -- to create a Connecticut community of the 1700's.</p><p>The home as residence, as place of work and as hospital is the focus of the section entitled Colonial Lives. The role of women in running the home and farm is emphasized as well as the presence of slaves.</p><p>Objects made in 18th-century Connecticut are on display: a high chest of drawers from Colchester, a spinning wheel, a cattle yoke, a candle stand crafted in Hartford and a child's potty chair made of red maple (the last item a favorite among younger viewers).</p><p>Visitors, surrounded by reproductions of samplers, are urged to try their hand at embroidery, using plastic colored thread on a white plastic grid, and also at making moccasins, a traditional Indian craft.</p><p>Perhaps the most popular exhibit is a replica of a Colonial farmhouse, where children can try on reproductions of period clothing -- petticoats, corsets and aprons as well as breeches and waistcoats -- and can pretend to cook and eat a Colonial-style dinner.</p><p>The section on the Revolutionary War highlights the conflict many Colonists felt in choosing sides. After pondering some of the issues that divided those remaining loyal to England (''Loyalists'') and those in favor of self government (''Patriots''), visitors are asked to vote for or against English rule.</p><p>''Press a Button to Start the Revolution'' reads a signpost. Well, not quite, but visitors can hear recorded voices reading first-person accounts of Revolutionary War experiences, including the tale of 22-year-old Deborah Champion of Colchester, who rode on horseback through enemy lines to Boston to take papers to Gen. George Washington and was praised by him for her courage.</p><p>A handsome red wool cloak said to have been worn by Champion on her historic mission is on display, along with other Revolutionary era objects such as a powder horn belonging to a soldier from Wethersfield, a dress sword owned by Gen. Israel Putnam of Pomfret and a small swivel cannon made at the Salisbury iron works about 1777.</p><p>The iron furnaces of northwestern Connecticut churned out cannons, cannonballs, bullets, bayonets and guns for the Continental army, while shipyards along the Connecticut River built and outfitted vessels that plundered British ships. Their output, combined with a large-scale home effort to produce food and clothing for the soldiers, made a vast contribution to the Revolutionary cause and earned Connecticut the designation of Provision State.</p><p>No exhibition devoted to Colonial Connecticut could ignore the topic of the Charter Oak -- the true story of the charter granted by England to the colony in 1662 and the myth that grew around its disappearance 25 years later, when a new king attempted to repeal it because it granted Connecticut an unusual measure of self-government.</p><p>Legend has it that an early Revolutionary War sympathizer hid the charter in the hollow of a large oak tree that stood in Hartford. For almost two centuries, the old tree was venerated as an icon, and when a storm felled it in 1856, its wood was made into innumerable souvenirs, large and small, some of which found their way into the collections of the historical society. On view are chess pieces, a pitcher, beads, a goblet, jewelry made by Tiffany and Company, as well as a tall clock made in Hartford in the 1870's.</p><p>A reproduction of the charter is on hand to recall this episode, and young visitors are urged to celebrate the independent spirit of Connecticut Olonists by hiding it in a hole of a make-believe tree.</p><p>The Connecticut Historical Society (1 Elizabeth Street, Hartford; 860-236-5621) is open Tuesday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $6, $3 for people 60 and over and students, free for children under 6.</p><p>Photos: Survival in a new land, and battles with its inhabitants, were among Colonial settlers' preoccupations.; Richard Jackson and his daughters Dayshima and Richelle of Bloomfield were among recent visitors at the exhibition; bottom, the girls try on clothing with help from Rebecca Furer of the Historical Society staff.
