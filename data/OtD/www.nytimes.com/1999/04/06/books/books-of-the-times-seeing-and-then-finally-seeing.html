Jim Knipfel's life, recounted in his new memoir, ''Slackjaw,'' sounds like a bad dream: He discovered in his early 20's that he was afflicted with a rare genetic illness called retinitis pigmentosa, which would leave him blind in a couple years, and he also learned that he was suffering from a form of epilepsy that caused depression and ''rage seizures.'' His marriage was falling apart, he was drinking heavily, and he couldn't find a job.  ">

                    <p>''I keep returning to that simple mantra of mine, Deal With It,'' he writes, ''while recognizing that life has become one long slapstick routine -- like living a Marx Brothers movie, except without quite so many musical numbers.''</p><p>It was Mr. Knipfel's sardonic sense of humor and his keen sense of the absurd that kept him from going through with his plans to commit suicide, and those same qualities enliven this memoir, making his account of his travails less depressing than funny, heroic and, yes, entertaining. Mr. Knipfel -- a staff writer and columnist for New York Press -- is also blessed with a natural, one might even say reflexive, knack for telling stories, and in this volume he spins the most ordinary of events (a subway ride, a trip to Times Square, a visit to a bar) into rollicking adventures, crammed full of paranoia, suspense and giddy self-dramatization.</p><p>Mr. Knipfel, himself, emerges as a sort of middle-class rebel, a would-be anarchist and outsider who has read a lot of Kafka, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky. He and a friend considered naming their rock band ''The Wolf Man, the Rat Man and the Psychotic Dr. Schreber,'' after the subtitle to Freud's ''Three Case Histories''; in college they formed a political group called the ''Nihilist Workers' Party.''  Mr. Knipfel later takes to wearing a black fedora in hopes that it will make him look like Bogart or Cagney. And when he starts losing his sight, he considers buying a walking stick with a silver wolf's head handle instead of a blind man's white cane. He was, he says, ''a walking cliche.''</p><p>After completing college with a degree in philosophy, Mr. Knipfel enrolls in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where he teaches an introduction to humanities course. He complains, however, that his students simply regurgitate his lectures back to him in garbled form. (''Nietzsche's sister married an anti-semantic.'' ''The poem argued for carpe diem -- that is, 'cease the day.' '') And he soon tires of ''writing papers about papers other people had written about books other people had written about some cultural icon or work of art.'' He turns to a life of petty crime.</p><p>He orders some brass knuckles from an ad in Soldier of Fortune, learns the craft of shoplifting and begins hanging out with ''dealers, other thieves, hookers, pimps, a few men who claimed to be murderers.''</p><p>Shoplifting, it turns out, will be only one of his many careers. He also works at a used-book store and a pornography shop. He tries running a bar, works as a guard at the Guggenheim Museum, and takes a long-term job as a receptionist (a decidedly undiplomatic one, it must be said, who tells callers they've got ''25-to-1 odds'' of talking to the person they're calling).</p><p>As Mr. Knipfel's eyesight deteriorates, it becomes increasingly difficult to get to work or run the most mundane errands. He finds himself walking in ''a hunchback shuffle'' to avoid getting hurt. He uses his wide-brimmed hat, like a cat's whiskers, as a sort of early warning system for objects he might run into. And he divests himself of most of his possessions (including his beloved books) so he can better navigate his apartment. His life grows progressively smaller. ''I had never much liked going out before,'' he writes, ''even when I could see, but now, whenever someone asked me to stop by, or meet at a bar, or go out to dinner, my throat tightened, dread filled my guts.''</p><p>In time Mr. Knipfel does learn to deal with his blindness, just as he learned to deal with his seizures. With the help of his ''home survival trainer'' (who gives him a talking clock and oven mitts that cover his arms) and ''the cane lady'' (who teaches him how to get around the city), he slowly recovers his feisty independence. He recounts the bizarre tale of enrolling in a track safety program that is meant to teach blind people how to survive a fall onto the subway tracks. And he provides a bitter but darkly comic account of his efforts to deal with the competing agencies set up to help the blind.</p><p>Some of Mr. Knipfel's anecdotes sound overly polished, like the sort of anecdotes performers tell and retell on talk shows. And his writing occasionally slips into cliche. ''Some people drink because it's Christmas Eve and they want to celebrate,'' he observes. ''Others drink just because it's Christmas Eve.'' A couple of pages later, he declares that he ''was born with an infant's body and a 100 year old's spirit.'' Such lapses, however, are rare in a book that displays remarkable elan and some wicked black humor in chronicling ''the weirdness parade'' that has been Mr. Knipfel's life.</p><p>Photo: Jim Knipfel (Debbie Egan-Chin/Putnam)</p>                </div>
