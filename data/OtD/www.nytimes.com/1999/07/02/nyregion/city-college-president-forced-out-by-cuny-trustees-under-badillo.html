                    <p>Yolanda T. Moses resigned under pressure yesterday as president of the City College, just days after the trustees of the City University of New York decided they needed a stronger leader for the struggling campus, members of the CUNY board said.</p><p>It was the second significant move taken this week by the board of trustees under Herman Badillo, who was named CUNY chairman at the end of May with a mandate to shake up the system.</p><p>In 1993, as a CUNY trustee, Mr. Badillo was the only member of the board to vote against the appointment of Dr. Moses to the City College post, and her resignation comes after she received a critical performance review.</p><p>City College was founded in 1847 as the Free Academy. It drew poor but bright students from New York's striving immigrant classes who were barred from the nation's best colleges, and became known as the ''poor man's Harvard,'' transforming its students into Nobel laureates and chief executives.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But as Mr. Badillo and his allies on the board have pressed for change, City College appeared to be one campus that was particularly vulnerable.  In a letter to Christoph M. Kimmich, CUNY's interim chancellor, that was released by the university yesterday evening, Dr. Moses said she would step down as president effective Sept. 1 for ''academic and personal reasons.''</p><p>She added, ''I believe that a smooth transition will be in the best interests of the City College community.''</p><p>Dr. Moses, an anthropologist who is also a tenured faculty member at City College, did not return telephone calls to her office and her home yesterday seeking comment.</p><p>The resignation of Dr. Moses is the latest sign that the CUNY board is moving swiftly to reshape the university -- including appointing new top managers -- since Mr. Badillo was named chairman. On Monday, the trustees approved the appointment of a permanent president for Hostos Community College, and Mr. Badillo is trying hard to recruit a new permanent chancellor.</p><p>The former chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, left nearly two years ago after repeated battles with the trustees, and the post has been filled by Dr. Kimmich.</p><p>Mr. Badillo did not return telephone calls to both his office and his home seeking comment last evening.</p><p>With open admissions and more students seeking to go to college, the City College today draws a student body from a wider academic spectrum than in its heyday. In 1997, more than 70 percent of its entering freshmen failed one or more of the university's placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics. Only 3 of CUNY's 11 senior colleges had a higher rate of failure.</p><p>In teacher education, City College students also appear to do poorly. The college's students have one of the lowest passing rates on New York State's teacher education examinations, compared with students both within the CUNY system and throughout the state.</p><p>Although City College's reputation had become tarnished long before Dr. Moses arrived in 1993, and its strengths in areas like science, engineering and the humanities received scant attention, critics say she never seemed able to present a clear vision or strong leadership for the troubled campus in a time of budget-cutting and downsizing.</p><p>''Yolanda is a woman of talent, but she was probably in the wrong job,'' said James Watts, a City College history professor, echoing other faculty members.</p><p>''People wish her well,'' he added. ''But as a manager, she neither did the external job of raising big bucks or repairing our reputation, nor did she provide the internal leadership.''</p><p>William Crain, a City College psychology professor, said that the mood among faculty members yesterday was mixed. ''Whatever people thought about the job she did, it seems cold to move her out so quickly and suddenly,'' he said.</p><p>Dr. Moses' resignation yesterday followed an unpublicized decision by the trustees on Monday evening in executive session to seek her departure, several trustees said.</p><p>Their decision came after they received what some trustees described as a critical review of her performance by a panel of outside evaluators.</p><p>CUNY policy calls for outside reviews of each college president every five years.</p><p>The university has not selected a successor yet, but is expected to seek an interim president from within the system.</p><p>At the time Dr. Moses was hired, campus leaders spoke of the need for someone who could rescue and rehabilitate the school's reputation -- a hard job under the best of circumstances, but made more difficult in a time of shrinking budgets.</p><p>Some faculty members say that her administrative experience did not begin to prepare her for the difficult task of leading a complex research institution in such a highly politicized environment. She had been vice president for academic affairs from California State University in Dominguez Hills, a largely black suburb of Los Angeles.</p><p>Under Dr. Moses, City College renovated six of its landmark buildings and its school of engineering. Like many of CUNY's other colleges, it also sought to raise admissions standards and improve teacher training.</p><p>And just this week, the college received the board's permission for a new doctoral program in biomedical engineering.</p><p>One of Dr. Moses' particular successes, said John Graziano, a City College music professor and chairman of the City College Senate, was in building links to local community organizations. ''I was at one community event recently where someone said she was the first City College president they had gotten to know,'' he said.</p><p>But like many others, he said that the college itself did not run smoothly. He noted, for example, that when CUNY administrators asked the colleges to designate people for performance excellence awards, the Hunter College list came out in mid-February, while the City College list became snagged in procedural problems and did not come out until late April.</p><p>''That's not a major thing,'' he said. ''But it goes to the functioning of the university, and it was symptomatic of the problems we have had.''</p><p>Photo: Dr. Yolanda T. Moses became president of City College in 1993. (Chang W.
