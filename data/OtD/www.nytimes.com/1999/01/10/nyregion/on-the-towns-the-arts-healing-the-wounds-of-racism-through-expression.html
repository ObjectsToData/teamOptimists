                    <p>A CONNECTION between Newark and next month's PBS broadcast of ''I'll Make Me a World,'' an examination of black contributions to American culture, may have been a marriage made in heaven.</p><p>The scheduled broadcast of the six-hour  series comes at a time when the city is still awash in the enthusiasm generated by the success of the year-old New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the hopes it has fueled for a broader revitalization of the city. It also coincides with a movement within the city to get in closer touch with Newark's rich artistic roots, and to view the city anew despite its image as a troubled urban area.</p><p>''It is a depressed area, but we all know that as far as the culture and art is concerned, it is not depressed, but very rich,'' said Faith Ringgold, a visual artist in nearby Englewood. ''It is important that Newark know that they may not have much money, but they have great art and artists.''</p><p>Getting that message out is the goal of the Newark Coalition for ''I'll Make Me a World,'' consisting of local arts groups, colleges, foundations and artists who have arranged nearly two months of events promoting the show and Newark's artistic heritage. The coalition includes the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Historical Society, Seton Hall University, the New Community Corporation, Aljira: A Center for Contemporary Art and WBGO-FM.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The events, which begin today and run through February, range from art exhibitions and jazz concerts to lectures, films and radio programs. The events will highlight not only the contributions of artists like Ms. Ringgold, Amiri Baraka, Sarah Vaughan and Paul Robeson, who are prominently featured in the series, but also the work of local artists who are not, like the Montclair jazz musician and composer Steve Colson, and the photographers Bill May and Mansa Mussa and the painter Bisa Washington, all of Newark.</p><p>Newark is one of 11 communities nationwide that have received grants from national and local foundations to develop programs highlighting and promoting the series, produced by the award-winning documentarian Henry Hampton and his production company, Blackside Inc., in association with WNET, Channel 13. Mr. Hampton, who died in November, was the executive producer of the ''Eyes on the Prize,'' documenting the civil rights movement; ''America's War on Poverty''; ''The Great Depression'' and ''Malcolm X: Make it Plain.''</p><p>Robert Lovell, director of publishing, education and new media for Boston-based Blackside, said such local efforts were part of the the company's attempt to draw attention to its work amid the cacophony of offerings available on 65 cable television outlets, the Internet and other competing media. It was also a way of promoting partnerships between large cultural institutions with smaller, local African-American arts groups, as well as extending the educational uses to which the programming can be put -- both of which, he said, nicely dovetailed with the educational and cultural missions of foundations around the country.</p><p>In addition to foundation money assembled by Blackside, the Newark coalition received support for its programs from the New Jersey Council for the Humanities and the Morristown-based Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.</p><p>Two visits to Newark by Mr. Hampton over the last two years suggested the possibility of some synergy between the broadcasts and local concerns, coalition members said. Alexandra Christie, a program officer with the Dodge Foundation, recalled a program at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in October 1997 at which the foundation, which gave financial support to the documentary, was honoring Mr. Hampton.</p><p>''His being here inspired people to think about things locally,'' Ms. Christie recalled. ''The first thing he said to us from the stage was that he wanted to talk about memory and how you can't understand where you are going unless you understand where you have been. He saw things that no one else saw, and suddenly what he was doing and what so many of us wanted for Newark seemed a perfect match.''</p><p>Last year, Mr. Hampton returned to Newark to be honored by Aljira, a small art gallery and performance space, said Jane Stein, program coordinator at the Newark Museum. He met more people among the city's arts community and made more converts to the idea of promoting the documentary along with Newark's arts community and artists.</p><p>Sam Pollard, a co-executive producer of ''I'll Make Me a World,'' who with Ms. Ringgold will be part of today's start of the local coalition's promotional programs, said he hoped the series would draw attention to the arts' importance to any society. He recalled that the actor Ossie Davis, one of several artists featured and interviewed in the series, said art -- whether it was music, painting, literature, dance or other performances -- was a way for black people to find out who they were as they struggled to overcome racism and the other consequences of their history as slaves.</p><p>''He saw the arts as being like a breath of fresh air,'' said Mr. Pollard, interpreting Mr. Davis. ''So we are not only trying to highlight heroes of the past but encourage people to take a look at the people in their community who are contributing artistically today.''</p><p>I'LL MAKE ME A WORLD</p><p>More than 20 events in conjunction with the PBS series.
