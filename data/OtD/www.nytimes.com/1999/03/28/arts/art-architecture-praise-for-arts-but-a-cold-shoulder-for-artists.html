    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="IT wasn't long ago that artists were welcomed and embraced in the nation's capital as well as in the mainstream news media. I vividly recall a reception called by John Brademas, then majority whip of the House, in a majestic room on the Hill in the late 1970's. The artists were lined up on one side -- they included Robert Rauschenberg, George Segal, James Rosenquist and a younger, post-Pop Art tribe that included video-performance-conceptualists like me. The whip introduced us to the other side, an assembled throng of Senators and Representatives. One of them was Edward I. Koch, then a New York Congressman. I shook his hand and expressed my sorrow that SoHo, where I live, was excluded from his district. ''If you live in SoHo,'' he told me, eyes gleaming, ''I am your Congressman in spirit.''    No such words are spoken in public these days. In a decade when unconventional artists (including writers, performers and musicians) have literally been smeared with chocolate, as well as charged with raiding the national treasury and subverting heterosexual family values, we're political poison. It's difficult to find a good word said on the floor of Congress on behalf of our individual contributions to the civil society, though the arts themselves are constantly praised.   ">

The artists were lined up on one side -- they included Robert Rauschenberg, George Segal, James Rosenquist and a younger, post-Pop Art tribe that included video-performance-conceptualists like me. The whip introduced us to the other side, an assembled throng of Senators and Representatives. One of them was Edward I. Koch, then a New York Congressman.

In a decade when unconventional artists (including writers, performers and musicians) have literally been smeared with chocolate, as well as charged with raiding the national treasury and subverting heterosexual family values, we're political poison. It's difficult to find a good word said on the floor of Congress on behalf of our individual contributions to the civil society, though the arts themselves are constantly praised.</p><p>Yes, there are faint signs of revivalism now: declarations of support for artists' teaching in public schools, where they seem to boost S.A.T. scores; a stamp dedicated to Jackson Pollock; the President's doubling Federal aid to the arts in his budget. But they are pale reflections beside the vintage gleam in Ed Koch's eyes.</p><p>The same paradox greets us in the news media. Despite consistently growing cultural coverage, the vanguard artist is often portrayed as an engaging roue at best, as psychotic at worst. Reams of copy are devoted to the charges against Karen Finley (the chocolate-smeared woman), Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, as well as the 1994 performance in Minneapolis where the artist Ron Athey allegedly ''sprayed'' H.I.V.-infected blood on the audience. But their ideas -- Mr. Serrano, for example, intended his crucifix submerged in urine as a criticism of commercial exploitation, not of religion -- are rarely examined. Neither do we usually get an accurate account of controversial art events: in Minneapolis, the ''spray-off'' actually consisted of strips of cloth daubed with small amounts of noninfected blood and stretched on a rope above the audience.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Let me testify that this is a departure from the progressive trend that prevailed in the late 60's. When I joined Newsweek as a critic in 1970, the editors actually welcomed my insistence on explaining rather than denigrating the avant-garde. These were also the years when the budget for the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities gradually increased, jump-started by President Nixon and Leonard Garment, his friend and adviser. Thus the nation benefited from an imaginative series of programs that directly aided artists, particularly those working in new media or in poor rural and working-class districts. Less than one year from the new century, however, Congress continues to forbid the awarding of Federal dollars directly to artists. Some states, several private foundations and a number of large corporations are following suit.</p><p>Why have we decided to reject a group that has brought so much renown -- to say nothing of tourist gold -- to our society? At a time when Americans are more actively engaged in seeing and making art than ever? Museum attendance is up. Art galleries and alternative performance-art spaces sprouted in every American town and city in the 70's and 80's, only falling on hard times of late. Per capita prosperity has gone through the roof in this decade. And more Americans travel, take college-level courses (including art history) and buy original art than ever before.</p><p>By overwhelming margins, parents tell us they want more, not less, arts in the schools. We have twice elected a President whose formal commitment to the National Endowments is passionate, however mixed his performance while under siege from a Republican majority determined to end cultural beneficence. But Princeton University's respected Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies reports in its latest working paper, ''Public Opinion and Political Vulnerability: Why Has the National Endowment for the Arts Been Such an Attractive Target?,'' that most Americans approve Government financing for the arts -- but not for  their practitioners.</p><p>We thus face an absurd contradiction that begs deconstruction on some level beyond political posturing and sound biting. It's far too easy to blame this crisis on the excesses of an avant-garde lately run wild, in the repetitive manner of Sen. Jesse Helms and his allies. The avant-garde has always offended -- temporarily -- the mainstream, which one generation or so later begins to pay huge sums for its works. This cyclical progress began with Manet and the Impressionists. Pollock, now nearing Walt Whitman in popular reverie, enraged mainstream America in the 1950's: when I was a kid in school, Time magazine called him ''Jack the Dripper.''</p>                </div>
