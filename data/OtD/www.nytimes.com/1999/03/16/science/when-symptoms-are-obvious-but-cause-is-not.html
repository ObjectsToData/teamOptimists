Researchers expected that a cause would soon be identified -- a virus, bacterium or toxic agent -- that would account for these complaints. It never happened.    Instead, through subsequent decades, a host of disorders with similar sets of symptoms were identified. They included so-called ''effort syndrome'' that afflicted veterans of the Civil War and World War I, chronic brucellosis, hypoglycemia, myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic candidiasis and chronic mononucleosis.

Making matters worse is a widespread but erroneous view that they are not really sick but are fakers or hypochondriacs whose symptoms are self induced to gain attention, sympathy or relief from their usual duties.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But the professional debate is not over whether the symptoms are real -- those affected are definitely sick, experts say -- but rather whether there is any point in continuing a thus far fruitless search for specific causes. A more productive approach, they say, would be to treat these syndromes as one and the same and provide effective treatment regardless of the cause.</p><p>In a recent issue of the journal Epidemiologic Reviews, Capt. Kenneth C. Hyams, who heads the epidemiology division of the Naval Medical Research Center in Bethesda, Md., noted the remarkable similarities in the symptom complexes that are the hallmarks of these diagnoses. All are characterized by fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, muscle or joint pain, impaired memory and often depression and/or anxiety, with some individual variations.</p><p>The unifying fact of all these disorders is that they are defined only by their subjective symptoms. No objective criteria or consistent organic explanation can be found for any of them and, therefore, they are a challenge to study, diagnose and treat. For example, Dr. Hyams explained that some patients might be found to have an immunological deficit, but many others with the very same deficit were not sick.</p><p>For others, the illness may have been preceded by a cold or flu, but there is no evidence that the infectious virus still lingers in any form.</p><p>A more probable explanation, Dr. Hyams and others suggest, is that a reaction to some physical or emotional stress triggers the symptoms that characterize these syndromes.</p><p>Faced with a lack of objective diagnostic criteria, the particular diagnosis a patient receives typically depends upon the patient's most disturbing symptom, the history of exposures the patient reports and the type of health professional seen -- allergist, gastroenterologist, rheumatologist, neurologist or psychiatrist.</p><p>As Dr. Simon Wessely, professor of psychological medicine and director of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome unit at Kings College in London, pointed out in an interview, ''Each specialty goes its own way in arriving at a diagnosis.'' In other words, patients who see a neurologist may get a diagnosis of nerve damage whereas those who see a rheumatologist may get a diagnosis involving joint or muscle pain.</p><p>He added: ''Doctors have been searching for the Holy Grail to explain these syndromes for the last 150 years without success. Neither single organic causes -- viruses, immune defects, toxic agents -- nor single psychological causes -- childhood sexual abuse, depression or anxiety -- can account for them.''</p><p>Dr. Wessely said that trying to categorize these ailments as either organic or psychiatric was a disservice to patients. ''If a patient is told the problem is due to a permanent deficit in the immune system or a persistent virus or chronic disability of the nerves or brain, this just generates helplessness and the patient becomes a victim,'' he said. ''And if you say the problem is psychological, this generates anger on the part of patients who don't regard psychological ills as legitimate.''</p><p>Rather, Dr. Wessely insisted: ''Looking for any single cause misses the point. Regardless of how or why they may have started, these syndromes are multifactorial, like heart disease.''</p><p>Dr. Hyams emphasized that the lack of objective diagnostic criteria ''does not mean that these people don't have problems.''</p><p>''They're ill,'' he said. ''There's no question. They are not malingerers.''</p><p>For example, Dr. Wessely said, ''Going to the Persian Gulf definitely affected the health of servicemen. We showed very considerable health effects. But that doesn't mean the disease they contracted is unique to science. They have legitimate health problems, but there is no single illness or single cause.''</p><p>Viewing the problems holistically, Dr. Hyams said: ''Even if these illnesses were primarily psychiatric, psychiatric illnesses have an organic basis in the mind. If a person is sick in any one place, it affects the whole body. For example, a psychiatric illness can cause changes in life style that can have profound physiological effects.''</p><p>Dr. Elaine Showalter, professor of humanities at Princeton University and author of ''Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Media'' (Columbia University Press, 1998), said her analysis of the history of these disorders demonstrated that they represented ''a basic human phenomenon -- the way people react to various stresses, with symptoms that are not organically based.''</p><p>''The symptoms are genuinely experienced, debilitating and absolutely real, but a lot of energy and money have been spent looking for organic explanations and treatments for what is basically a psychological phenomenon that is not caused by a virus, nerve gas, immune defect or any other tissue change,'' she said.</p><p>Dr. Hyams said, ''You always find high rates of these kinds of symptoms in any population reported to have been exposed to something.''</p><p>''People,'' he added, ''are sensitized by reported health threats if they think they've been exposed.''</p><p>The most effective treatment to date for the syndromes, Dr. Wessely said, is outlined in a report on chronic fatigue syndrome issued two years ago by the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Psychiatrists and General Practitioners. It is intended to deal with factors that perpetuate illness.</p><p>Dr. Wessely explains that the profound fatigue and muscle pain that typify these syndromes are best treated by a graded series of exercises to increase stamina. Also, patients are encouraged to shed their beliefs (for example, that any activity will make matters worse) and to restructure their approach to life through 12 weeks of behavioral therapy, intended to enhance self-confidence and a belief in a patient's ability to control his illness. If patients are suffering from serious depression or anxiety, temporary treatment with psychoactive drugs may also be offered, but as a therapeutic aid, not a cure.</p><p>Photo (Victoria Kann)</p>                </div>
