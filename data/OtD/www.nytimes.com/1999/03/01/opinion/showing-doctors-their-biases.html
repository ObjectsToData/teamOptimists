In reality they were actors, four black and four white, who described identical symptoms of chest pain. A videotape of them was later shown to 720 doctors.    The ''patients'' were presented in the same settings and given comparable occupations and medical-insurance status. The only differences among them were their race, age and sex. Each doctor was asked to estimate the likelihood that a patient had a narrowing of the coronary arteries and then, based on results of a stress test, to say whether the patient should be referred to a cardiologist for a catheterization. An analysis of the responses confirmed what previous studies have also suggested: women and blacks were 40 percent less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization than whites and men.   ">

An analysis of the responses confirmed what previous studies have also suggested: women and blacks were 40 percent less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization than whites and men.</p><p>For the researchers, the findings suggest that doctors have biases that ''may represent overt prejudice'' or, ''more likely, could be the result of subconscious perceptions, rather than deliberate actions or thoughts.''</p><p>As a foreign-trained doctor who was fortunate enough to come to the United States in 1980, I do not find this revelation of bias in the patient-doctor relationship entirely surprising, particularly considering the bias and complex hierarchies within the system that determines where new doctors train. About a quarter of all physicians working in the United States are foreign medical graduates, or F.M.G.'s, most of whom had their training in inner-city hospitals that were for the most part shunned by American medical school graduates.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The influx of foreign doctors is driven by the manpower needs of these hospitals, which serve many minority communities. Their residency programs, particularly in less lucrative specialties like internal medicine and pediatrics, have a hard time attracting American medical graduates.</p><p>At the county hospital in El Paso where I work, for example, my medical students get wonderful clinical training, but when they graduate they rarely stay on with us for a primary-care residency. A residency like ours that provides excellent training yet depends on foreign-born doctors carries a stigma.</p><p>It is possible that F.M.G.'s as well as black physicians exhibit the same biases as their white peers; the New England Journal of Medicine study did not specifically address this issue. Still, the present two-tiered postgraduate system of medical education that perpetuates itself year after year is hardly an advertisement for a classless, egalitarian profession.</p><p>When Surgeon General David Satcher, who has long been committed to eliminating disparities in health care, was interviewed on ''Nightline'' about the recent study, he said that ''professional societies, medical schools and all levels of education of health professionals should be involved in helping to sensitize and educate physicians and other health professionals about this problem.'' But how exactly can we make budding doctors sensitive to their subconscious reactions to others? How can we keep a doctor's cultural stereotypes from affecting patient encounters, or even doctor-to-doctor encounters?</p><p>Students arrive at medical school with a tremendous ability to imagine a patient's suffering. Yet by their final year, there is a remarkable atrophy of that imagination. The specialized language of medicine robs patients of their individuality and reduces their narrative to something like: ''This 55-year-old black female was in her usual state of health until three days prior to admission when she experienced the sudden onset of substernal chest pain on exertion.''</p><p>Stripping the patient of a personal context reflects what Walker Percy called ''cowpaths'' -- the narrow ruts of language and thought that characterize professional training. Such language may be efficient and necessary for diagnosis, but it makes it difficult for us to put ourselves in a patient's shoes and to see each patient as unique or to see his or her suffering as universal, transcending race and sex.  It may also make doctors blind to our own prejudices.</p><p>How then to restore the students' ability to see people as unique? Most medical schools now have a bioethics and humanities curriculum. Many have full medical humanities departments. Clearly, teachers cannot force students to think and do the right thing. But interestingly, many schools have found that the study of literature is a remarkable way to restore humanism in medicine.</p><p>Students witness much carnage in a hospital, and medical training often promotes a certain machismo that discourages them from expressing emotion. I find that by reading and discussing ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich,'' for example, or William Carlos Williams's ''The Use of Force,'' or Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' senior students who are at first reluctant to engage in such nonscientific pursuits often have a catharsis of sorts, which brings insight into their patients' situations as well as their own.</p><p>Racial bias in health care must be corrected not by medical ombudsmen or by legislation (or not by these things alone), but by a focus on the individual -- individual patients and individual doctors. The secret of caring for the patient does not lie solely in technological innovations or in more medical-industrial complexes. In the words of Dr. Francis Weld Peabody, ''The secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.''</p>                </div>
