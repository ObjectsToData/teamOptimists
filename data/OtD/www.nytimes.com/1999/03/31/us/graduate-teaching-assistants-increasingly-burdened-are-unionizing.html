Shermer started the five-year process of earning a doctoral degree in medieval English from the University of California at Berkeley, her teaching responsibilities began almost immediately. Without any tutoring on how to teach, she was asked to lead a discussion group on Chaucer the next day.    ''It's like an entry-level position, but you're thrown in up to your neck,'' said Ms. Sherman, 28, who makes $1,300 a month for 20 hours a week teaching freshman composition; at the same time, she is finishing her thesis. ''It was scary. At least I knew the material, but I felt like I needed a lot more help.''  ">

''It was scary. At least I knew the material, but I felt like I needed a lot more help.''</p><p>Students like Ms. Shermer take on more than half the teaching load for undergraduates at the University of California and at the nation's other major public research institutions, a shift that in the last 20 years has doubled the percentage of teachers not on the full-time faculty. A study by the graduate student teachers' union at Yale University, released on Monday, concluded that part-time instructors and graduate students taught 70 percent of Yale's classes.</p><p>Graduate teaching assistants give lectures, hold discussion groups, conduct labs and grade papers. Such reliance on part-time instructors is a much-debated topic in academe and is fostering a climate of labor militancy on campuses nationwide.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Dissatisfaction among teaching assistants has led to union organizing at 18 public-school campuses, including the City University of New York and the University of Michigan. In a decision expected to help organizing efforts elsewhere, last week the Public Employment Relations Board in California ordered the University of California to allow union elections to take place at seven campuses by the school year's end. Earlier in the week, teaching assistants at the University of California at Los Angeles had overwhelmingly voted to join a United Auto Workers affiliate. University officials had previously refused to recognize a union.</p><p>''This is the prize they're after,'' said Judith S. Craig, an associate dean at the University of Wisconsin, where the first union of teaching assistants was formed in 1969.</p><p>For 16 years, California's premier public university has fought unionization by its 9,000 graduate students, two-thirds of whom have joined, union officials say. Support is strongest among students in humanities and social science. During the paper and exam crunch at the end of the semester in December, graduate students walked off the job in the first systemwide strike. The action brought pressure on university officials from state legislative leaders, who urged a settlement and union recognition. The new Governor, Gray Davis, was already on record supporting the union.</p><p>In late December, the employment relations board determined that teaching assistants should be considered employees and not students, and had the right to unionize. The board rejected an appeal last month.</p><p>Members of the newly created U.C.L.A. union, the Student Association of Graduate Employees, are most concerned about declining health benefits, the lack of an effective grievance procedure, workload distribution and enrollment fees that are not fully forgiven, said Constance M. Razza, a union spokeswoman.</p><p>Albert Carnesale, U.C.L.A.'s chancellor, who helped the United States  negotiate a missile treaty with the  Soviet Union, said negotiations over graduate students' concerns were  likely to be delicate.</p><p>''The difficulty will come in being able to separate academic from workplace issues,'' Mr. Carnesale said. ''It's not a trivial undertaking because the line is not a bright one.''</p><p>Ms. Craig, a member of the Wisconsin bargaining team, who wrote a dissertation on graduate student unions, said a union benefited the university by forcing faculty members to improve their supervision and evaluation of teaching assistants. It also meant that fair treatment did not rest on the good will of the faculty.</p><p>Among the drawbacks, she said, is an adversarial environment. Another is that a student-run collective-bargaining group is transient. A result is a constant redefinition of the union's aims over economic and academic issues. A collective-bargaining contract also takes away a department's ability to make hiring or workload exceptions when necessary, Ms. Craig said.</p><p>Unions have failed to raise most graduate-student salaries, said Cary Nelson, an English professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Pay that amounts to less than the minimum wage is not unusual. ''I find those salaries all the time,'' Professor Nelson said, citing the $1,125 the University of Nebraska at Kearney pays a graduate student to teach a three-month class meeting three times a week. He figures that amounts to $3.75 an hour.</p><p>Professor Nelson is drafting a bill of rights for graduate students. Its provisions include pay equal to 30 percent of median family income for a full year. He will urge its adoption in a June meeting of the American Association of University Professors, which has 44,000 members.</p><p>The Modern Language Association, the first academic group to help  graduate students and part-time instructors establish their claim statistically, plans to survey working conditions in English and language departments at all of the country's 3,500 colleges this fall.</p><p>''We hope historians and economists will take similar actions to reform their own workplaces,'' Professor Nelson said.</p><p>ON THE WEB</p><p>THE LEARNING NETWORK Free classroom resources for grades 6-12, including news summaries, a news quiz, daily lesson plans, and selections from past articles, are available on The New York Times Times Learning Network: www.nytimes.com/learning</p>                </div>
