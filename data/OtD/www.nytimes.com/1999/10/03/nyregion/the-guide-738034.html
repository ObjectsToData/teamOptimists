It's that lovable rascal Bugs Bunny, and his pals from the Warner Brothers cartoon factory who are on display at the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport until January 8.</p><p>Adults should not resist the urge to view this exhibition without the children, since these cartoons, with their convoluted, devilish plots, were always conceived more for adults than for children.</p><p>Roadrunner, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck and the rest of the barnyard from Merry Melodies and Looney Tunes will be there in their original forms as drawings, paintings, and cels -- the transparent celluloid images that became animated films, exhibiting the conceptual side of cartoonmaking that the public rarely gets to see.</p><p>The films, created by the Warner Brothers stable of cartoon directors including Chuck Jones, Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett and more than 100 artists, designers, writers, and technicians, are as popular today on television as they were 50 years ago.</p><p>The Barnum Museum, a red sandstone Romanesque building, is an architectural treat in itself. Situated at 820 Main Street, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Visiting hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., Sunday from noon to 4:30.</p><p>Admission is $5, $4 for older people and college students, $3 for children 4 through 18.
