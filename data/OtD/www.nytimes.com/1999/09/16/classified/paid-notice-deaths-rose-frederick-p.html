	data-description="ROSE-Frederick P., master builder and creative philanthropist, son of Samuel B. and Belle B. Rose, died at home on Wednesday, September 15, 1999. Husband of Sandra Priest Rose, father of Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose; brother of Daniel and Elihu; grandfather of Ariel, Rachel and Sarah leaves a legacy of enormous love, warm friendships and immense generosity. His joy of life was expressed in his work and play. The service will be held at Westchester Reform Temple, 255 Mamaroneck Road, Scarsdale, NY, on Sunday, September 19, 1999 at 10AM. The family requests no flowers, and is not receiving visitors.    ROSE-Frederick P. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are greatly saddened by the passing of Frederick P. Rose, an extraordinary philanthropist and cherished friend of the Jewish community. He will be deeply missed. As a compassionate leader who embraced the philanthropic traditions of his exceptionally generous family, he enriched the lives of countless individuals through his devotion to Jewish causes, and his magnificent support of major cultural and educational institutions in New York and throughout the country. As a loving father, he has inspired a future generation of philanthropists through his exemplary efforts on behalf of the Jewish community. The naming of the Samuel Priest Rose Building, in memory of Mr. Rose's son, reflects the family's commitment to creating a permanent facility for the Jewish Community Center on the Upper West Side, and a lasting resource for a thriving, diverse Jewish population. The contributions of Mr. Rose and his wife, Sandra, will be felt for generations to come. Together, they have strengthened UJA-Federation's network of health and human-service agencies through their longtime leadership and their support of F.E.G.S., the Lexington School for the Deaf, the Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds, and The Mount Sinai Medical Center. From 1974 to 1977, Mr. Rose served as president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, a predecessor to UJA-Federation. He held numerous positions with UJA-Federation over the years. We extend our sincerest condolences to Sandra; to Mr. Rose's daughter, Dr. Deborah Rose, and his son-inlaw, Professor Jan Stolwijk; his son Jonathan and daughter-in-law, Diana; his son, Adam, and Peter McQuillan; his brother Daniel and Daniel's wife, Joanna; his brother Elihu and Elihu's wife, Susan; and the entire Rose family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.    ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The trustees and staff of the American Museum of Natural History are deeply saddened and shocked by the death of beloved trustee Frederick P. Rose. Few have given so unstintingly of themselves to make this city a more glorious place in which to live. The lives of all New Yorkers have been enriched by his extraordinary vision, integrity, and generosity. From the sciences and humanities to the performing arts, Fred Rose's wide-ranging and enlightened philanthropy has made all our lives brighter, our institutions stronger, and our city more vibrant. He was a unique New Yorker, a treasure who will be sorely missed. For all he has done for the Museum, for New York, and the world, and for his joy, enthusiasm, tenacity, professionalism, and expansive vision, we are deeply grateful. We are especially heartbroken that he was snatched from our midst on the eve of the opening of his extraordinary legacy, the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, which embodies his deep love of intellectual pursuit, great architecture, and fine design. His spirit will be with us for the opening and beyond. To his devoted wife and adored member of the Museum family Sandy, daughter Deborah, and sons Jonathan and Adam, we extend our most profound sympathies, and promise that Fred will always be with us in our thoughts. Farewell dear friend and colleague, we shall miss you but count you with us always in our hearts. Anne Sidamon-Eristoff, Chairman Ellen V. Futter, President American Museum of Natural History    ROSE-Frederick P. The Horace Mann Community is deeply saddened by the death of Frederick P. Rose HM'40, its cherished friend and former student, benefactor and dedicated philanthropist. Mr. Rose's discerning wisdom, his warm personality, his love of beautiful, well-crafted buildings, and his faith in the goodness of human beings will be missed beyond measure. It is a fitting tribute to Frederick Rose, to his family, and to his two brothers that the new Middle School at Horace Mann has been named Rose Hall. Generations of students and their families will benefit from this great legacy. The 1940 HM yearbook wrote: ''Ebullient Freddy bounced into Horace Mann as a Fourth Former. He sang in the Glee Club, reported for The Record, snapped photographs for The Mannikin, took notes as Secretary of the Debating Club, and played the accordion in the Music Club.'' Fred Rose's extraordinary intelligence and grace, his spirit and fortitude, and his exceptional generosity inspire us and will continue to inspire us here at Horace Mann. What he has bestowed on the School is a testament to his vision and his dedication. Cherished friend, we will miss you-a man of extraordinary talents. It was our great privilege to merit this continuing relationship with you. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, the former Sandra Priest, to his children, Deborah, Jonathan, HM'70, and Adam Raphael, HM'77 and to his brothers Daniel Rose HM'47, and Elihu Rose HM'50 and their families. Michael D. Hess '58 Chair, Board of Trustees Dr. Eileen Mullady Head of School    ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The Trustees and Staff of The New York Public Library are deeply saddened at the passing of Frederick Rose, beloved husband of our esteemed Trustee Sandra Priest Rose, and our dear friend and benefactor. For decades, Mr. Rose was a leader and supporter of educational and cultural institutions in New York City, combining his great skills as builder, businessman, and advocate with exceptional acts of philanthropy. At The New York Public Library, Mr. and Mrs. Rose were responsible for the restoration of the Deborah, Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest, and Adam Raphael Rose Main Reading Room, the symbolic heart of the institution, named for their children. In addition, they endowed the position of the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Chief Librarian of the General Research Division. Deeply committed to The Branch Libraries, the Roses also made possible the rehabilitation of the Library's Yorkville and Aguilar branches. Mr. Rose's legacy to the Library is a permanent one and we will miss his warmth and vitality. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Sandy; to their children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam; to his brothers, Daniel and Elihu; and to the entire Rose family. Samuel C.

All of us at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. deeply mourn the death of one of our most beloved friends, leaders, and benefactors, Frederick P. Rose. Unmatched in loyalty and commitment, Fred served Lincoln Center in every way imaginable: As a member of the Board of Directors since 1984, later as Vice Chairman of the Board, and on myriad committees and councils. Fred committed himself fully to every important Lincoln Center program and project. His vision, professional guidance, and unparalleled generosity were instrumental in the construction of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center, named after his father and uncle. For over a decade, he served on the Lincoln Center Real Estate and Construction Council where he was twice honored. Moreover, he was the recipient of the Lincoln Center Laureate, the greatest distinction we bestow. In memory of his mother, Belle, his philanthropy showed a special concern for people with visual disabilities. He also had a profound desire to bring the performing arts to the broadest possible audiences through his funding of Live from Lincoln Center telecasts. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife, Sandra, a full partner in his philanthropic and civic endeavors, and to his children, Deborah, Jonathan, and Adam, and to their friends and associates. We will miss his friendship, wit, wisdom, and leadership. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc.    ROSE-Frederick P. The Rockefeller University community deeply mourns the loss of our cherished friend and emeritus trustee Frederick P. Rose, an incomparable leader in the worlds of real estate and philanthropy. His generosity helped to shape many of New York City's academic, medical, and cultural institutions, including this one, where he established the Frederick P. Rose Professorship for a distinguished biologist. A member of The Rockefeller University Board of Trustees since 1984 and former chairman of its real estate committee, Fred Rose made lasting contributions to the University, helping to strengthen its research programs and modernize its physical plant. He was a wonderful advocate for the University and the work of its scientists and physicians. We will greatly miss him and forever cherish the memory of his enormous vitality, warmth, and wit. With heartfelt sorrow, we extend our condolences to his beloved wife, Sandra, and to the entire Rose family. Arnold J. Levine, President Torsten N. Wiesel, President Emeritus Joshua Lederberg, President Emeritus Richard B. Fisher, Chairman Richard M. Furlaud, Chairman Emeritus William O. Baker, Chairman Emeritus David Rockefeller, Honorary Chairman    ROSE-Frederick P. The Officers, Board of Trustees and Staff of The Asia Society note with great sadness the death of our former Trustee and beloved friend, Frederick P. Rose. For more than two decades, Fred Rose was a strong supporter of the Asia Society and its mission, in New York and beyond. He served as a member of the Board of Trustees from 1976 to 1982, and then again from 1994 to 1997 when he was also Chairman of the Nominating Committee. With his extensive knowledge of real estate, Fred Rose was instrumental in planning and constructing the Asia Society's present headquarters at 725 Park Avenue in the 1970's. He was also a guiding force for the planned renovation of this building in the coming year. In 1991, the Mr. and Mrs. Frederick P. Rose Room was formally dedicated on the 8th floor of the Asia Society building. The Rose Conference Hall was dedicated in 1995, further honoring the family's high philanthropic standards and generosity. Fred Rose's bold vision and wise counsel will be greatly missed and long remembered. To his wife, Sandra, and children, we offer our profound sympathy on their loss. Maurice R. Greenberg, Chairman of the Board Nicholas Platt, President The Asia Society    ROSE-Frederick P. The Board of Directors, staff and clients of F.E.G.S. mourn the passing of Frederick P.

Board of Directors. Fred and Sandy, through their generosity, made possible the Sandra P. and Frederick P. Rose F.E.G.S. Brooklyn Center located at 199 Jay Street in Brooklyn which has provided health related and social services to thousands of needy individuals. The entire Rose family has helped to set the standard for social responsibility and civic leadership. Because of their commitment, efforts and caring, millions of New Yorkers have been given opportunities that would otherwise not have been afforded them. To Sandy and the entire Rose family we offer our heartfelt condolences. Fred will be sorely missed. Joseph Stein, Jr., President/Chair, F.E.G.S. Alfred P. Miller, Executive VP/CEO, F.E.G.S.    ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of one of our most generous and beloved supporters.

He also gave generously of his time, serving on trustee committees for buildings, education, membership, and capital needs and was Founding Chairman of the Real Estate Counsel. His boundless energy and wise judgement has enriched this institution, and he will be greatly missed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Sandy, and to the entire Rose family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director David E. McKinney, President    ROSE-Frederick P. As a builder, visionary, and philanthropist, Frederick P. Rose created homes both for people and for extraordinary institutions that have enriched people's lives and enhanced the cultural, physical, and communal landscape of New York. We are privileged, and blessed, that he and his family chose to name the new home for the Jewish Community Center on the Upper West Side-the Samuel Priest Rose Building-to reflect the importance and value of building an inclusive Jewish community. We hope that all he has given will be a source of comfort to his family. His legacy of leadership is carried on through his children. Our hearts are with Sandra, Deborah, Jonathan, Adam, and their families. May his memory and the work of his life be a model and blessing for all of us. Harold R.

The officers, members, and staff of The American Jewish Committee are greatly saddened by the death of Fred Rose, an esteemed member of our President's Cabinet and National Leadership Council, and a former member of the Publication Committee of Commentary Magazine. Deeply touched by the recent suffering in the Balkans, he was a generous contributor to AJC's Kosovo Relief Fund, where his benevolence and compassion will surely be felt for years to come. His abiding love of the Jewish people and his unwavering dedication to bettering the lives of peoples everywhere is witnessed by his numerous philanthropic commitments. He has left for us all a shining and enduring legacy of human kindness.

The family requests no flowers, and is not receiving visitors.</p><p>ROSE-Frederick P. The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are greatly saddened by the passing of Frederick P. Rose, an extraordinary philanthropist and cherished friend of the Jewish community. He will be deeply missed. As a compassionate leader who embraced the philanthropic traditions of his exceptionally generous family, he enriched the lives of countless individuals through his devotion to Jewish causes, and his magnificent support of major cultural and educational institutions in New York and throughout the country. As a loving father, he has inspired a future generation of philanthropists through his exemplary efforts on behalf of the Jewish community. The naming of the Samuel Priest Rose Building, in memory of Mr. Rose's son, reflects the family's commitment to creating a permanent facility for the Jewish Community Center on the Upper West Side, and a lasting resource for a thriving, diverse Jewish population. The contributions of Mr. Rose and his wife, Sandra, will be felt for generations to come. Together, they have strengthened UJA-Federation's network of health and human-service agencies through their longtime leadership and their support of F.E.G.S., the Lexington School for the Deaf, the Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds, and The Mount Sinai Medical Center. From 1974 to 1977, Mr. Rose served as president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, a predecessor to UJA-Federation. He held numerous positions with UJA-Federation over the years. We extend our sincerest condolences to Sandra; to Mr. Rose's daughter, Dr. Deborah Rose, and his son-inlaw, Professor Jan Stolwijk; his son Jonathan and daughter-in-law, Diana; his son, Adam, and Peter McQuillan; his brother Daniel and Daniel's wife, Joanna; his brother Elihu and Elihu's wife, Susan; and the entire Rose family. Judith Stern Peck, Board Chair James S. Tisch, President Stephen D. Solender, Exec V.P.</p><p>ROSE-Frederick Phineas. The trustees and staff of the American Museum of Natural History are deeply saddened and shocked by the death of beloved trustee Frederick P. Rose. Few have given so unstintingly of themselves to make this city a more glorious place in which to live. The lives of all New Yorkers have been enriched by his extraordinary vision, integrity, and generosity. From the sciences and humanities to the performing arts, Fred Rose's wide-ranging and enlightened philanthropy has made all our lives brighter, our institutions stronger, and our city more vibrant. He was a unique New Yorker, a treasure who will be sorely missed. For all he has done for the Museum, for New York, and the world, and for his joy, enthusiasm, tenacity, professionalism, and expansive vision, we are deeply grateful. We are especially heartbroken that he was snatched from our midst on the eve of the opening of his extraordinary legacy, the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, which embodies his deep love of intellectual pursuit, great architecture, and fine design. His spirit will be with us for the opening and beyond. To his devoted wife and adored member of the Museum family Sandy, daughter Deborah, and sons Jonathan and Adam, we extend our most profound sympathies, and promise that Fred will always be with us in our thoughts. Farewell dear friend and colleague, we shall miss you but count you with us always in our hearts. Anne Sidamon-Eristoff, Chairman Ellen V. Futter, President American Museum of Natural History</p><p>ROSE-Frederick P. The Horace Mann Community is deeply saddened by the death of Frederick P. Rose HM'40, its cherished friend and former student, benefactor and dedicated philanthropist. Mr. Rose's discerning wisdom, his warm personality, his love of beautiful, well-crafted buildings, and his faith in the goodness of human beings will be missed beyond measure. It is a fitting tribute to Frederick Rose, to his family, and to his two brothers that the new Middle School at Horace Mann has been named Rose Hall. Generations of students and their families will benefit from this great legacy. The 1940 HM yearbook wrote: ''Ebullient Freddy bounced into Horace Mann as a Fourth Former. He sang in the Glee Club, reported for The Record, snapped photographs for The Mannikin, took notes as Secretary of the Debating Club, and played the accordion in the Music Club.'' Fred Rose's extraordinary intelligence and grace, his spirit and fortitude, and his exceptional generosity inspire us and will continue to inspire us here at Horace Mann. What he has bestowed on the School is a testament to his vision and his dedication. Cherished friend, we will miss you-a man of extraordinary talents. It was our great privilege to merit this continuing relationship with you. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, the former Sandra Priest, to his children, Deborah, Jonathan, HM'70, and Adam Raphael, HM'77 and to his brothers Daniel Rose HM'47, and Elihu Rose HM'50 and their families.
