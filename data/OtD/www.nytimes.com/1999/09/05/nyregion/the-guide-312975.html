                    <p>An opportunity to be the first to visit the 95 percent-restored Faulkner's Island Lighthouse and wildlife refuge off Guilford will occur on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.</p><p>People who have their own boats must anchor west of the Guilford wharf basin and wait with non-boat-owners for the water taxi service to the island. Due to the limited capacity of the island's landing wharf, the large flotilla of vessels expected for this occasion will not be allowed to land there.</p><p>Faulkner's Island Lighthouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was commissioned by  Thomas Jefferson in 1802. The island itself is the seasonal home of the largest colony of roseate terns in the world, and a migratory stopover for more than 150 additional species of birds.</p><p>The restoration, made possible with a $250,000 matching grant from the State Department of Transportation, has been accomplished under the direction of Walter Sedovic, architect, and implemented by International Chimney Corporation, movers of the Cape Hatteras Light. The project is administered by the Town of Guilford and Faulkner's Island Brigade, a private sponsoring group.</p><p>Saturday's open house visitors will be welcomed by Bill Kolodnicki, refuge manager; Dr. Jeffrey Spendelow and his staff from the Falkner Island Tern Project; members of the Faulkner's Island Brigade, and the United States Coast Guard. Picnicking is permitted but campfires and dogs are not. There is a bathroom but no fresh water.</p><p>Because it is not feasible to land at the island in high winds or sustained rain, inclement weather will postpone the event until the next day, Sunday. For an updated weather report, call (203) 453-1111 before setting out on Saturday.</p><p>PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIES</p><p>A little known area of 19th-century photography is featured in an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, titled ''Early Photography in the Amistad Foundation Collection.'' It may be seen through the month of October.</p><p>Within a few years of the first daguerrotypes made in 1839 by Louis-Jacques Mande, two African-Americans, Augustus Washington of Hartford and James Presley Ball of Cincinnati, began producing photographic studies. Their clientele was mostly white active abolitionists or people in sympathy with the anti-slavery movement.</p><p>Examples of their work and that of the many African-American photographers who followed in their footsteps include include portraits of Sojourner Truth and Booker T. Washington as well as the writer William Wells Brown and the sculptor Edmonia Lewis.</p><p>Less well known but equally compelling are photographs of Flora Stewart, aged 117; someone called Dangerous Jack, and a parade of cowboys, prize fighters, actresses, Union troopers and ordinary people dressed in their Sunday best.</p><p>Tintypes, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes and, later, mechanically reproduced visiting cards are included in the display. The Amistad collection, begun in 1987, is made up of 6,000 items tracing African-American history and culture over 300 years.</p><p>The Atheneum, at 600 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $7, or $5 for students and people over 64, $3 for 6-  through 17-year-olds, and free for those under 6. Admission is free to everyone on Thursdays and until noon on Saturdays. Call (860) 278-2670 for more information.</p><p>ANTIQUES FAIR</p><p>Both the merchandise and the setting are venerable at the annual Redding Historical Society Antiques Fairs. The 24th such event is scheduled on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the society's headquarters, the Lonetown Farm Museum on Route 107.</p><p>The property -- built around 1778 by Esther Read, granddaughter of John Read, founder of the town -- is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was named Lonetown by Mr. Read, who acquired the land from the Indians and found life very lonely out there in the wilderness, said Lawrence Banks, the 88-year-old assistant town historian. In later years, Reading became Redding as the result of a spelling error.</p><p>At Saturday's fair, more than 100 dealers from the Northeast will be displaying large amounts of country and formal furniture, period accessories, quilts, china, fine art, baskets, and items known as whimsies in tents set up across the former onion fields.</p><p>Craft demonstrators in early American costumes will be stationed in the house, barn and yard, showing how redware pottery, baskets, tinware, ironware, cloth and Shaker boxes were made. Visitors will be entertained by some serious bagpiping, performed in kilts and sporrans by the Thistle Pipers.</p><p>Food will be available for purchase all day, provided by the Men's Club of the First Church of Christ Congregational. Admission will be $5, or $20 for early buyers at 8 A.M. The number to call for more information is (203) 894-1921.</p><p>ORGAN COMPETITION</p><p>The second annual Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival and National Organ Competition for high school and college students will be held on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday at the First Church of Christ in Old Wethersfield. Sponsored in cooperation with the Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities, it is modeled after its European counterpart, offering awards and recognition for young organists.</p><p>A 50-minute multimedia presentation on Friday at 7:30 will feature Thurston Moore's ''Words of Albert Schweitzer and the Music of Bach,'' presented in slides, with narration by radio personalities and church officials, and in concert by the First Church choirs and organist.</p><p>High school competitors will perform from 9 A.M. to noon on Saturday, followed by the college competition from 2 to 5 P.M. Winners, who will receive awards of $250 to $2,000, will give a recital on Sunday at 4 P.M. in the church meetinghouse. Judges include the guest organists Dr. Frederick Hohman of South Bend, Ind.; Dr. Catherine Rodland of West Hartford, and David Spicer, minister of music at First Church in Wethersfield.</p><p>The annual festivals celebrate Dr. Schweitzer's musicianship and his writings on the works of Johann Sebastian Bach as an inspiration for young organists. Spectators are welcome to attend all sessions free of charge, but offerings will be received at the Friday and Sunday events.</p><p>The church is at 250 Main Street and the number for more information is (860) 563-7759.
