                    <p>''Many years ago, when I began my theological studies at Harvard Divinity School, I attended the opening convocation of the Divinity School. My classmates and I were eager to sit at the feet of the wise, and grateful to God and Harvard for admitting us. It was, so we thought, no small privilege to listen to the address given that day by the faculty's most senior professor, the Hollis Professor of Divinity. We listened intently, as intently as you are now listening to me. And at the end, when it was all over, none of us had understood a word he had said. Were we distressed, alarmed, annoyed? Not at all. We were at Harvard. We expected to understand nothing.''</p><p>SKIDMORE COLLEGE</p><p>THOMAS LEWIS</p><p>Professor of English, Skidmore</p><p>''As much as anyone, William Mulholland is responsible for modern-day Los Angeles. He created 67 dams and aqueducts that bring water to the desert where that city now stands. Once when he was asked to speak at the opening of one of his aqueducts, Mulholland is reported to have said just five words: Here's your water. Use it.''</p><p>HAMILTON COLLEGE</p><p>HENRY LOUIS GATES JR.</p><p>Professor of Humanities, Harvard</p><p>''My father called me in to see him about a week before school started and we sat down and he said, 'Boy, you're going over to that white school,' as we called it, 'and there's an important thing you have to understand.' He said, 'There's two kinds of white people.' And I said, 'Two kinds of white people? How do you tell the difference?' He said, 'That's easy. There's two kinds of white people, the Irish and the Italian, and this is how you tell the difference.' He said the Irish have names that begin with 'o' and the Italians have names that end with 'o.' And that, ladies and gentlemen, has been the secret to my success all these years later.''</p><p>UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA</p><p>ROBERT E. RUBIN</p><p>Secretary of the Treasury</p><p>''When my father was in college, he had signed up for a course in philosophy with a renowned professor. On the first day of class, the professor debated the question of whether you could prove that the table at the front of the room existed. My father is very bright and very pragmatic. He went to the front of the room, pounded on the table with his hand, decided it was there -- and promptly dropped the course. My view is quite the opposite. I believe there are no absolutes. If there are no absolutes, then all decisions become matters of judging the probability of different outcomes, and the costs and benefits of each. On that basis, you can make a good decision.''</p><p>BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC</p><p>DAVID BOWIE</p><p>Musician</p><p>''During the very early days of Ziggy Stardust, we often used to play these fairly grotty clubs called the 'workingman's clubs.' They were sort of like nightclubs but you got a cheap meal. Well, backstage one night I was desperate to use the bathroom. I was dressed in my full battle finery of Tokyo-spaceboy and a pair of shoes high enough that it induced nose bleeds. I went up to the promoter and I asked, 'Could you please tell me where the lavatory is?' And he said, 'On the far end of that wall. You see that sink? There you go.' I said, 'My good man.' He said, 'Listen son, if it's good enough for Shirley Bassey, it's good enough for you.' From which I learned that mixing elements of bad taste with good would often produce the most interesting results.''</p><p>MOORE COLLEGE OF ART AND DESIGN</p><p>KAREN A. HARMAN</p><p>Vice president, Dana Buchman</p><p>''Corporations have become the modern Medicis for us all. When they buy our art, it is not the result of aristocratic whim or taste but because it carries a broker's assurance of a good investment.''</p><p>UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT</p><p>DAVID McCULLOUGH</p><p>Historian</p><p>''Information has become an industry, a commodity to be packaged, promoted and marketed incessantly. The tools for 'accessing' data grow ever more wondrous and ubiquitous and essential if we're to keep in step, we've come to believe. All hail the Web, the Internet, the Information Highway. We're being sold the idea that information is learning, and we're being sold a bill of goods. Information isn't learning. It isn't common sense necessarily. It isn't kindness. Or trustworthiness. Or good judgment. Or imagination. Or a sense of humor. Or courage. It doesn't tell us right from wrong.''</p><p>AMERICAN UNIVERSITY</p><p>BARRY LEVINSON</p><p>Film maker</p><p>''Television breeds a certain degree of cynicism. When we point the camera at any institution, it is less than what we hoped it to be. Let's use D-Day as an example. That was considered a shining hour where people sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Europe for democracy. Now, say television was there on the beach on D-Day. What would we report? Equipment broke down, soldiers were confused, some died by friendly fire, some couldn't reach their objective. What was wrong? Where were the mistakes? We would want investigations, we would want inquiries, we would recall General Eisenhower. Maybe he should be court-martialed?''</p><p>WHEATON COLLEGE</p><p>NATHAN HATCH</p><p>Provost, University of Notre Dame</p>                </div>
