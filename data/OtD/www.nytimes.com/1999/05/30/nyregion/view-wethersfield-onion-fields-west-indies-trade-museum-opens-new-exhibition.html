    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="AS one of the earliest settlements in Connecticut, Wethersfield has always cherished its role in the state's history and understood the importance of preserving the landmarks of its past. To provide visitors with an overview of the town's heritage and direct them to its historic sites, the Wethersfield Historical Society developed a permanent exhibition entitled ''Legendary People, Ordinary Lives,'' which is at the Wethersfield Museum.     ''We were anxious to examine the major themes in Wethersfield history and to showcase a major portion of our collection,'' said the society's executive director, Brenda Milkofsky, who created the show in cooperation with the curator Beverly Johnson. ''The exhibition was timed so the society could make a contribution toward making Wethersfield a destination for heritage tourism.''  ">

                    <p>AS one of the earliest settlements in Connecticut, Wethersfield has always cherished its role in the state's history and understood the importance of preserving the landmarks of its past. To provide visitors with an overview of the town's heritage and direct them to its historic sites, the Wethersfield Historical Society developed a permanent exhibition entitled ''Legendary People, Ordinary Lives,'' which is at the Wethersfield Museum.</p><p>''We were anxious to examine the major themes in Wethersfield history and to showcase a major portion of our collection,'' said the society's executive director, Brenda Milkofsky, who created the show in cooperation with the curator Beverly Johnson. ''The exhibition was timed so the society could make a contribution toward making Wethersfield a destination for heritage tourism.''</p><p>The show, which was paid for by a grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council and by gifts from supporters, traces the Wethersfield experience from when Indians inhabited the meadows along the Connecticut River, which they called the Great Tidal River, through the arrival of 10 English adventurers in 1634, the founding of the town, its growth as an agricultural and maritime center and, in this century, its transformation into an attractive suburban community.</p><p>More than 100 of the historical society's artifacts are on display: paintings, tools, maps and furniture from the workshops of the town's renowned cabinetmakers -- desks, chests and chairs greatly esteemed by today's collectors and museums.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The exhibition includes a 1690's chest with drawers, carved with a sunflower and tulip blossom motif, a design attributed to the well-known joiner Peter Blin. Another standout is a 1754 scroll-pedimented doorway removed from the home of the merchant mariner, Capt. Charles Churchill. These doorways, typical of the Connecticut River Valley, were considered a mark of the owner's high social standing.</p><p>Printed on the cover of a wooden box is the following legend: ''Greetings to Old Wethersfield from Older Windsor.'' A gift received during the 1930's, it held a copy of the history of Windsor and testifies to the age-old dispute between the two towns, both founded in the 1630's, as to which is the oldest in the state.</p><p>The objects on display are accompanied by explanatory text, by interactive exhibitions and by panels entitled ''Sign Posts to History'' that highlight sites of historic and artistic interest, many within walking distance of the museum.</p><p>The choice is ample. Decades ago, organizations like the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, the National Society of the Colonial Dames and the Wethersfield Historical Society bought and restored buildings including the 17th-century Buttolph-Williams House, the 18th-century Joseph Webb House and the 19th-century Hurlbut-Dunham House and continue to operate them as museums. In 1962, two square miles in the center of town were set aside as a historic district encompassing 1,100 buildings -- the largest district in the state and a good place for a pleasant walking tour. One of the pioneers in the preservation movement, and one of the ''Legendary People'' in the show's title, was Wallace Nutting (1861-1941), described as ''minister, collector, photographer, reproduction furniture maker, house restorer, lecturer and icon of the Colonial Revival movement.''</p><p>Nutting purchased a ''Chain of Colonial Houses'' throughout New England, restored them -- often in ways that make today's purists turn pale -- and sold them to individuals or organizations. The Webb House, across the street from the museum, was one of them, the first Wethersfield home opened as a museum, in 1916. The setting of a conference between George Washington and the Count of Rochambeau in May 1781, it is now part of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, a rare complex of 18th-century houses still standing on their original sites.</p><p>As for the ''Ordinary Lives'' of the show's title, their tale is filled with episodes of creativity and courage.</p><p>Although it was the rich, stone-free valley soil that lured the first band of English settlers from Massachusetts, the settlement's site on a bend in the Connecticut River turned many of their descendants into mariners and ship builders.</p><p>The Tryal, built in 1649, was the first of almost 200 vessels built in local shipyards. The show presents sea chests, compasses and log books used on board ship as well as a print of the schooner Samuel, built in Wethersfield in 1795, portrayed off the coast of Naples two years later.</p><p>Fortunes were made in the West Indies trade, and also lost.</p><p>''Would you risk your fortune in the West Indies trade?'' asks one of the hands-on panels. ''Press the button and find out.''</p><p>Visitors can learn that they might get caught in the doldrums without wind and add two days to an already-long journey, or even turn turtle and sink, and never arrive at all.</p><p>Among the farmers presented in the show, some of the most successful were the growers of Wethersfield's celebrated red onions, which were shipped down the Connecticut River to ports in the South and West Indies, in exchange for molasses or English goods.</p><p>Onion growing was considered women's work; in the 18th and early 19th century, one third of the 500 people involved in the industry were women. The town's Onion Maidens became legend and a myth grew -- with no basis in fact -- that they wore silk dresses on Sunday and were considered ''the catch of the area.''</p><p>An engraving printed in London in 1781 shows four Onion Maidens tending their field, wearing straw bonnets of the type designed and patented by an entrepreneur, Sophia Woodhouse.</p><p>Mrs. Woodhouse's hats -- fashioned, it is said, in her own home by women workers -- became famous when one was presented to Mrs. John Quincy Adams and President Adams declared it ''an extraordinary specimen of American manufacture.''</p><p>As the onion trade waned during the 1840's, farmers sought to diversify. Some turned to dairy, some to crops like hay, potatoes and tobacco, some took up growing seed for the expanding nation. Over time, eight important seed companies operated in town. Nineteenth-century seed boxes with attractively designed packets of seed are on display, along with a sieve-like implement called a riddle, used to clean seeds.</p><p>Actually, two seed businesses remain in town. Comstock, Ferre &amp; Company and the Charles C. Hart Seed Company are still on Main Street, a short walk from the museum.</p><p>The Wethersfield Museum, 200 Main Street, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 4 P.M. Admission is $3, free to children under 16 and to Wethersfield residents.</p><p>Photos: An engraving printed in London in 1781 shows four women working in an onion field in Wethersfield.
