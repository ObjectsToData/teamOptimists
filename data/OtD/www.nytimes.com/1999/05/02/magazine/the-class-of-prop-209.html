    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="The campus of the university of california at berkeley in springtime is about as close to Shangri-La as most mortals are likely to get. When I paid a visit last month, the dogwoods and the cherry trees were in splendid bloom, and the broad, sunny plaza in front of the Mario Savio Steps at Sproul Hall was jammed with students. I had arrived during campaign season, and kids were milling around the plaza holding placards and bedsheets promising better, wiser, bolder student government. Berkeley must be one of the few universities with standing political parties, and several of the parties had set up booths. One of the loneliest of them, never staffed by more than a student or two, belonged to the Defend Affirmative Action Party.    A year earlier, when the ban on the use of affirmative action enacted by the Board of Regents of the university and confirmed by voters in Proposition 209 went into effect, freshman minority enrollment at Berkeley had been cut by half. Conservatives had got their wish, but it had led to precisely the disaster predicted by affirmative action's backers. It wouldn't have been surprising, then, if preferences were a roaring issue on campus. I asked a student if the Defend Affirmative Action Party had a chance of winning a seat in this spring's elections in the student government. He consulted a friend. ''Not really,'' he said. A poll taken at the time of Prop. 209 showed that in fact most students opposed affirmative action.  ">

Conservatives had got their wish, but it had led to precisely the disaster predicted by affirmative action's backers. It wouldn't have been surprising, then, if preferences were a roaring issue on campus. I asked a student if the Defend Affirmative Action Party had a chance of winning a seat in this spring's elections in the student government. He consulted a friend. ''Not really,'' he said. A poll taken at the time of Prop. 209 showed that in fact most students opposed affirmative action.</p><p>Across the plaza, one of the most popular parties, Calserve, was handing out fliers urging students to vote yes on Proposition 3, which, by contrast, was considered a shoo-in. It called for student fees to be increased by $3 in order to support outreach efforts to increase the flow of minority students from local high schools. Berkeley students, in turns out, are like most Americans: they want diversity without the zero-sum calculus that inevitably accompanies affirmative action.</p><p>Ending affirmative action on campus has had many fewer nightmarish effects in California than you might have thought from the initial returns. Many, though scarcely all, of the minority students who didn't get in to Berkeley or U.C.L.A. the first year after Prop. 209 was passed enrolled instead at one of the less selective U.C. campuses, including Irvine, Santa Cruz and Riverside -- a phenomenon known in the affirmative action world as ''cascading.'' What's more, thanks to some deft fiddling with admissions criteria, Berkeley found that the zero-sum calculus was not quite as inexorable as it seemed. In early April, the admissions office announced that Berkeley had admitted 30 percent more minority students than it had the year before. Apparently it takes a year to get the fiddling right, since Boalt Hall, Berkeley's law school, experienced a comparable jump in its second post-preference entering class as well.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Finally, ending affirmative action has had one unpublicized and profoundly desirable consequence: it has forced the university to try to expand the pool of eligible minority students. Outreach programs like the one underwritten by Proposition 3 have proliferated; the State Legislature authorized $38.5 million for such efforts last year and has required the public schools to spend an additional $31 million on similar initiatives. U.C. campuses are now reaching down into the high schools, the junior highs and even the elementary schools to help minority students achieve the kind of academic record that will make them eligible for admission, thus raising the possibility that diversity without preferences will someday prove to be more than a fond hope. Academics and administrators throughout the system admit that the university would never have shouldered this burden had it not been for the elimination of affirmative action; and many say that the price is worth paying. As Saul Geiser, head of student academic services for the U.C. system, says: ''California has brought this whole new thing to the country with Proposition 209. Maybe we can be the ones who begin to show what's on the other side.''</p><p>What's on the other side is not so much a coherent alternative to affirmative action as it is a series of impromptu adaptations. Elements of this unsystematic system may frustrate ideologues on both sides of the debate: liberals think that cascading represents a terrible denial of opportunity, and conservatives think that fiddling undermines the principle of merit. The question is whether the new dispensation is preferable to the old one. The answer is yes.</p><p>The University of California is, like gaul, divided into three parts. According to the 1960 master plan, the top eighth of graduates in the state are eligible to enroll in one of the U.C. campuses; the top third may attend one of the Cal State colleges, and the remainder can enroll in junior college and eventually transfer to a four-year institution (though few actually do). In recent years, however, as increasing numbers of high-school graduates have trained their sights on Berkeley and U.C.L.A., the U.C. system has developed a meritocratic ladder of its own. The campuses at the bottom, including Santa Cruz and Riverside, accept all U.C.-eligible students, but you have to be in the upper third of that group -- in the top 4 percent of the state -- to make it into Berkeley or U.C.L.A. Not many Latinos, and a minuscule number of blacks, make it into this pool-within-a-pool. And so the essential function of affirmative action in California has been to redistribute minority students from the bottom to the top of the U.C. ladder. Berkeley's gain, until recently, has been Riverside's loss. Now it's working the other way around. One way to think about the consequences of ending affirmative action, then, is to ask, How bad is it to go to Riverside?</p>                </div>
