    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Why is baseball such a sure-fire attraction, even outside the stadium? As museums and galleries in New Jersey embrace baseball as a subject for exhibitions this summer, the question of whether the sport is secretly an art form does come up.    ''Baseball isn't just sport or entertainment; it touches a lot of people's lives,'' said Steven Klindt, executive director of the Morris Museum and the curator of its current show ''We're Talkin' Baseball: New Jersey Minor League Baseball.'' Like the museum itself, baseball touches on humanities, history, art and culture, added Mr. Klindt, who worked as an umpire in summer jobs through high school and college.  ">

                    <p>Why is baseball such a sure-fire attraction, even outside the stadium? As museums and galleries in New Jersey embrace baseball as a subject for exhibitions this summer, the question of whether the sport is secretly an art form does come up.</p><p>''Baseball isn't just sport or entertainment; it touches a lot of people's lives,'' said Steven Klindt, executive director of the Morris Museum and the curator of its current show ''We're Talkin' Baseball: New Jersey Minor League Baseball.'' Like the museum itself, baseball touches on humanities, history, art and culture, added Mr. Klindt, who worked as an umpire in summer jobs through high school and college.</p><p>There's nothing new about baseball's being arty. Summer after summer, photorealist and Pop Art paintings with baseball themes appear in Manhattan galleries. And museums, eager to try new ideas for the old reason of luring visitors and their cash, have lifted the boundaries on what goes into their spaces. Baseball's universality has yet to fail curators as a major attraction, and even the minor and independent leagues are considered star material. As Dave Kaplan, the executive director of the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in Little Falls, said, ''There's a renaissance of minor-league baseball right now, and in particular in New Jersey.''</p><p>Take ''We're Talkin' Baseball,'' at the Morris Museum through Sept. 24. In a state that doesn't have its own major league team, the minor leagues are hogging the plate. For a 10-year-old who plays on an all-star Little League team himself, a trip to the museum brought an impromptu game of Wiffle Ball in the outdoor miniature ''Fleet Stadium,'' named for the show's sponsor, Fleet Bank. It comes with a diamond, a backstop, dugouts, a home-run fence and a fresh-water canteen.</p>                </div>

                    <p>For adult visitors, the nostalgic displays of memorabilia from early minor league teams are a sentimental journey to the time when their own grandparents probably attended games in hometowns like Jersey City and Newark. One display case contains paraphernalia that belonged to the Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, owned by Harry Bacharach (father of Burt), the mayor in the 1920's. The Bacharach Giants were also notable for being founding members of the American Negro League, and in 1926, they took the pennant and brought New Jersey its first World Series in the league. Soon after, the Depression killed off the team.</p><p>More relevant today is the display case of objects that tell the story of the Newark Bears, a team that has just been resurrected and was originally known as the Grizzlies. At one time, they were considered not only one of the best minor league teams in the country but also a lifeline of their city. Yogi Berra started as a Bear in 1946 before moving up to the New York Yankees that season.</p><p>Do your children know how bats are made? They don't begin as digital computer chips, although Bill Gates is probably researching that possibility. A display of bats borrowed from the Yogi Berra Museum reveals that they begin as cut logs and end as branded bats.</p><p>Baseball knowledge can go only so far. Children can burn energy at the exhibition's small indoor bullpen. On a weekday in July, boys were pitching soft-cushioned balls into a net. Baseball jerseys and catcher's gear may be tried on in the section of the show that features original, representative equipment from each of the state's six professional minor league teams. And many children had no hesitation donning headphones to pretend they were television broadcasters at a Trenton Thunder game, keeping in mind one of Phil Rizzuto's tips, noted on a wall: ''Don't talk with a cannoli in your mouth.''</p><p>Among special events related to the exhibition is Mascot Day on Saturday, when children can make small talk with mascots from New Jersey minor league teams from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. They can also play Wiffle Ball with members of the New Jersey Wiffle Ball Association at 1 P.M.</p><p>At the Berlex Laboratories corporate headquarters in Montville, Ron Mayer of East Hanover is showing 84 of his pencil drawings of baseball players. Mr. Mayer is a self-taught artist who said he had always been compelled by celebrity. In the corporate gallery are softly detailed renderings of the older gods, among them Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron and Lou Gehrig, and current hotshots like Derek Jeter and Mark McGwire. Mr. Mayer's favorite drawing, however, is the one of Don Mattingly. (''I always liked him.'')</p><p>With so many lustrous players, how does Mr. Mayer, who has also written four books, including ''The 1937 Newark Bears'' (Rutgers University Press, 1994), decide whom to draw? ''Good photos and the popularity of the ballplayer,'' he said. ''I haven't found the right picture for Sammy Sosa yet,'' he added, speaking of the Chicago Cub.</p><p>It takes Mr. Mayer about 10 to 12 hours to finish a portrait. The sizes vary from 11 by 14 inches to 16 by 20, with prices ranging from $60 to $200.</p><p>The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, on the campus of Montclair State University, opened in December, hardly the peak of baseball season. But word travels fast, and with the Jersey Jackals' stadium next door, the museum has plenty of visitors. The environment consists of several darkly lighted galleries, as if you are treading in hallowed territory. There's no trouble seeing anything, though, namely memorabilia and hundreds of blown-up photographs of the greatest players and teams, not to mention that very fine catcher himself, Lawrence Peter Berra.</p><p>Given the museum's name, you'd expect it to be all about Mr. Berra, who lives in Montclair, but the displays are well balanced. In abbreviated fashion, they cover baseball history, great catchers, how the Yankees adopted New York as a hometown, segregation, early New York stadiums, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, baseball during World War II, Mr. Berra, changes in baseball and major-league milestones.</p><p>A film series runs daily in Canon Theater, which looks like a stadium. Last weekend, a movie about Joe DiMaggio said, among other things, that at one point he was the highest-paid player in the game, at $100,000 a year. Starting tomorrow, a film on Mr. Berra's life will be screened. Among the artifacts on display are Mr. Berra's jewel-studded Yankee World Series rings; the 1978 and 1998 World Series trophies, on loan from the Museum of the City of New York and the Yankees; a photograph of a baseball game in a ''Yankee Stadium'' in Africa during World War II, and the mitt Mr. Berra  used in the perfect game pitched by Don Larsen in 1956.</p><p>With so much baseball fervor packed into a rather small space, you'd think saturation would set in immediately, but it doesn't. That's because Mr. Berra, whose accommodating face and droll remarks are emblazoned here and there, has a way of cajoling even the most worn-out museumgoer. As only he could sputter, ''I really didn't say everything I said!''</p><p>''We're Talkin' Baseball'' continues through Sept. 24 at the Morris Museum, 6 Normandy Heights Road, Morristown; (973) 538-0454. Hours: Sundays, 1 to 5 P.M.; Mondays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Thursdays to 8 P.M. ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' may be viewed through Sept. 8, by appointment, at Berlex Laboratories, 340 Changebridge Road, Montville; (973) 538-7667. The Yogi Berra Museum is at Montclair State University, 8 Quarry Road, Little Falls; (973) 655-2377. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; until 8 P.M. on Jersey Jackals' game nights.</p><p>Photos: Baseball fans can follow their bliss at the Morris Museum, above left, and the Yogi Berra Museum, above.
