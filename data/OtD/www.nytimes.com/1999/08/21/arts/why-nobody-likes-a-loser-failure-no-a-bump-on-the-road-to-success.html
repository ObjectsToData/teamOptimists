    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="There is a curious inversion afoot in Silicon Valley, where Internet entrepreneurs whose start-up companies fail are more marketable to venture capitalists than those who have never failed at all. It is not how business is supposed to work, but there it is: in that corner of the economy, failure has become an asset, a resume-builder.     Perhaps in an industry where people do not know what they are doing, any experience is better than none; perhaps the willingness to fail  is admired because it suggests the courage to try. Whatever the explanation, the turning of failure on its head is a reminder of Americans' incessantly ambivalent and constantly mutable relationship with the idea of not ''making it.''   ">

                    <p>There is a curious inversion afoot in Silicon Valley, where Internet entrepreneurs whose start-up companies fail are more marketable to venture capitalists than those who have never failed at all. It is not how business is supposed to work, but there it is: in that corner of the economy, failure has become an asset, a resume-builder.</p><p>Perhaps in an industry where people do not know what they are doing, any experience is better than none; perhaps the willingness to fail  is admired because it suggests the courage to try. Whatever the explanation, the turning of failure on its head is a reminder of Americans' incessantly ambivalent and constantly mutable relationship with the idea of not ''making it.''</p><p>Failure has been with us as the shadow of success since the republic's early days, when Benjamin Franklin lectured that ''little strokes fell great oaks'' -- that with enough diligence and tenacity, anyone could succeed. In the two centuries since, as capitalism has expanded its hold on American life, success has become that much more important and failure that much more catastrophic. Its definition, in fact, seems to have quietly broadened to encompass not just those who fail outright, but those who do not achieve extraordinary and public success.</p><p>As in Silicon Valley, of course, there are exceptions. In the age of instant memoirs and commercial endorsements, for example, Bob Dole, Dick Morris, and others have shown that failure can actually be profitable. Indeed, to judge from talk shows and tabloids, the only true failure nowadays sometimes seems to be obscurity.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But for most Americans the stigma of failing remains, and thus the quest to assign a moral cause for it continues. Whether the blame for those who fail to make it up the ladder lies with larger socioeconomic forces or with the individual is an unspoken subtext of the ideological battle between liberals and conservatives. It is the backdrop of countless policy debates, on subjects from welfare to how hard it should be to declare bankruptcy.</p><p>Yet while plenty of Americans have experience with failure, few like to dwell on it, at least outside their therapists' offices.</p><p>''Historians in particular and Americans in general don't like to talk about failure very much,'' said Scott Sandage, a professor at Carnegie Mellon who is at work on a book called ''Forgotten Men: Failure in American Culture,'' to be published by Harvard University Press.</p><p>There are, he says, dozens of studies of the ideology of success in America, but until recently, historians have not looked at the experience of failure. Professor Sandage is doing just that -- researching not great men who momentarily stumbled, but ordinary men who despite their honest toil slowly, or sometimes instantaneously, sank.</p><p>He has dug through family papers and diaries, credit reports and letters to understand how Americans grappled with failure in a society where hard work was supposed to equal success.</p><p>The answer was usually to find some flaw in the person's character. He cites the example of Robert Brown, a farmer and planter in antebellum Virginia who was described in various business records as ''one of nature's best sons'' -- a decent if slightly naive man -- while he was prospering. But when he went bankrupt some of the same people described him as ''a man of no energy'' -- a phrase that Professor Sandage says became common in the 1850's and 1860's to describe failures who were not idlers or drunkards.</p><p>''It is a profound threat to the fundamental ideology of America if it never comes together'' despite one's best efforts, Mr. Sandage said.</p><p>So when Fitch Raymond, a Cleveland grocer who failed during the Panic of 1873, requested assistance from a friend, he defended himself against the assumption that he was to blame: ''I have been Struggling incessantly trying to re[g]ain a little foothold but without success,'' he wrote. ''Not because I am imbecile, shiftless, lazy, listlessly, loafing about, no, not a bit of it, but the reverse is true.''</p><p>Over time Mr. Sandage said, failure has been transformed from an action -- failing at a business or other venture -- to an identity. Today, being known as a ''loser'' and the words ''I am a failure'' have become common coinage.</p><p>The rise of super-successes like Carnegie and Rockefeller at the end of the 19th century helped breed the phenomenon that might be called failure through inadequacy: unless one achieved and amassed on a grand public scale, one had failed. As capitalism exploded, Americans began grappling with how to process failure in a society that held that the individual made his fortunes or broke them. The notion of treating failure as a bump on the road to success -- still very much evident today in self-help books with titles like ''Failure: The Back Door to Success'' -- began to emerge.</p><p>In the 1920's, the decade when  President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed that ''the chief business of the American people is business,'' a little homily called ''The Failure'' circulated in popular magazines, Merrill Peterson writes in ''Lincoln in American Memory.'' It recounted the defeats Abraham Lincoln had suffered and concluded: ''How would you stand in the face of such setbacks? Think it over!''</p>                </div>
