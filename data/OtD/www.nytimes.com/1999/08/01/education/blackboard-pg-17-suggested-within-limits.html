First-year students must decide whether, how often and with whom they will have sex, as well as whether, how often and with whom they will do the laundry, clean the room, eat lunch, go to class and study.</p><p>Parents have had 17 years to influence the values and behavior of their children. No matter how successful they have been, they must understand that their influence will diminish, by a lot, when students enter the dormitory, a place with its own language and culture, terra incognita to anyone over 40. Even if they could have an impact, parents should step back to help their sons and daughters learn to make their own decisions and to accept responsibility for them. Send love and money, I concluded, but not advice about academic or interpersonal matters.</p><p>In 1999, institutions inundate you with information. In its orientation meetings and ''Parents and Family Handbook,'' Bates College provides a brief history of the college; a review of graduation requirements, the awarding of advanced placement credit and eligibility for the honors program; an introduction to health and career services, housing options and meal plans; policies on academic dishonesty, social misconduct, alcohol and drug abuse and sexual violence; and the addresses of local florists and bakeries for those who want to ''celebrate a job well done, to console a disappointment, or just because.'' With matriculation of a child comes membership in Bates's Parents &amp; Family Association and the opportunity to join Parents in Admissions, Creative Internships, the Welcome Committee and the Parents and Family Fund.</p>                </div>

                    <p>This information, however, is not intended to be an invitation to involvement but to suggest, much more subtly than I did a decade ago, that parents disengage. In disseminating rules and resources in all their plenitude, colleges and universities are announcing that they have the situation well in hand. ''Your role and influence,'' George Mason University asserts in its brochure ''For Parents Only,'' will be ''less obvious.'' Since ''letting go cannot be accomplished by hanging on,'' Mason advises, encourage your children to ''take on and manage increased responsibility.''</p><p>This approach doesn't always work. Parents still call the offices of deans and presidents, in high and low dudgeon, to ask why students were closed out of introductory Spanish or to protest the film about lesbian lovers shown during sexual-awareness week. Others try to choose courses for their children.</p><p>These unguided missiles, in all likelihood, cannot be reprogrammed. But most parents can become effective consultants to and advocates for their children, capitalizing on their unique understanding of and love for them. To that end, and tuition free, here are a few things parents ought to know:</p><p>* Many first-year students get homesick; some are sad and weepy. With few exceptions, the feeling will pass quickly, so resist the temptation to visit or encourage a weekend at home.</p><p>* Most students will establish satisfactory, if not always warm, relations with roommates, even if war breaks out in the first week. Residence hall staff always insist combatants work things out, sometimes long after it's obvious they can't. So if your daughter is sleeping in a lounge because her roommate is in bed every night with a boyfriend, demand a change, with her permission, of course.</p><p>* Parents invariably discourage their children from engaging in extracurricular activities during the first year. But students who do so tend to be happier and better disciplined, and have higher grade point averages than those who hit the books all the time.</p><p>* Most courses in the humanities and social sciences assign reading but no written assignments or exams in the first five or six weeks of the semester. So when freshmen say, ''I'm doing very well,'' they don't really know how they're doing.</p><p>* Some expressions should never be uttered, no matter how great the provocation. If your son announces he did not take chemistry because the lab was scheduled during ''The Jerry Springer Show,'' don't risk alienated affections or parenticide by asking, ''Do you know how much money I'm paying to send you to that school?'' Offer to buy him a VCR to tape the show.</p><p>* ''What can you do with an English major?'' is another misplaced question. A student's major has little bearing on admission to medical, law and business school, and not much more relevance to the job market. Students should major in what they like and are best at.</p><p>* Grades will not be sent home unless the student signs a release form. First-year grades tend to be the lowest undergraduates will receive. To place the performance in context, find out the average grades of freshmen in a particular area of study. A good rule of thumb in this era of grade inflation: C or lower in the humanities suggests the student is not doing the work; C or lower in the sciences means the student may be in the wrong field.</p><p>* Most parents know they should not hang on. But few students want mom and dad to let go entirely. When the school announces it is acting ''in loco parentis,'' insist on a role. It's your child, after all.</p><p>Photo: She's leaving home: Moving-in day at Sarah Lawrence College. (Linda Rosier for The New York Times)</p>                </div>
