The rallies, petitions and public protests of recent months have been striking if only to remind us how seldom the cultural elite have played a public role in a political debate in recent years. The contrast was driven home to me recently when I picked up ''Reporting Vietnam,'' the Library of America's collection of essays and reportage from 1959 to 1975. In addition to superb war dispatches, the anthology includes the work of such writers as Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy, who added to the antiwar drumbeat at home in public protests and in essays for Harper's Magazine and The Nation.    In hindsight, these volumes read like the winning side of an argument: it seems clearer than ever that the Vietnam War should not have been fought, since it could not have been won. But what of the opposing view? All but missing in the volumes is the odd assortment of writers who supported the White House at a time when most intellectuals were mounting the antiwar battlements. Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, James T. Farrell, John Steinbeck and John Dos Passos, among others, supported American intervention in Vietnam, some of them until the bitter end.  ">

                    <p>EARLIER this month, when a panel of novelists, critics and scholars resided over a kind of town meeting at Columbia University on the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, it turned out to be the last such event; a week later, the President was acquitted. The rallies, petitions and public protests of recent months have been striking if only to remind us how seldom the cultural elite have played a public role in a political debate in recent years. The contrast was driven home to me recently when I picked up ''Reporting Vietnam,'' the Library of America's collection of essays and reportage from 1959 to 1975. In addition to superb war dispatches, the anthology includes the work of such writers as Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy, who added to the antiwar drumbeat at home in public protests and in essays for Harper's Magazine and The Nation.</p><p>In hindsight, these volumes read like the winning side of an argument: it seems clearer than ever that the Vietnam War should not have been fought, since it could not have been won. But what of the opposing view? All but missing in the volumes is the odd assortment of writers who supported the White House at a time when most intellectuals were mounting the antiwar battlements. Vladimir Nabokov, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, James T. Farrell, John Steinbeck and John Dos Passos, among others, supported American intervention in Vietnam, some of them until the bitter end.</p><p>I encountered some of these names in the early 1990's while researching a book about Dean Acheson; they appeared in pamphlets connected to one of the nongovernmental '' 'citizens' committees'' set up to promote the Johnson Administration's Vietnam policy. Perhaps the most surprising was that of Ellison, whose 1952 novel, ''Invisible Man,'' had made him a figure of moral authority on the left. According to Charles Tyroler, a Democratic strategist who recruited prominent writers to sign pro-war manifestoes at Johnson's behest, Ellison agreed to help the Administration in 1967. ''He told me about his own merchant marine service and how disgraceful he thought it was for peaceniks and draft dodgers to denounce our boys in 'Nam,'' Tyroler said in an interview. ''And he thought it was disastrous for the civil rights movement to hitch its future on the antiwar diatribes of H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael.''</p><p>Ellison wasn't alone among African-American intellectuals. His closest literary friend, Albert Murray, told me: ''We were disillusioned with Martin Luther King Jr. for getting recruited to denounce the Vietnam War. Ellison was loyal to L.B.J., working with him to promote the humanities and to pass civil rights laws.'' Ellison was so enamored of President Johnson that he wrote an essay about him called ''The Myth of the Flawed White Southerner.'' With equal admiration Murray, in his novel ''South to a Very Old Place,'' portrayed L.B.J. as a messiah figure; Jack Valenti, Johnson's special assistant, later wrote to Murray that the President would read passages from the novel out loud just to savor the voice of an African-American intellectual who was on his side.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Far less surprising than Ellison's stance was that of John Dos Passos. Though he had once voted for the Communist ticket, in 1932, the 68-year-old novelist endorsed Barry Goldwater in 1964 and regularly lambasted the New Left for the ''stale dogmas of discredited Marxism.'' Still, even Dos Passos' close friends -- particularly Edmund Wilson -- were dismayed by his denunciations of Robert F. Kennedy's ethics and Robert Lowell's dovishness. ''Even to speak of pacifism in the United States today is the equivalent of a mea culpa,'' he declared in a 1967 interview.</p><p>Some of Dos Passos' pro-war sentiment can be ascribed to his unwillingness to distinguish America's motives in Vietnam from the grander goals of World War II. The same can be said of another writer of his generation, the author of the Studs Lonigan trilogy, James T. Farrell. Like Dos Passos, Farrell had been seduced by Marxism in his youth but had grown to despise Communist ideology. He was ''deeply disturbed that college students were siding with Hanoi instead of the White House,'' Tyroler recalled. As the debate intensified over Vietnam, Farrell considered it his duty to alert the public to the insidious nature of ''Peking-sponsored totalitarianism masquerading as Communism.''</p><p>Other literary figures also backed the United States' military involvement in Vietnam but waged more private battles. Vladimir Nabokov ''thought of Vietnam almost entirely in light of the crushing of freedom'' that Soviet influence might bring, according to his biographer, Brian Boyd. He even sent Johnson a telegram after his gallbladder operation, wishing him a ''speedy return to the admirable work you are accomplishing'' in containing Communist expansion and promoting civil rights. Among the younger generation, John Updike found himself ''out of step'' with his editorial colleagues at The New Yorker as well as with his literary friends on Martha's Vineyard, who were ''almost universally 'antiwar.' '' In the chapter ''On Not Being a Dove'' in his memoir ''Self-Consciousness,'' Updike recounts in painful detail his rationale for embracing L.B.J.'s military blunders. ''I do not believe that the Vietcong and Ho Chi Minh have a moral edge over us,'' he had written in 1966, ''nor do I believe that great powers can always avoid using their power. I am for our intervention if it does some good -- specifically, if it enables the people of South Vietnam to seek their own political future.''</p>                </div>
