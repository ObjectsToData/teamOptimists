                    <p>WE are as we as,'' Colman Rutkin said, meaning that he and Sage Reynolds were not about to rush around straightening up their rambling, 12-room house on Staten Island just because a photographer was coming.</p><p>Thank goodness. In the bleak midwinter, I was looking for people who didn't need spring to have green, living things keeping them company. And I didn't want them tidying up seedlings on the kitchen sink.</p><p>''We have plants in the bathroom,'' Mr. Rutkin said, ''plants in the attic, plants in the cellar.'' I went right over. His first words were, ''Sage, do you think she'll fit in the greenhouse?''</p><p>Mr. Rutkin is 5 feet 4 inches tall, so he doesn't have to hunch down like Mr. Reynolds, who is a half foot taller, to avoid banging his head against 20 hanging pots of cattleya orchids, while stepping over the 100 or so clivias that take up most of the floor of the 11-by-18-foot greenhouse the two men put up in their backyard five years ago.</p>                </div>

                    <p>By now, it's packed to the roof with their obsessions: the orchids, the clivias, echeverias, gasterias, euphorbias, an azalea or two. And dozens of lithops, which look like the soft pads of little animals turned upside down in the desert. Tiny little flowers open in between its two lobes, which vary in color from gray to rose to magenta, or a chartreuse that seems to glow from the inside.</p><p>''This is one of my favorites,'' Mr. Reynolds said, holding up a little pot with an olive-green pair of toes. ''Lithops otzeniana,'' he said, his mop of brown curls bobbing over the plant. ''It reminds me of a big mouth of teeth.''</p><p>These succulents from South Africa are also known as flowering stones, and Mr. Reynolds has started to hybridize them, cross-pollinating favorites with his finger or a Q-Tip.</p><p>''They were my first love,'' he said. ''When I was a kid, I'd look through cactus and succulent books, and I couldn't believe all the colors and textures.'' The lithops weren't widely available until about 10 years ago, but now you can buy them at Home Depot for $2 a piece. ''I went crazy when I found out I could actually grow them and produce crosses,'' he said.</p><p>Mr. Rutkin showed off the striated leaves of Clivia miniata, whose cream-white stripes (''like old piano keys,'' he said) shade to gray-green and then a dark green veering toward black.</p><p>''The Japanese think they're native to Japan, and the Chinese think they're native to China,'' Mr. Rutkin said, ''but they really come from the Natal province on the east coast of South Africa.'' C. miniata grows on rocks and trees along the coast, and it can survive dry periods by drawing moisture out of the air. Sometimes, a clivia with all green leaves will send up a striped one, which pleases the Japanese no end, he said.</p><p>''That's more noble, the sign of a real aristocrat,'' he went on. ''Like a lady in a very sober kimono, with something really flashy inside the sleeves.'' To get out the door, we had to squeeze by a camellia called Yamato Nishiki (Brocade of Old Tokyo), which was loaded with pink and white blossoms, and a rhododendron with long tubular white flowers that smelled of jasmine.</p><p>We pictured the yard in spring, when there's a sea of blue and white crocuses against the south fence. Mr. Reynolds stared down at the white leaves of a dianthus and described how it would look come May: ''It has two-inch flowers with pale pink fringed edges and dark maroon spots in the center,'' he said. ''It looks like saddle oxfords.'' He laughed irrepressibly, as he seems to whenever he thinks of flowers.</p><p>The two designers met at Florida State University close to 30 years ago, when Mr. Rutkin had abandoned a doctoral program in humanities for a master's in fine arts. Mr. Reynolds was an undergraduate, studying graphics and dance. He started growing sarracenia, or pitcher plants, in buckets on his patio.</p><p>Eventually, they came to Manhattan and formed the Four Hands Design Studio and Colman Sage, to produce and market their designs, which range from gift-wrapping paper and fabric to murals and folding screens. Mr. Reynolds also designs stained-glass lamps and torcheres, and his luminous paper tapestries line the walls of their sunny, 1920's neo-colonial house. Their studios are on the third floor: Mr. Reynolds paints in the east room; Mr. Rutkin in the west room, a table full of sansevieria keeping him company.</p><p>Where aren't there plants? (In the kitchen closet; it's full of fertilizer.) Abutilons fill the east windows in the kitchen, a pisonia lounges on the sink, its big leaves brushed with cream and green; a dish piled with the cuttings of a jade plant sits by the faucet. Mr. Rutkin's cymbidiums are stashed by the stove, by the closet, by the door. But only a few ceropegias survived the disaster that struck Mr. Reynolds's collection one night last winter.</p><p>''It went down to 23, and the heat didn't go on,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''Something like black death attacked the plants. They probably could have survived the cold, but the cold-and-wet was the problem.'' These rubbery vines, with hardly a leaf, hark from the Canary Islands, South Africa and Madagascar, but they don't look like much on Staten Island, until they cover themselves with their waxy, intricate flowers.</p><p>''I had about 40 different species,'' Mr. Reynolds said, ''but I lost half my collection that night.'' He preserved color photographs of their flowers, though, on a disk, and they sprang to life on the computer: Ceropegia arabica has little minarets; C. africana has twisted green cages; C. hybrida hort. has a black velvet top, like a bishop's miter, and C. distincta var. hayagarthii appears to be waving purple antennae in the air. They can be viewed on his Web site at www.users.interport.net/colsage/.</p><p>Up on the third floor, Mr. Rutkin has found the perfect place for coaxing his clivias into bloom: the trunk room. He has the windows cracked to keep the room chilly, which is what clivias need to send up the flower buds hidden inside the axils on their sturdy, long stalks.</p><p>But the young seedlings thrive in the warmer temperatures of the greenhouse and under lights in the cellar, along with Mr. Reynolds's various succulents and cuttings and stacks of pots and old storm windows (they make good windbreaks for the rhodies) and the wheelbarrow.</p><p>What they need, these collectors grumble, is another greenhouse. ''Something the size of our house,'' Mr. Reynolds had said earlier, hunched like Quasimodo over his lithops. ''We're thinking of putting one clear across the back, with a 20-foot ceiling.''</p><p>Downstairs, in the dining room, which has been given over to etching presses and plant tables under lights, Mr. Reynolds held up Ceropegia fusca, which looked like a bunch of gray sticks to me (organ pipes to Mr. Reynolds). ''This is one that nobody has gotten to bloom outside the Canary Islands,'' he said. ''Except maybe in the Netherlands.''</p><p>He fell in love with ceropegias just looking in books on succulents. ''I was just taken with the flowers,'' he said. ''They're really spectacular.'' Over the years, he has ordered the plants from catalogues, and traded seeds and cuttings with friends, so it was hard to lose half of them in one fell swoop.</p><p>''Right now, on the Internet, I've got some people in Holland who I hope will get me some more,'' he said. ''But I've been so beaten down. I lost so many last year.'' Mr. Rutkin calls this ''the voice of the plant-collector martyr.''</p><p>Order of the Lost Ceropegias? How do I join up?</p><p>Photo: OBSESSIONS -- Sage Reynolds and Colman Rutkin among the clivias and cattleyas in their Staten Island greenhouse.
