    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="A member of the International Olympic Committee from the United States said today that in an effort to improve Salt Lake City's chances of being awarded the 2002 Winter Games, his sporting goods company hired the son of an Olympic delegate from Swaziland six weeks before the decisive vote.    The committee member, James L. Easton, who is chairman of Easton Sports, said that on May 1, 1995 -- six weeks before the June 16 vote that awarded Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games -- officials with Salt Lake City's bid committee asked his company to hire Sibusiso (Sibo) Sibandze, the son of David Sibandze, a fellow I.O.C. member from Swaziland. Mr. Easton said the request came from David R. Johnson, the head of international relations for the bid committee.  ">

The committee member, James L. Easton, who is chairman of Easton Sports, said that on May 1, 1995 -- six weeks before the June 16 vote that awarded Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games -- officials with Salt Lake City's bid committee asked his company to hire Sibusiso (Sibo) Sibandze, the son of David Sibandze, a fellow I.O.C. member from Swaziland.

                    <p>A member of the International Olympic Committee from the United States said today that in an effort to improve Salt Lake City's chances of being awarded the 2002 Winter Games, his sporting goods company hired the son of an Olympic delegate from Swaziland six weeks before the decisive vote.</p><p>The committee member, James L. Easton, who is chairman of Easton Sports, said that on May 1, 1995 -- six weeks before the June 16 vote that awarded Salt Lake City the 2002 Winter Games -- officials with Salt Lake City's bid committee asked his company to hire Sibusiso (Sibo) Sibandze, the son of David Sibandze, a fellow I.O.C. member from Swaziland. Mr. Easton said the request came from David R. Johnson, the head of international relations for the bid committee.</p><p>Mr. Easton, who said he did not personally learn of the hire for about three months, did not in the end object to it, and did not consider it improper. Easton Sports, a $200 million a year company based in Van Nuys, Calif., manufactures high-end sporting equipment, including products used in Olympic sports such as softball and baseball, hockey, archery and cycling. Mr. Easton is also president of the international archery federation.</p><p>''My reputation is the most valuable thing I own,'' Mr. Easton said. ''I certainly didn't feel I was doing anything improper in cooperating with the bid committee in getting the Games here.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>When Mr. Easton's company was approached about the job, Sibo Sibandze was attending the University of Utah on a scholarship paid by the bid committee. Mr. Easton said that at that time he saw nothing wrong with that arrangement either.</p><p>David Sibandze resigned from the Olympic committee last month after an I.O.C. investigation concluded that the assistance given his son, including the college scholarship and other financial aid, violated guidelines concerning improper gifts.</p><p>Mr. Easton's admission is the first time an American member of the international committee has been directly linked to Salt Lake City's aggressive campaign to influence votes in securing the Olympics.</p><p>Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, the other American on the international committee, has said she made a telephone call to the University of Southern California recommending a spot on the tennis team for the daughter of a fellow delegate from Hungary. Mr. Easton's comments also appear to provide further evidence supporting the contention of some Salt Lake City Olympic officials that a significant part of the city's campaign to gain the Games was carried out more or less openly, and that many people were aware of at least some of the details.</p><p>Richard Pound, the Montreal lawyer and I.O.C. member who is investigating the Salt Lake City scandal, did not return a phone call seeking comment on whether Mr. Sibandze's hiring by Mr. Easton would be investigated. Twenty-four delegates -- a fifth of the committee's total -- have been implicated in Salt Lake City's vote-influencing campaign of providing cash, tuition aid, medical benefits, lavish gifts and other extravagant favors totaling as much as $3 million.</p><p>Sibo Sibandze was hired in the Salt Lake City office of Easton Sports, which manufactures arrow shafts and tent tubing. He was paid $9 an hour, and his duties included research, running errands and helping to install a new phone system. He earned from $8,000 to $10,000 between May 1995 and Aug. 30, 1996, Mr. Easton said, calling him ''an excellent employee.'' None of the money paid to Mr. Sibandze was reimbursed to Mr. Easton by the bid committee, Mr. Easton said.</p><p>In retrospect, Mr. Easton said, he would not have hired Mr. Sibandze, but, at the time, ''We and other companies in Salt Lake wanted to help the bid committee any way we could to be successful,'' he said. ''The bank hired people. The state did. The city did.''</p><p>Patricia Hanna, dean of the college of humanities at the University of Utah and a member of the Salt Lake City ethics panel that this week issued a damning 300-page report on misconduct by bid officials, said the report did not attempt to examine hiring practices, except in cases where the companies were reimbursed by the bid committee.</p><p>''We chose not to discuss hiring someone because that's an area of personal judgment that falls into a gray area,'' Ms. Hanna said. ''People worldwide have different opinions.''</p><p>Sibo Sibandze, it has been previously reported, also worked at City Hall during the bid process. He received two degrees from the University of Utah, and received tuition aid and other payments totaling $111,389.12 from the Salt Lake City bid committee between Oct. 23, 1991, and October 1996, according to the report issued Tuesday by an internal ethics panel. Neither Sibandze could be reached by telephone for comment.</p><p>Mr. Easton said he did not ask Mr. Sibandze who was paying his tuition but he assumed the financing came from the bid committee. In general, Mr. Easton said, he believed the scholarship program was a worthwhile humanitarian effort that allowed students from developing nations to gain an education and become productive citizens in their respective countries.</p><p>''If handled properly, that can be good for the Olympic movement,'' Mr. Easton said. Though the scholarship program was set up openly, Mr. Easton said, it later became a ''slush fund.'' The ethics panel report said that Mr. Johnson and Thomas K. Welch, president of the bid committee, never submitted Mr. Sibandze's or others' names for approval for scholarships and paid funds directly to some international committee relatives who never even attended school.</p><p>''As it was designed, it was proper; as it was used, it wasn't,'' Mr. Easton said. ''It became a catchall for anything they wanted to use for the solicitation of votes.''</p><p>Mr. Easton, who became a member of the I.O.C. in September 1994, also said yesterday that in the years leading to his appointment, his company had donated a pair of expensive mountain bikes to the Salt Lake City bid committee intended for Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the I.O.C., and for Mr. Samaranch's personal secretary. The bikes cost from $700 to $900, he said.</p><p>According to the ethics panel report, until 1994 there were no guidelines regarding a $150 limit on gifts received by international committee members.</p><p>Mr. Samaranch receives a large number of protocol gifts as president of the I.O.C., and said that he placed them in storage or in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. He has said that he is not subject to gift limits because he does not vote on cities seeking the Games.</p><p>An international committee spokesman said that Mr. Samaranch and his secretary, Annie Inchauspe, were traveling to Barcelona, Spain, and that they were unavailable for comment about the bikes.</p><p>Although he visited Salt Lake City when other international committee members were here during the bidding process, or spoke to the delegates by telephone, Mr. Easton said he was unaware of the dimensions of the inducements being provided.</p><p>''I was as shocked as anyone else to see the extent of what they were doing,'' Mr. Easton said.</p><p>Photo: James L.
