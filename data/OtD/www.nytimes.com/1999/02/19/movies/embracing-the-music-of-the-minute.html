    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Joel Sachs might reasonably have taken some vacation time at the end of January, and when his voice-mail message early this month said he would be out of town for a few days, that was the natural assumption. Mr. Sachs had just directed the annual weeklong Focus Festival at the Juilliard School, devoted this year to American music composed in the 1990's. Mr. Sachs, a pianist and conductor on the faculty who has  made crusading for new music his life's work,  selected the festival's 47 scores, by as many composers; conducted the first of the seven concerts; oversaw rehearsals for the others; wrote the extensive program notes, and moderated discussions.     But downtime seems not to figure into Mr. Sachs's schedule. His out-of-town trip was to participate in a residency at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., with Continuum, the new-music ensemble he directs with Cheryl Seltzer, the pianist who founded it in 1967.  Immediately upon his return from Williamsburg, Mr. Sachs repacked his bags and took Continuum to Paris to play works by New York composers in Radio France's ''Presences'' festival.  ">

Mr. Sachs had just directed the annual weeklong Focus Festival at the Juilliard School, devoted this year to American music composed in the 1990's. Mr. Sachs, a pianist and conductor on the faculty who has  made crusading for new music his life's work,  selected the festival's 47 scores, by as many composers; conducted the first of the seven concerts; oversaw rehearsals for the others; wrote the extensive program notes, and moderated discussions.     But downtime seems not to figure into Mr. Sachs's schedule. His out-of-town trip was to participate in a residency at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., with Continuum, the new-music ensemble he directs with Cheryl Seltzer, the pianist who founded it in 1967.  Immediately upon his return from Williamsburg, Mr. Sachs repacked his bags and took Continuum to Paris to play works by New York composers in Radio France's ''Presences'' festival.  "></div>

                    <p>It is also Mr. Sachs's personal method. At Juilliard, he conducts the New Juilliard Ensemble, a new-music orchestra, in five concerts a year, including one next Friday evening. And since 1993, he has been assembling and directing the nine weeks of thematic Summergarden programs at the Museum of Modern Art, which are also performed by enterprising Juilliard students. He said he had no idea how many works he prepares for performances in a year, to say nothing of how many scores he sorts through before making his selections. But caught for an interview after an evening rehearsal, he seemed energized by his schedule. ''I think we're living in a wonderful time, musically,'' he said. ''There are all kinds of really fine composers around, and anyone who wants to feel connected with the music of the time has all kinds of possibilities. Nobody can like everything, but there is something out there for everybody, from those who approach music very intellectually to those who say, 'I know what I like, and that's what I want to hear.' '' Luring an audience to the new-music fold has been central to Continuum's mission almost from the start. Mr. Sachs and Ms. Seltzer believe that new music can find friends among concertgoers if it is presented properly and played with energy and enthusiasm. But they recognize that many concertgoers remain hostile to new music, even though the last two generations of composers have been writing music that increasingly speaks to listeners who wish that 19th-century Romanticism had continued unchanged.</p><p>And they realize that many listeners trace their distaste for new works to compositional styles dominant during the first three-quarters of the 20th century, styles that Continuum stands behind, but that are only part of its portfolio.</p><p>The Devils and Scapegoats</p><p>The devil figure for antimodernists is Arnold Schoenberg, whose ''Moses und Aron'' is being offered at the Metropolitan Opera; a performance, with a national broadcast carried in New York on WQXR-FM  (96.3), will be presented tomorrow at 1:30 P.M.. The Met's production shows that when Schoenberg's music is brilliantly played and sung, its power to raise complex questions and evoke otherworldly images overshadows its supposed harshness.</p><p>But as the inventor of Serialism -- a system in which he hoped to skirt the limitations of tonality by treating all notes of the scale equally and by building themes from predetermined note sequences and their mutations -- Schoenberg is still reviled by his detractors for creating what they consider a species of needlessly complex, dissonant, inexpressive antimusic.</p><p>Some composers have agreed with that view. Reacting to the complexities of Serialism, early Minimalists like Philip Glass and Steve Reich stripped music to its essentials in the 1960's; they have spent the last 30 years rebuilding an essentially tonal language that still avoids the long arching melodies and the rich chromaticism of the late Romantics, elements that, some Minimalists have said, led inexorably to Serialism. Minimalism found a large and sympathetic audience among young listeners, who recognized elements of popular music in its motoric rhythms and often amplified textures. But many concertgoers who loathed Serialism disparaged Minimalism as simplistic, repetitive and droning.</p><p>Other currents, like the Neo-Classicism of middle-period Stravinsky and the Neo-Romanticism of Copland, Barber and Britten, fared better with the broader public and quickly joined the standard repertory. But they often struck new-music listeners as unduly retro.</p>                </div>
