Brad Smith, an 18-year-old freshman from a rural community near Utica, discovered in his first two months that he had easy access to his professors. ''You can always go and talk to them about anything,'' he said, adding that ''it doesn't have to be academic. I went to talk to my psychology professor the other day about a paper on behavior, and we talked about how I was doing at Hartwick. I learned a little about myself.''">

                    <strong>ONEONTA, N.Y.&mdash; </strong>
                    ASK students why they like Hartwick College, a small four-year liberal-arts school that happens to be in the Susquehanna Valley but in many ways reflects several hundred colleges of its kind in the nation, and the answers are generally a variation on the theme of ''small.'' Brad Smith, an 18-year-old freshman from a rural community near Utica, discovered in his first two months that he had easy access to his professors. ''You can always go and talk to them about anything,'' he said, adding that ''it doesn't have to be academic. I went to talk to my psychology professor the other day about a paper on behavior, and we talked about how I was doing at Hartwick. I learned a little about myself.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Aside from its congenial size (100 faculty members in 17 departments, serving 1,400 students), Hartwick makes a point of concentrating on the humanities. No matter what the subject, a general education - as is true of many small colleges like it - is encouraged over careerism. ''A student asked me why it is,'' said John K. Clemens, an associate professor of economics, as he relaxed in brown corduroys and down jacket on a snowy day here, ''that I.T.&amp; T. is selling off its recent acquisitions at garage-sale prices. So we talked about Alexander the Great, the greatest acquisition-and-merger specialist of all time. The guy knew how to get acquired countries to retain what they were acquired for in the first place.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Such is the attitude at Hartwick, where in fact students are discouraged from taking any management course in their freshman year. ''If a kid came and wanted to take two accounting courses and two marketing courses,'' said Mr. Clemens, ''we wouldn't let him do it.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Situated on a hill overlooking this once-booming railroad town 190 miles northwest of New York City, Hartwick started in 1797 as a Lutheran seminary, then became a chartered school in 1928. Forty years later the college severed its ties with the Lutheran Church and became nondenominational.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A certain newness permeates the campus. The red brick buildings, with white cupolas, gables and trim, give the impression of a more modern version of traditional New England schools. Most of the students, approximately half from New York State, live in coed or single-sex residences on campus or in the seven fraternity and sorority houses downtown.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The course requirements insure a broad range in certain basics. First, concerned about what it calls the ''problem of writing,'' the school tests all students on entering and then insists that they proceed through a series of ''levels'' until college-level writing competence is achieved. Then, besides fulfilling the requirements for a major, each student must take four courses in the humanities, three in the natural sciences and four in the social and behavioral sciences.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Classes at Hartwick tend to be discussions, not lectures. This is mainly, Mr. Clemens explained, because unlike large institutions with graduate schools and extensive research departments, teachers here ''are committed to teaching, not writing,'' another common characteristic of small colleges. As one indication of the emphasis the school places on teaching, student evaluations of teachers play a significant role in determining promotion and tenure.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A typical economics class consists of about 30 students. Mr. Clemens, a former marketing manager for the Pillsbury Company and a former San Francisco advertising executive, says he uses the technique of writing what the students have to say on blackboards in the class. ''I'm trying to get the blood pressure up,'' he said. ''I like to see hands up, people trying to get air time - then something is happening.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Prof. Robert E. Mansbach, the head of the philosophy and religion department, believes that the campus's setting within a community is a beneficial teaching tool. He takes advantage of it by encouraging students from one of his ethics courses to work several hours a week in Oneonta at a day-care center for poor migrant children. Hartwick students generally come from comfortable homes - tuition, room and board is currently $10,975 - and they see aspects of life at the center they have never experienced, Mr. Mansbach said. ''By just listening,'' he said, ''they found out a lot of things about violence and poverty they wouldn't have believed.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    During the month of January, when school is out, many sophomores, juniors and seniors at Hartwick go overseas; history and French students, for example, are off to Alsace this year. Others take part in programs of one sort or another in this country.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Douglas Falso, a 20-year-old junior from Cazenovia, south of Syracuse, is trying something especially practical this month. Under the guidance of Mr. Clemens, he and another student are knocking on the doors of Wall Street executives trying to raise $200,000 for a planned Humanities in Management Institute at the school. The money would be used to bring scholars to Hartwick to teach management through the classics, Mr. Falso said. THE students readily acknowledge that until recently, Hartwick's social life revolved around alcohol. They are now waiting to see the effects of New York State's new drinking law, which prohibits the purchase of alcohol by anyone under the age of 21.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Indeed, as a colorful remnant of its bustling days as a center for railroad traffic, Oneonta, with a population of 17,000, is known for its large number of downtown bars - which are frequented not only by Hartwick students but also by those from the neighboring campus of the State University College of New York at Oneonta. Early Sunday mornings students could often be found waiting for the post-midnight town bus that was specially routed to stop at the bars, pick up students and return them safely up the hill.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Perhaps because of its isolation atop the hill miles from a large city, Hartwick has plenty of social activities. On a recent evening, for example, the students held a ''monotony breaker,'' a party to relieve the boredom of studying for imminent exams, where sundaes and hot dogs were served by the school's food service and a band played at full throttle. The sororities and fraternities are popular - and are expected to be increasingly so with the state's recent raising of the drinking age to 21. About one-quarter of the students are members, and while the school administration has clamped down on hazing, the chanting of songs and general rowdiness can be heard from the fraternity houses late into the night in the fall term.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The stylistic differences between Hartwick students and their colleagues from the State University can be seen in a visit to the downtown bars. The Hartwick drinkers invariably adopt a preppy uniform - shirts, sweaters, neat jeans, loafers - in contrast with the university students' more punk look of earrings, tattered clothes and unruly hair. In the Hartwick student commons, the bookstore racks bulge with glossy fashion magazines, including Vogue, and according to one student, ''There are plenty of people here with the money to buy the clothes in those magazines.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    What is on the minds of Hartwick students? There are two camps. About half come to have a good time, frequent the bars, listen to music (stereo sound systems are quite a status symbol on campus) and study if they feel like it. The other half is concerned with graduate school. ''That's a big deal, to go to a graduate school with a name,'' said Miss Bronson. ''A lot of the people came here because they couldn't get somewhere else. And they're afraid that unless they get good grades they won't get into a good graduate school.''        </p>
