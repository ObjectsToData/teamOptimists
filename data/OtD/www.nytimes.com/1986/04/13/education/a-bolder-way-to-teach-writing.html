    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="  Last May I got a call from a dean at Gustavus Adolphus College, a small liberal-arts college in St. Peter, Minn., telling me about a new program that he thought would interest me. It did. It coincided with my own belief that the teaching of writing should no longer be left only to English teachers but should be made an organic part of every subject. The idea, which goes by the catch phrase of ''writing across the curriculum,'' is very much in the air these days among educators. But I had never heard of anyone actually trying it.   My caller said that in the fall term Gustavus Adolphus would launch a new curriculum in which more than 70 courses, covering the entire spectrum of a baccalaureate education, would be listed with a ''W,'' meaning that writing would be a required part of the course, that it would be a factor in the student's grade, and that the teachers would work with the students on the process of organizing, writing and rewriting their papers and reports. Three ''W'' courses would be a requirement for graduation.">

                    Last May I got a call from a dean at Gustavus Adolphus College, a small liberal-arts college in St. Peter, Minn., telling me about a new program that he thought would interest me. It did. It coincided with my own belief that the teaching of writing should no longer be left only to English teachers but should be made an organic part of every subject. The idea, which goes by the catch phrase of ''writing across the curriculum,'' is very much in the air these days among educators. But I had never heard of anyone actually trying it.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    My caller said that in the fall term Gustavus Adolphus would launch a new curriculum in which more than 70 courses, covering the entire spectrum of a baccalaureate education, would be listed with a ''W,'' meaning that writing would be a required part of the course, that it would be a factor in the student's grade, and that the teachers would work with the students on the process of organizing, writing and rewriting their papers and reports. Three ''W'' courses would be a requirement for graduation.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The dean asked if I would like to come out and talk with the students about writing. I said I would like to come out and talk with the professors; they were the real heroes of the mission. How had they been persuaded to undertake a task that is not only hard, but that would also be alien to most of them? How were they going to adapt writing to their disciplines? What were their fears and anxieties? This was a ready-made lab for me - unscientific, perhaps, but at least one where I could see some of my ideas at work. The fact that it was a college was incidental; the principle applies equally to elementary school and high school.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    My ideas fall, roughly, into three parts. One has to do with English teachers and what we expect of them. One has to do with motivation and its natural enemy, fear. And one has to do with the cognitive process: the fact that writing is also a way of learning.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    First, English teachers. Under the American system, they are the people who teach our children to write. If they don't do it, nobody will. They do it with dedication, but on the whole it's not where their heart is, or their training. Their real subject is literature. That's what they were primarily hired to teach, that's what they want to teach, and that's what they know how to teach. Very few of them en route to their Ph.D. got a course in how to teach writing.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Inevitably, much of the writing that they assign is based on literature - on what somebody else has already written - and therefore has no reality. And what the students in turn write for the English teacher is more florid than what they would write for anyone else. They reach for a ''literary'' style that is not their natural form of expression, assuming that literary writing means by definition good writing. Often it's not. It's often ornate and windy - far from the strong, clear style that students ought to be learning.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Next, motivation. Students will write more willingly if they write about subjects that interest them and that they have an aptitude for. They will also overcome the fear of writing that is planted in them at an early age - often, ironically, by English teachers, who make them feel stupid for not having been born with a gift for words. But writing is nothing more mysterious than the logical arrangement of thought. Anyone who thinks clearly should be able to write clearly. Countless Americans are paralyzed in their jobs by the inability to express themselves. This wouldn't happen if they understood from childhood that writing is a craft that applies to every area of life. It's not a special language that they have to be sent off to learn from the English teacher, as they are sent off to learn art from the art teacher and music from the music teacher. FINALLY, in the furor over why Johnny can't write, let's not forget to ask why Johnny also can't learn. The two are connected. Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts; it's how we think our way into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what we know - and what we don't know - about whatever we're studying. This is an aspect of ''writing across the curriculum'' that seldom gets talked about. But to me it's where the real excitement lies. It's an idea built on two premises: learning to write and writing to learn.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    I went out to Gustavus Adolphus and spent two days talking with professors in a variety of disciplines who had volunteered to teach ''W'' courses. They were all looking forward to it. To encounter this kind of enthusiasm at a college I had never heard of, in a sparsely settled corner of rural Minnesota, didn't surprise me. In my travels I've come to suspect that the teaching of writing is taken more seriously at little-known colleges and universities than at the big and famous ones. Again and again, at institutions that I didn't even know existed - Kentucky Wesleyan, Boise State, University of Southern Indiana, Meramec Community College, Davidson, Baldwin-Wallace and many others - I've met English teachers deeply committed to the task of getting students to write well. The news out there is good.        </p>
