                    Having earning a doctorate in education at Teachers College of Columbia University in 1979, Mrs. Shilkoff, who is 50 years old, went to work as the research director of the Academy for Gerontological Education and Development in the Bronx. She has since developed a buzzer system for aged residents of the community who were worried about crime, has helped the aged find jobs, and has written several resource manuals.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''Gerontology has given me a great number of options,'' she said.  ''I think that the opportunities are only going to get better for me because the number of aged people is constantly increasing.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In the opinion of most experts, Mrs. Shilkoff's choice was a wise one, in a time when an increase in the number of older Americans makes greater demands on facilities that they require. The population over 65 is growing about twice as fast as the population as a whole, creating new jobs in health care, finance and recreation and causing government and private industry to restructure existing jobs in fields ranging from advertising to teaching.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    One study, for example, predicts that by the end of the decade there will be a severe shortage of professionals specializing in geriatrics. Especially significant is that by then, according to the United States Census Bureau, there will be three million more people 75 and older than there are today.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''There will be a variety of new careers and an expansion of old ones because the elderly are the fastest growing segment of the population,'' says Herman Brotman, a consultant and author of ''Every Ninth American,'' a report on demographic trends prepared for the House Select Committee on Aging.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A study last year by the Rand Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif., predicted that by 1990 there would be a severe shortage of health professionals to treat the elderly unless the United States started training more people. Currently, only 600 of the 250,000 physicians in the United States consider themselves specialists in geriatric medicine. By 1990, the nation will need a minimum of 9,000 geriatric physicians, the Rand study said, adding that if the current rate of educating such physicians continued, only 800 out of 300,000 would specialize in geriatrics.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''The medical schools are trying to fill this gap, but they still have a long way to go,'' said Dr. Robert L. Kane, one of the authors of the report and a professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''About three-fourths of the nation's medical schools have something in their curriculum about the care of the elderly. In many cases, it is an elective or two or segment of another course. This is often inadequate to prepare physicians for the scope of problems that they will see among their elderly patients.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dr. Robert N. Butler, Brookdale professor of geriatrics and adult development at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, predicts that more residency programs will be established that provide up to three years of education for physicians who want to specialize in the care of the elderly. Mount Sinai recently became the first medical school with a department of geriatrics, and Dr.  Butler believes that perhaps 20 of the nation's 125 medical schools will follow that example.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Experienced physicians in other specialties - where training is in less demand because of age shifts in the population - also may be affected. Middle-aged pediatricians, for example, may go back to school for training in geriatrics and specialists in internal medicine, family practice and obstetrics and gynecology may assume a greater responsibility for the care of the aged.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dr. James Schultz, professor of economics at Brandeis University, foresees many jobs for those who want to work in fields designed to meet the needs of healthy old people. ''For example,'' he said, ''architects will be needed to design housing for the aged, and experts in recreation will be needed to meet their needs to remain active.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The number of people employed in these specialities is difficult to ascertain because they are commonly lumped together under general headings, such as ''architect.'' Interviews with educators, economists and officials of professional organizations indicate that the fields are growing and that people who have a technical skill such as social worker or urban planner and some special training or experience in working with the elderly will have a host of opportunities.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Yet, students are worried, experts say, that even if they do get the credentials they need to work in these professions, they will have little job security or will earn low salaries because of the possibility of further Government cutbacks in the Medicare program.  Because the elderly often have limited income, they cannot pay for the services of health professionals as readily as younger, employed persons do.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Some experts, such as Dr. Ruth Bennett, deputy director of the Columbia University Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, believe that graduates who have degrees in the humanities, arts and social sciences will have an easier time finding jobs if they have some training or experience in working with the elderly.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''There are going to be jobs in hospitals for philosophers who advise the staff on bio-ethical questions, jobs for journalists who can write about the concerns of the elderly, and opportunities for artists and historians who want to do work with the elderly,'' Dr.  Bennett said.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    People who want to work in these fields will have to be more creative in their job searches, said Anne S. Kahl, a labor economist with the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''Recent graduates might have to start out as interns or volunteers,'' said Miss Kahl, ''and then move on to paid employment because many of the programs that have hired gerontologists in the past are losing Government funding. In almost every field, an internship or a training program will give a person an edge in finding a job.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Private industry will also hire more people with skills in gerontology, Professor Schultz predicted. ''Only a handful of corporations now employ personnel officers who help employees with planning for retirement,'' he said, ''but more jobs will open up in this area as the vast number of people born during the post-World War II baby boom retire. There also will be lots of jobs for experts in finance who want to manage pension funds.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Jobs in advertising, education and other fields may also be restructured. Industry will have to attract more elderly consumers, and so jobs will open up in advertising for those who can tap this market. Teachers of adult-education courses will have an easier time finding jobs than will teachers at other levels.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    ''There are opportunities for people at all levels of education,'' said Dr. David A. Peterson, director of the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California. ''High school graduates who want to work as homemakers for the aged, as well as Ph.D.'s who want to do research, will find jobs.''        </p>
