WNET/Channel 13 is carrying, in addition to occasional one-shot specials, a slew of series featuring the works of independents: ''Non Fiction Television,'' ''Independent Focus,'' ''Matters of Life and Death,'' ''U.S. Chronicle'' and ''Video/ Film Review.'' Yet, an air of uneasiness permeates the overall picture. A recent public forum sponsored by the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers, Inc., opened with the observation that what is happening now could be either the beginning of a new era of production expansion or the swan song for the close relationship between independents and public television. Two major problems were perceived by most of the speakers: budget cutbacks within public television itself, and a general political climate that occasionally seems less tolerant of views outside the official boundaries of the Reagan Administration.">

                    The independent producer is getting unprecedented exposure on public television these days. WNET/Channel 13 is carrying, in addition to occasional one-shot specials, a slew of series featuring the works of independents: ''Non Fiction Television,'' ''Independent Focus,'' ''Matters of Life and Death,'' ''U.S. Chronicle'' and ''Video/ Film Review.'' Yet, an air of uneasiness permeates the overall picture. A recent public forum sponsored by the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers, Inc., opened with the observation that what is happening now could be either the beginning of a new era of production expansion or the swan song for the close relationship between independents and public television. Two major problems were perceived by most of the speakers: budget cutbacks within public television itself, and a general political climate that occasionally seems less tolerant of views outside the official boundaries of the Reagan Administration.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The ties that bind independents to public television have never been completely secure. A decade or so ago, stations were reluctant to spend much money on outside productions when they had their own in-house staffs to support. The independents, for their part, were so eager to have their work seen that they would often take a considerable loss on their production costs just to get on the air.  In that sense, the independents were - and frequently still are - subsidizing public television. But sometimes the gamble paid off.  Groups such as TVTV and individuals such as Jon Alpert and Alan and Susan Raymond gained national reputations and went on to work in the more lucrative fields of commercial television. A few years ago, Mr.  Alpert broke the network-news barrier against using outside correspondents when he began to supply NBC with special reports, many of them concerning political developments in Central and South America.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Over the years, as tighter budgets forced stations to reduce their own production staffs, the independents won a prominent presence on program schedules. In a great many instances, public television offered completion funds and technical expertise for projects already under way. WNET's TV Laboratory, headed by David Loxton, has worked closely with scores of independent producers. The fact is that public television now sorely needs the independents in order to flesh out an anemic domestic production schedule. But today, of course, the system is being buffeted on all fronts by cutbacks in funding. In addition to reductions in Federal support, there are likely to be fewer dollars coming from such traditional sources as the National Endowment for the Arts. The general economy is not helping matters. WNET managed to show a slight gain from a year earlier in the money collected during its most recent fund-raising campaign, but there was a decrease in the actual number of viewers contributing. Belt-tightening is the order of the day, and the independents, just about always with cup in hand, have good reason to start getting nervous.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    As far as the political climate is concerned, solid evidence of new Governmental pressures on the content of certain documentaries is hard to come by, but some observers insist that a pattern of interference, at times not so subtle, is clearly visible. The panel discussion arranged by A.I.V.F. happened to include two women independents whose productions stirred up some unexpected public controversies. Helena Solberg Ladd produced ''From the Ashes ...Nicaragua,'' a largely sympathetic but not uncritical account of the new Sandinist Government in that Central American country. Its point was that, as far as a majority of the population was concerned, the Sandinistas were preferable to the previous Somoza dictatorship.  The program received generally favorable reviews. Its stance, however, did not sit well with William J. Bennett, newly appointed by President Reagan to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Headlines across the country quoted Mr. Bennett saying that the program was ''propaganda'' and ''a piece of junk.'' For the first time since the openly hostile days of the Nixon Administration, there was talk within the public-television system of a ''chilling effect.''        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Also on the panel was Sharon Sopher, producer of ''Blood and Sand,'' a documentary about the on-going attempts by Morocco to annex adjoining territory in the Western Sahara. The move is being resisted by local tribespeople - apparently with more determination and success than had been anticipated by observers of international affairs. The program had been seen by Public Broadcasting Service executives in January, and, according to Miss Sopher, they were impressed and supportive. That would certainly seem to be the case inasmuch as PBS quickly scheduled the documentary for national broadcast in mid-April. Further, Miss Sopher was given PBS money to travel to Cuba and explore the possibility of doing a documentary there. It was, however, just before that trip in late March that PBS began raising all sorts of questions about the content of the Nicaragua program. Miss Sopher answered them and no changes were made. But PBS notified all member stations that the program could be controversial and that they could decide themselves whether or not to broadcast it. The program was shown in the New York area and in a couple of other major markets, but it has not been broadcast by the majority of public stations. In effect, the PBS decision seriously hampered exposure of Miss Sopher's work.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    What had happened? Representing PBS on the A.I.V.F. panel, Barry Chase, director of news and current affairs programming, said his version of the story differed from Miss Sopher's only in the details. He said that what he watched in January was a ''rough cut'' of the documentary, subject to further editing and tinkering. Miss Sopher insists that, except for some maps being prepared at a laboratory, the piece was a finished ''fine print,'' which she assumed was obvious to Mr. Chase. And so on. Asked to be specific about their objections, Mr. Chase and other PBS officials have singled out a segment in which a goat is slaughtered for food requirments, saying that the scene was too bloody for early-evening viewers. But far more gory scenes are shown almost nightly on the local news. Not mentioned by PBS, but far more plausible as far as possible controversy is concerned, was a shot of Alexander Haig, the then Secretary of State, testifying before a Congressional committee for increased military and financial support for Morocco. Miss Sopher caught Mr. Haig in a mistake when he said that Moroccan territory had been attacked by the resisting tribes. His office later admitted the error, but Mr. Haig refused a request to be interviewed for the documentary. Surely, this element of the film was far more ''sensitive'' than the butchered goat.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In the end, Mr. Chase insisted that his decision was not influenced in any way by outside pressures. It finally boiled down, he said, to ''a matter of judgment and experience.'' But this hardly assuaged the dubious video and film people at the standing-room-only conference.  There were complaints about one person wielding that much power.  There were questions about the extent to which ''subjective judgment'' should be allowed to determine the career of independents. There was more talk about the system shying away from sensitive subjects. John Lowenthal read a letter of rejection received that day from WNET in reference to his film ''The Trials of Alger Hiss.'' Although it has been reviewed quite favorably in theatrical release and although it was recently broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the film cannot get in the public-television door. The producer is convinced that Mr. Hiss still remains too much of a sore point in official Washington circles.        </p>
                        <p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Meanwhile, A.I.V.F. spokesmen declared that they would keep close tabs on what could be a troubled future. The assembled gathering didn't seem overly reassured.        </p>
