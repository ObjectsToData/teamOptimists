    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="If daily life in New York seems more, well, intense than elsewhere, it's not only because of the city's inimitable pizazz. It's also due to the multitude of artists on hand to record it. At least that's the impression you get from ''Eight Million Stories: 20th-Century New York Life in Prints and Photographs from the New York Public Library,'' a show whose cumbersome title belies its lively content.     Pegged to the city's centennial, this two-part exhibition celebrates a century of artists' efforts to convey New York's vitality in prints and photographs. It focuses on the lives of everyday people, and its stellar cast includes John Sloan, Lewis Hine, George Bellows, Weegee, Reginald Marsh, Walker Evans, Edward Hopper, Andre Kertesz, Martin Lewis, Helen Levitt, Jerome Myers, Garry Winogrand, Isobel Bishop, David Wojnarowicz, Dawoud Bey and Paul Cadmus, to name a few. In mounting it, the library demonstrates once again that its print and photograph collections rival those of major museums.  ">

It's also due to the multitude of artists on hand to record it.

Pegged to the city's centennial, this two-part exhibition celebrates a century of artists' efforts to convey New York's vitality in prints and photographs. It focuses on the lives of everyday people, and its stellar cast includes John Sloan, Lewis Hine, George Bellows, Weegee, Reginald Marsh, Walker Evans, Edward Hopper, Andre Kertesz, Martin Lewis, Helen Levitt, Jerome Myers, Garry Winogrand, Isobel Bishop, David Wojnarowicz, Dawoud Bey and Paul Cadmus, to name a few.

It's also due to the multitude of artists on hand to record it. At least that's the impression you get from ''Eight Million Stories: 20th-Century New York Life in Prints and Photographs from the New York Public Library,'' a show whose cumbersome title belies its lively content.</p><p>Pegged to the city's centennial, this two-part exhibition celebrates a century of artists' efforts to convey New York's vitality in prints and photographs. It focuses on the lives of everyday people, and its stellar cast includes John Sloan, Lewis Hine, George Bellows, Weegee, Reginald Marsh, Walker Evans, Edward Hopper, Andre Kertesz, Martin Lewis, Helen Levitt, Jerome Myers, Garry Winogrand, Isobel Bishop, David Wojnarowicz, Dawoud Bey and Paul Cadmus, to name a few. In mounting it, the library demonstrates once again that its print and photograph collections rival those of major museums.</p><p>The photography section of the show, assembled by Julia Van Haaften, curator of the photography collection, is more rounded than the print part. In printmaking, representational scenes of daily life began to wane at the end of the 1930's, when Abstract Expressionism wiped out the style of Social Realism then in vogue. Then the support of New Deal Government agencies like the Federal Art Project, whose workshops produced some 75,000 prints in New York City alone between 1935 and 1943, ended with the advent of World War II. So the prints in this show, many of them very familiar, go up only to the beginning of the 1940's.</p><p>The photographs, on the other hand, stretch from the turn of the century to now, beginning with Lewis Hine, the father of social documentary photography, and Alice Austen, the Staten Island amateur who at the century's turn did a remarkable series on New York street types. Although , modernism made photography more formal and arty in the 1920's, by the 1930's and 40's the ''candid'' camera revitalized interest in everyday people and events, as did the rise of photojournalistic magazines like Life.</p>                </div>

                    <p>By the 1930's, too, the Great Depression had changed the social climate to one more concerned with ordinary lives. From that era come such gems as Berenice Abbott's 1938 shot from the top deck of a bus of New Yorkers striding almost in march formation past a giant street clock at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street: John Albok's ''Coney Island'' (1932) showing couples necking gently on a blanket at that highly nonexclusive resort, and Walter Rosenblum's ''Tar Beach'' (1938), in which a group of teen-agers make the roof of a lower East Side tenement a remarkably wholesome rendezvous.</p><p>A preoccupation with the ''social value'' of photography began to assert itself in the late 1930's and early 40's, supported by the Federal Art Project's Creative Photography Section, another arm of the New Deal, and by photographers of the Photo League, a group dedicated to documentary photography for social change.</p><p>Memorable works of that period in the show include Bedrich Grunzweig's ''Home from Work'' (1940's), a stark cinematic image, shot from the Third Avenue El, of fast-stepping breadwinners and their shadows on a cobbled street; Weegee's famous ''Opening Night at the Opera'' (1943), showing two jeweled grande dames grimly observed by a lower-caste spectator, and Edward Schwartz's 1947 photo of a Lower East Side schoolgirl sweetly posing, books under arm, near a garbage can.</p><p>The 1950's and 60's, a period when more formalist concerns resurfaced, is represented by such photographs as Ann Treer's ''Madison Avenue -- in the 40's'' (1964), closing in on a tall, sleek office building that stands aloof from the crowd passing by its lighted windows, and David Vestal's ''West 22d Street, New York'' (1960), a glimpse of a flooded street gutter and an umbrella carrier viewed from above. But such ''esthetic'' photographs are rare here; the library has stressed the work of artists who deal more tellingly with people, like Beuford Smith's 1965 close-up of a midtown garment worker straining to push a rack of clothes.</p><p>Among the more recent works, new approaches and techniques produce some arresting results. They include J. S. Cartier's ''Flatiron Building at Night'' (1977), in which this icon's dark bulk is barely discernible from the surrounding darkness, with pinpoint illumination provided by a tiny light in a high window; Devon Cummings's five-panel work from her 1997 ''Subway'' series of shadowy, silhouetted train passengers who convey more than a hint of subway anomie; Dawoud Bey's ''Long Island City Pizza Parlor'' (1981), a grungy interior in which the legs of a pinball player provide the only visible life, and Camilo Jose Vergara's mural-size color study, ''From the South Bronx Series, Vyse Avenue and 178th Street'' (1980-1984), which in five panels records the razing of a nice old apartment building gone to seed and its replacement by a raw new row of cookie-cutter town houses.</p><p>As for the print section of the show, organized by Roberta Waddell, curator of the prints collection, it brings to view some very old chestnuts, which is not to say they're hard to look at. The prolific painter and printmaker John Sloan (1871-1951), a founding member of the Ashcan School, is represented by no less than 14 works dating from 1905 to 1941. True, Sloan was a devout New Yorker, and the master of a light-and-shadow print technique that took its cues from Rembrandt. His quintessential New York City print is ''Night Windows'' (1910), a low-rent view of tenement windows ablaze with the life behind them.</p><p>Among three works by George Bellows (1882-1925), the best-known is ''A Stag at Sharkey's'' (1917), a view of two boxers in a brutal ring encounter. Edward Hopper's essay on urban loneliness, ''Night Shadows'' (1921), is worthily supplemented by his less-known ''House Tops'' (also 1921), in which passengers on the old elevated railway regard the passing skyline. Reginald Marsh (1898-1954) and Paul Cadmus contribute complementary scenes of Coney Island beach revelers, from 1935. Among the witty works by Peggy Bacon (1895-1987), a 1925 view of a drawing session at the Whitney Studio Club (a precursor of the Whitney Museum of American Art) relentlessly satirizes herself and fellow artists.</p><p>Of work done during the more socially conscious 30's, standouts include Fritz Eichenberg's crisp wood engraving ''Meyer's Cafeteria'' (1935), a frenetic scene at the short-order counter of a luncheonette; Fred Becker's undated ''Jam Session,'' a wonderfully rendered wood engraving of revved-up men and instruments, and Louis Lozowick's dramatic lithograph ''Bridge Repairs (Repairing Brooklyn Bridge)'' (1938), in which construction workers look down on a skyscraperama gridded by bridge cables. It's a pity, though, that the work of a few more recent printmakers of realist persuasion couldn't be found.</p><p>Not to worry. This is a show that will tickle New Yorkers, and give those who aren't a few cues to the city's uniquely urban provinciality.</p><p>''Eight Million Stories: 20th-Century New York Life in Prints and Photographs From the New York Public Library'' remains at the Center for the Humanities of the New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, through Jan. 9.</p><p>Photo: ''Home From Work,'' a 1940's photograph by Bedrich Grunzweig.
