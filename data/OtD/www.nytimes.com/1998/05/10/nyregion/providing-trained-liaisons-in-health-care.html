                    <p>''WE HAVE all had personal experiences with doctors, hospitals, clinics and the like, and as more and more of us find ourselves in managed-care plans, it has become increasingly difficult to navigate the health care delivery minefield,'' said Joan Marks, director and founder of a graduate program in health advocacy at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers. ''We all could use a friend at court.''</p><p>The program, the only one of its kind in the country, was founded in 1980 by Ms. Marks, a psychiatric social worker.</p><p>''I realized the need for trained health advocates back in 1969 when I was working as a geriatric counselor,'' Ms. Marks said. ''Patients needed someone to act as a liaison between them and health care providers. In one scenario, 51 different specialists saw the same patient and neither she nor her family spoke English. Clearly, there were difficulties. What they needed was an ombudsman, but when our program began, the term 'health advocate' was barely understood.''</p><p>Sarah Lawrence College, a small  private institution with a focus on the humanities, provided the broad educational base needed for the expanding roles of the health advocate, Ms. Marks said. ''The college recognized the growing need for professionals to represent the consumer in health care issues,'' she said. ''And today, consumers need professionals more than ever to help them get through the health care maze that changes in managed health care have brought about. Consumers are beginning to have serious questions about the intentions and integrity of everyone involved in health care.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The Health Advocacy Program, she said, offers an unusual approach to the study of health care. ''Unlike other advanced-degree programs, the focus is on health care from the perspective of the patient-consumer,'' Ms. Marks said. ''Graduates of the program work in diverse positions such as patient representatives and administrators, on ethics committees and medical policy boards at hospitals and health agencies. Health advocacy draws on concepts from medicine, law, economics, social work and health care administration.''</p><p>At a recent open house, potential students from a variety of backgrounds were represented. What they had in common, Ms. Marks said, was a desire to enter a profession ''where they could make a difference.''</p><p>She added: ''The first health advocates were nurses and social workers because they knew the system. But now students come from many occupations across the board in such fields as economics, law or photography. ''</p><p>The need for professional advocates is being fueled by national and state debates over managed care and consumer rights. In New York, a bill calling for a state ombudsman program, which would include a network of community-based agencies to provide direct help to all health care consumers, is under consideration.</p><p>''The opportunities for careers in health advocacy are growing accordingly,'' Ms. Marks said.</p><p>''Our graduates can expect to find a wide variety of jobs. Some will become patient representatives, hospital administrators, health educators and consultants to community groups. Others will staff health agencies, serve on ethics committees and medical policy boards, while others may find work sorting out inequities in the insurance industry.''</p><p>Salaries range from $45,000 to $100,000 for someone heading a department dealing with major moral and physical issues, Ms. Marks said.</p><p>''The bottom line is that advocates play a vital role in health care today,'' she said. ''They give objective advice from the smallest question posed by patients to the largest. They are in contact with the family. They can be found at a patient's bedside explaining a medical procedure or before a senator's desk, discussing legislation. And they have the ability to interact with doctors, administrators and community agencies alike.''</p><p>As students they are exemplary, said Dr. Marsha Hurst, who teaches two of the program's courses. ''They are mature, highly motivated adults who have made an unusual choice to go into the field of health care advocacy in its early stages,'' she said.  ''And many have made sacrifices in order to be in the program. This is a professional discipline that attracts people who are not only smart and looking for new career opportunities but also those who are interested in helping others and making a difference. They are wonderful to teach.''</p><p>The importance of a master's degree as a health advocate, Dr. Hurst said, is demonstrated by the success of the program's graduates. There are patient representatives' programs at major teaching hospitals, including the Hospital for Special Surgery, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Westchester Medical Center. The programs have employed Sarah Lawrence graduates, who also serve in advocacy roles in groups like the San Francisco Health Plan and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p><p>''From the very beginning, when consumerism was just beginning to be an issue, major hospitals were impressed with the advocacy concept,'' Ms. Marks said. ''A compelling reason is economic. Having an impartial patient advocate on the staff enables a hospital to operate more effectively, which translates into cost saving.''</p>                </div>
