By the middle of June, five of his plays will have been done at the Brooklyn Academy of Music alone, including the rarely seen ''Cymbeline,'' opening on Wednesday at the Opera House in a version by the Royal Shakespeare Company, now in residence at BAM.</p><p>In February, Theater for a New Audience staged ''Richard II'' and ''Richard III''; in March, the Joseph Papp Public Theater presented ''Macbeth'' and the Cheek by Jowl troupe ''Much Ado About Nothing'' at BAM; in April, the Royal National Theater's version of ''Othello'' arrived at BAM, where yesterday the R.S.C.'s ''Hamlet'' ended its run; the company's final performance of another rarely performed play, ''Henry VIII,'' is today; in June, previews begin of ''Twelfth Night'' at Lincoln Center Theater, and in August, another production of ''Cymbeline'' takes up residence at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.</p><p>With the directors of the two ''Cymbelines'' in town -- Adrian Noble, the artistic chief of the R.S.C., and Andrei Serban, the head of the graduate acting program at Columbia University, School of the Arts -- it seemed only fair to inquire about this unwieldy epic, its five acts so stuffed with adventures that many directors go out of their way to avoid it.</p><p>Lost children, cross-dressing, mistaken identities, an evil stepmother, banishment, pitched battles, the dead returning to life, the god Jupiter arriving onstage -- these are only some of the play's ingredients. Paradoxically, as Mr. Noble and Mr. Serban agreed, ''Cymbeline,'' for all its outward tumult, really has to do with the inner workings of human beings: specifically, change and forgiveness.</p>                </div>

                    <p>On the surface, the story is about the title character, Cymbeline, king of pre-Christian Britain, who has married a second time. His new wife plots to have her cloddish son, Cloten, marry the king's daughter, Imogen. When Imogen defies her parents and marries the honorable Posthumus, he is banished. In exile in Italy, he boasts of Imogen's perfection to the villainous Iachimo, who bets that he can seduce her. The confident husband accepts the challenge. But Iachimo tricks him by hiding in a trunk in Imogen's bedroom and emerging when she is asleep to look but not touch, as well as to steal her jewelry, proof that he has won his bet. The furious Posthumus decides that Imogen must die.</p><p>When she learns of this, Imogen disguises herself in male clothing and disappears into the wild, where she meets two young men, who, it turns out, are her missing brothers. It is not giving anything away to say that after five acts, happiness triumphs. But what of the directors of ''Cymbeline''? Do they?</p><p>Mr. Noble and Mr. Serban talked about the pleasures and pains of the play one recent morning at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. Mr. Noble was about to open the R.S.C. visit to the academy with ''Hamlet,'' while Mr. Serban was in final rehearsals with his drama students of Brecht's ''Caucasian Chalk Circle'' at La Mama, where it ends its run tonight.</p><p>Here are excerpts from their conversation.   ANDREA STEVENS</p><p>ADRIAN NOBLE.  People don't realize how long ''Cymbeline'' is. Without cuts it's four hours.</p><p>ANDREI SERBAN.  No.</p><p>NOBLE.  Four hours, I promise you. Ours is heavily cut. I've taken 1,000 lines out of it.</p><p>SERBAN.  You've done it before?</p><p>NOBLE.  This is my only outing with it.</p><p>SERBAN.  I've never seen it or directed it and I'm just starting.</p><p>NOBLE.  It's absolutely massive. ''Hamlet'' is the longest; I think ''Cymbeline'' is as long as ''Richard III.'' But I didn't cut it just because it was long. Some of the writing is desperately hard to follow. And as I'm not a Shakespeare purist, I think it's worth trying to preserve what he was attempting to do. Sometimes you can achieve that by cutting.</p><p>SERBAN.  It's in Japanese style, no?</p><p>NOBLE.  We never intended that. We used a ramp out into the audience at the Royal Shakespeare Theater in Stratford because we thought it might be of use in telling the story of ''Cymbeline.'' And people said, ''Oh, that's sort of -- Japanese.'' Then we went a little further toward the Japanese with the costumes.</p><p>It seemed to me that after the very dark plays of ''Othello,'' ''Hamlet,'' ''Coriolanus'' -- in 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608 -- Shakespeare changed. As an artist, he renewed himself. The way he did it was to turn to myth and romance, what we would now call fairy tales. If you look at that last grouping of plays -- ''Cymbeline,''  ''Pericles,''  ''The Winter's Tale'' and ''The Tempest'' -- in all of them he sought an exoticism: a desert island, all around the Mediterranean, Bohemia, a sea journey.</p><p>So we were seeking a location for ''Cymbeline'' that had an exoticism. For us in England, setting it in ancient Britain is about as exotic as a car crash. You put actors in sackcloth and people think, ''Oh, get out! That's not exotic. Go home.'' So we turned East.</p><p>SERBAN.  I haven't decided on any concept yet, but it seems to me that this is one play that doesn't easily work with modern costumes. What interests me in ''Cymbeline'' is the inner spiritual journey; it's about the temptation of the soul. At the beginning is this meeting between Imogen and Posthumus -- the quick wedding, which is like a too perfect ''Romeo and Juliet.'' What Shakespeare seems to be telling us is that marriage is a gift that has to be deserved. In order to be cherished, it first has to disappear. So Posthumus is banished from the court. And suddenly, his pride and vanity take over. In exile, he boasts about how great Imogen is. But when Iachimo lies to him about her, he immediately turns against her. So we see how much his vanity is at stake.</p>                </div>
