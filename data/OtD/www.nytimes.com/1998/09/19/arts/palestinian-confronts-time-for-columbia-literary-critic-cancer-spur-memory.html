Said began writing a memoir mostly about his childhood in Palestine in the years before Israeli independence in 1948, before his family fled to Egypt, before he landed at Columbia University, before he became one of the most influential literary and cultural critics in the world.</p><p>Several months ago, something struck Mr. Said about his timing: The writing of the memoir, which he is currently finishing, had coincided exactly with his treatment for leukemia, which was diagnosed after a routine cholesterol test in 1991 and which is likely one day to end his life.</p><p>The start of chemotherapy in 1994 had been a point of no return, an acknowledgment that Mr. Said was entering what he calls a final phase. The start of the memoir was the opposite, a going back, an effort to rescue from oblivion a time and places that had all but disappeared.</p><p>So they fell into a rhythm, the writing and the illness, each in counterpoint to the other. For the first six months of last year, Mr. Said was too sick to teach. He had various viruses, then pneumonia. The leukemia worsened. Unable to work, he wrote.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''It's like the inverse of my illness,'' he said in an interview recently. ''It's like a mirror, but from which all the actual images have been effaced. There is nothing in the book about it. And I found that very salutary, having something like that to go back to.''</p><p>Mr. Said, 62, is a man of many dimensions. He is one of the most important literary critics alive, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia, the author of 15 books, a music critic, a scholar of opera, a pianist, a father of two grown children and arguably the most eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause in the West.</p><p>He has been a major force in recreating the field of literary studies over the past two decades. His work helped give form to entire new scholarly areas, like post-colonial theory. His 1978 book, ''Orientalism,'' revolutionized the study of the Middle East and has been argued over bitterly for years.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Said has done as much as anyone to raise the profile of the Palestinian cause in American intellectual life. He writes frequently on the subject. He was a member of the Palestinian National Council until 1991 and recently made a film about the Palestinians for the BBC.</p><p>He is a relentless critic of Israeli policy on the Palestinians; of United States foreign policy in the Middle East, and, in the last few years, of Yasir Arafat and of the Oslo accords, calling the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization ''an instrument of Palestinian surrender.''</p><p>In the eyes of admirers, Mr. Said is brilliant, charismatic, passionate, funny, erudite, engaged. For some, he is also a personal model, managing to combine a rigorous intellectual life and impassioned political engagement.</p><p>To those who dislike him, he is polemical, extremist, conspiratorial, irresponsible, anti-American. They say he attributes political motives to everyone but himself. Detractors have called him a Nazi, a ''professor of terror,'' Arafat's apologist. In 1985 his office was set on fire.</p><p>''He has a very unconventional brain,'' said Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli pianist and conductor, who has known Mr. Said since 1992 and considers him one of his closest friends. ''I think he has great intellectual courage.''</p><p>One afternoon this summer, Mr. Said was in his office at Columbia for the first time in weeks. He had been spending his days commuting to Long Island to be hooked up to an intravenous tube as part of a clinical trial of an experimental treatment for patients like him for whom chemotherapy failed.</p><p>Three afternoons a week, he found himself ''a Palestinian patient in a Jewish hospital being taken care of by an Indian doctor and Irish nurses,'' as he put it, pumped full of antidotes to the therapy's side-effects like soaring fever and uncontrollable shaking while fighting the urge to nod off.</p><p>On a day off from treatment, his face looked drawn. Beneath the broad shoulders of a dark blue sport coat, his frame seemed to disappear. His arms had grown so thin he could barely hold a tennis racket. In the BBC film, which he wrote and narrated, pneumonia had weakened his voice.</p><p>Yet Mr. Said rises at 5 A.M. to work in the Riverside Drive apartment where he lives with his wife, Mariam Cortas Said. He travels frequently and has multiple books scheduled for publication next year: a collection of lectures on opera; his political columns, published twice monthly in the Arabic newspaper Al Hayat, and his memoir, titled, with some resonance, ''Not Quite Right.''</p><p>''I've decided that it's possible to live with a sword of Damocles hanging over you,'' he said, when asked how long he might live (he prefers not to know). ''You can, by an act of will, not think about it. That was, I think, the major victory that I won. I don't think about death.''</p><p>Mr. Said was born in Jerusalem and spent the first 12 years of his life there, the eldest child and only son of a successful Palestinian Christian businessman. The family moved to Cairo in late 1947, five months before war broke out between Palestinian Arabs and Jews over plans to partition Palestine.</p>                </div>
