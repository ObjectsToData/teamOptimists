    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="ONE way to sum up Austin is to paraphrase an old Texas saying: Defining the town is like herding cats. As the capital of Texas and home to one of the largest universities in the country, Austin is an ideological melting pot: a literary haven and a slackers' den, a music mecca and a film-industry outpost. Dreadlocks and multicolored coifs are as common as pompadours, shags, Hillary bobs, flattops and, in the folksy diners and suburban malls, the Big Blond Do.    Austin has claims to Lyndon B. Johnson and Janis Joplin, Gov. George W. Bush and the columnist Molly Ivins. It nurtures musical generations ranging from Shawn Colvin and Abra Moore to Willie Nelson and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The Butthole Surfers  reside here; so do the world's first permanent photograph, a copy of the Gutenberg Bible and a colony of Mexican bats.     A person is as likely to pass Jimmie Vaughan walking down South Congress or Richard Linklater in the grocery store as to see Jim Wright on a sidewalk near the Legislature or Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman on break from a film shoot, checking out Beckett at the bookstore. Like Portland, Ore., and San Francisco, Austin is a city that feels like a town.    Topographically, Austin presents a similar paradox. I learned this recently from the caretaker of the O. Henry Museum on Fifth Street. Referring to a map made in 1887, the docent outlined the geographic traits that make this the city where the South ends and the West begins. On the west side of Austin, the rugged Balcones Escarpment rises up to mark the beginnings of ranch country, where scrub cedar, cattle and limestone crags freckle the landscape. Just east of town, the Blackland Prairie rolls to a lazy halt, and with it the cotton and soybean fields of the Deep South.     The old map gave me a sense of history and place. But as a relative newcomer to Austin, I had yet to find a cultural blueprint that encompassed the Sixth Street club scene, the grass-roots east side and the annual influx of tourists in March for the South by Southwest music and film festival. I decided that the best solution was to do what Texans do: get in a car and drive.    First, I parked myself in the perennially popular Austin Java Company, off Lamar Boulevard at the western edge of downtown, and over the French Roast-Sumatra blend, planned my attack. I would start with lunch at Cisco's, a patriarch of Tex-Mex dining on the east side, where autographed photos of Kevin Costner and other celebrities dress the dark-paneled walls. Sated with an enchilada plate, I would set out with my friend Joyce in her big-finned 1960 Plymouth Fury. The music would come later.    With highs in the 70's -- just as typical of Austin in midwinter as is an ice storm -- the day called us outdoors. We wandered to Red Bud Isle, a tiny oasis in the middle of Town Lake (created by dams in the Colorado River), where live oaks and cedar and pecan trees shade the sandy, rutted drive. We watched a man fish idly, and gazed at the green outcroppings on the bluff.     From there, we steered north on Exposition Boulevard toward the lush grounds of the Austin Museum of Art at Laguna Gloria on West 35th Street, a hacienda-style space that featured a William Wegman exhibit. We grabbed a spot behind the museum's art school and dangled our feet from a limestone ledge into Lake Austin. Mallards paddled past, a crane glided overhead, a woman paddled her kayak soundlessly.     Austin is physically defined by water. Fed by the Colorado, a strand of lakes and dams nestles against the western edge of the city, flowing down the escarpment from Lake Travis (about 25 minutes west of Austin and favored by scuba-divers), past Mount Bonnell, through Lake Austin and into Town Lake, which bisects the city. Sprinkled throughout town are Big Stacy Pool, a hot-springs-fed swimming pool; the trout-cold depths of Barton Springs and Deep Eddy pool, fronted by Deep Eddy Cabaret, which serves some of the coldest, cheapest beer in town. By boat, visitors could almost see a fourth of the city.    But my friend and I were navigating the greenways in the big white Plymouth, and we headed northwest from the museum to Ski Shores, a 43-year-old hole-in-the-wall a few miles farther up on the lake. Sitting on white plastic lawn chairs in front of the dock, we sipped beer and chatted with the proprietor, George Levy, who said that like many gems of Austin, his establishment battles dueling desires to draw new customers and maintain a laid-back atmosphere.    As the sun began to set, we headed back toward town. Driving an old car is the perfect way to negotiate Austin, not only because Texans love big automobiles, but also because the city nurses a longstanding love affair with vintage cars. You see them wedged between Mercedes Benzes, Land Cruisers and Buicks with ''Save Our Springs'' and ''Bicycles Not Bombs'' bumper stickers.    Likewise, Austinites cherish vintage clothing, furniture, Western wear, eyeglasses, you name it -- evidenced by the bustling funk of South Congress, where a strip of contra-chic second-hand stores and antiques shops represents Austin cool: places like New Bohemia, Electric Ladyland, Terra Toys, Yard Dog (a folk art gallery) are interspersed with restaurants that double as music venues, like El Sol y La Luna, Guero's and Shaggy's. Anchoring the night scene is the ever-retro Continental Club, a spacious hangout where the fashion is slick hair and Lucky Strikes.     The South Congress shopping area is a fine place to while away the early afternoon, after, say, a morning tour of the capitol. An 1888 faded red granite copy of the nation's Capitol, it is the tallest state capitol in the country and despite the development of high-rise hotels and the burgeoning of sleek shopping centers, its presence dominates downtown.     Other historic sites in the central district include St. Mary's Cathedral on East 10th, a limestone Gothic church built in 1874; the Littlefield Building, a neo-classical revival structure on the corner of Congress and Sixth Street; the dusty-hued Driskill Hotel, a Richardsonian-Romanesque affair circa 1886, where L.B.J. and other pols have kept suites and South by Southwest festivalgoers set up camp; and the General Land Office Building, a 140-year-old structure that is the capitol's visitor center, at 11th and Brazos Streets.    Another important part of Austin's history is the University of Texas. Since parking is problematic, it's best to take a cab there, where creeks and live oaks are punctuated by the white neo-classical tower that is one of 19 buildings on campus designed by Paul Cret, best known for the Detroit Institute of Arts.    But go to the university mainly for the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery, whose fine collection has been enhanced by the 20th-century American art collection of the late James Michener and his wife, Mari. Or go for the colossal Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, which houses plenty of L.B.J. memorabilia but also American political mementoes from Washington to Clinton.    And go for the Harry H. Ransom Humanities Research Center, which contains a rare complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and the first permanent photographic image -- a view from the artist Joseph Nicephore Niepce's window in Burgundy -- which Niepce produced on a pewter plate in 1826. Also, in the first-floor gallery of the research center is an intriguing collection of writer and celebrity paraphernalia -- Edgar Allan Poe's mother-of-pearl coin purse,  Gloria Swanson's sunglasses, John Philip Sousa's baton.     The Ransom center also houses some of the most comprehensive photographic, literary, film and design archives in the world -- but they are available only for research, which means that you must be a scholar in one of these fields. I am not a scholar, so I contented myself with the Huntington and Swanson's sunglasses -- although I did yearn for a look at the Hemingway and Faulkner manuscripts.     The next stop was the O. Henry Museum, the quaint, Victorian cottage of the short-story writer William Sydney Porter, a North Carolinian who came to Austin and met his wife, Ethel, and worked in a bank. The house contained furniture from the Porters' days there, and the tour guide explained how Porter became the writer O. Henry after being imprisoned for embezzlement.    I then stopped at my favorite watering hole, the Dog and Duck Pub on West 17th Street, for a Bass ale and a jalapeno-bacon Willie burger. Later, I meandered northeast for the kitschy environs of the Carousel Lounge, where oldtimers do the lindy to a one-man-band.     I then shot back south to another surreal slice of Austin: Ego's, the darkest, cheesiest, Tom Jonesiest lounge in town. Hidden in an apartment complex off South Congress, Ego's is the roost of the pianist Bobby Doyle on Thursday and Friday, and its red walls and rickety bucket seats will send you into a time warp.    On other nights, I prowled Club de Ville, the hipster hangout with an out-back cocktail garden nestled into a limestone grotto; the Ritz Lounge for tango; Highlife Cafe for an art opening; Waterloo Brewery for pool; the Cedar Door for a Mexican martini. In between, I hit galleries like Women &amp; Their Work, which had a fine installation of sculptures made of crepe myrtle by the Dallas artist Sherry Owens, and Flatbed Press, a print studio and gallery showing  wood block prints by Ann Conner.    I also visited the intimate portrait gallery and grounds of the Elisabet Ney Museum in the Hyde Park district, north of the university. This was the studio of Ney, the German sculptor patronized by Garibaldi and King Ludwig II of Bavaria, after relocating to Austin in the 1890's. She created the likenesses of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin at the entrance to the capitol's rotunda.    I made time to eat at Sam's Bar-B-Cue on East 12th (a seminal late-night musicians' haunt, canonized by Stevie Ray and company), grab coffee and imported smokes at Ruta Maya on Fourth Street, and eat really nice salmon at Bitter End on Colorado Street.    I could have concluded my weeklong tour with a bowl of, perhaps, Austin's hottest chili at Texas Chili parlor on LaVaca, but instead, I went out for the sizzling lamb and hummus-dolmeh-tabbouleh offerings at Ararat, a cozy, dimly lit restaurant on North Loop Boulevard.     As my nontourist life began to re-emerge, I remembered one last thing. I jumped in my car and drove to the Congress Avenue bridge, where joggers pause to look over the railing at the scullers and families come at dusk to see the nightly aerobatics of one of Austin's biggest attractions -- a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats. At dusk, I'd heard, they come swirling up the river, a million-strong, swooping and circling, finally settling under arches of the bridge. I got there, and waited.    But I was out of season. The bats were out of town -- to return again in April. Evidently they, too, are hooked. There's a truism about Austin that locals are fond of telling: anybody who comes to this live-and-let-live city will come back again.    Finding L.B.J., SXSW and O.

	data-description="ONE way to sum up Austin is to paraphrase an old Texas saying: Defining the town is like herding cats. As the capital of Texas and home to one of the largest universities in the country, Austin is an ideological melting pot: a literary haven and a slackers' den, a music mecca and a film-industry outpost. Dreadlocks and multicolored coifs are as common as pompadours, shags, Hillary bobs, flattops and, in the folksy diners and suburban malls, the Big Blond Do.    Austin has claims to Lyndon B. Johnson and Janis Joplin, Gov. George W. Bush and the columnist Molly Ivins. It nurtures musical generations ranging from Shawn Colvin and Abra Moore to Willie Nelson and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The Butthole Surfers  reside here; so do the world's first permanent photograph, a copy of the Gutenberg Bible and a colony of Mexican bats.     A person is as likely to pass Jimmie Vaughan walking down South Congress or Richard Linklater in the grocery store as to see Jim Wright on a sidewalk near the Legislature or Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman on break from a film shoot, checking out Beckett at the bookstore. Like Portland, Ore., and San Francisco, Austin is a city that feels like a town.    Topographically, Austin presents a similar paradox. I learned this recently from the caretaker of the O. Henry Museum on Fifth Street. Referring to a map made in 1887, the docent outlined the geographic traits that make this the city where the South ends and the West begins. On the west side of Austin, the rugged Balcones Escarpment rises up to mark the beginnings of ranch country, where scrub cedar, cattle and limestone crags freckle the landscape. Just east of town, the Blackland Prairie rolls to a lazy halt, and with it the cotton and soybean fields of the Deep South.     The old map gave me a sense of history and place. But as a relative newcomer to Austin, I had yet to find a cultural blueprint that encompassed the Sixth Street club scene, the grass-roots east side and the annual influx of tourists in March for the South by Southwest music and film festival. I decided that the best solution was to do what Texans do: get in a car and drive.    First, I parked myself in the perennially popular Austin Java Company, off Lamar Boulevard at the western edge of downtown, and over the French Roast-Sumatra blend, planned my attack. I would start with lunch at Cisco's, a patriarch of Tex-Mex dining on the east side, where autographed photos of Kevin Costner and other celebrities dress the dark-paneled walls. Sated with an enchilada plate, I would set out with my friend Joyce in her big-finned 1960 Plymouth Fury. The music would come later.    With highs in the 70's -- just as typical of Austin in midwinter as is an ice storm -- the day called us outdoors. We wandered to Red Bud Isle, a tiny oasis in the middle of Town Lake (created by dams in the Colorado River), where live oaks and cedar and pecan trees shade the sandy, rutted drive. We watched a man fish idly, and gazed at the green outcroppings on the bluff.     From there, we steered north on Exposition Boulevard toward the lush grounds of the Austin Museum of Art at Laguna Gloria on West 35th Street, a hacienda-style space that featured a William Wegman exhibit. We grabbed a spot behind the museum's art school and dangled our feet from a limestone ledge into Lake Austin. Mallards paddled past, a crane glided overhead, a woman paddled her kayak soundlessly.     Austin is physically defined by water. Fed by the Colorado, a strand of lakes and dams nestles against the western edge of the city, flowing down the escarpment from Lake Travis (about 25 minutes west of Austin and favored by scuba-divers), past Mount Bonnell, through Lake Austin and into Town Lake, which bisects the city. Sprinkled throughout town are Big Stacy Pool, a hot-springs-fed swimming pool; the trout-cold depths of Barton Springs and Deep Eddy pool, fronted by Deep Eddy Cabaret, which serves some of the coldest, cheapest beer in town. By boat, visitors could almost see a fourth of the city.    But my friend and I were navigating the greenways in the big white Plymouth, and we headed northwest from the museum to Ski Shores, a 43-year-old hole-in-the-wall a few miles farther up on the lake. Sitting on white plastic lawn chairs in front of the dock, we sipped beer and chatted with the proprietor, George Levy, who said that like many gems of Austin, his establishment battles dueling desires to draw new customers and maintain a laid-back atmosphere.    As the sun began to set, we headed back toward town. Driving an old car is the perfect way to negotiate Austin, not only because Texans love big automobiles, but also because the city nurses a longstanding love affair with vintage cars. You see them wedged between Mercedes Benzes, Land Cruisers and Buicks with ''Save Our Springs'' and ''Bicycles Not Bombs'' bumper stickers.    Likewise, Austinites cherish vintage clothing, furniture, Western wear, eyeglasses, you name it -- evidenced by the bustling funk of South Congress, where a strip of contra-chic second-hand stores and antiques shops represents Austin cool: places like New Bohemia, Electric Ladyland, Terra Toys, Yard Dog (a folk art gallery) are interspersed with restaurants that double as music venues, like El Sol y La Luna, Guero's and Shaggy's. Anchoring the night scene is the ever-retro Continental Club, a spacious hangout where the fashion is slick hair and Lucky Strikes.     The South Congress shopping area is a fine place to while away the early afternoon, after, say, a morning tour of the capitol. An 1888 faded red granite copy of the nation's Capitol, it is the tallest state capitol in the country and despite the development of high-rise hotels and the burgeoning of sleek shopping centers, its presence dominates downtown.     Other historic sites in the central district include St. Mary's Cathedral on East 10th, a limestone Gothic church built in 1874; the Littlefield Building, a neo-classical revival structure on the corner of Congress and Sixth Street; the dusty-hued Driskill Hotel, a Richardsonian-Romanesque affair circa 1886, where L.B.J. and other pols have kept suites and South by Southwest festivalgoers set up camp; and the General Land Office Building, a 140-year-old structure that is the capitol's visitor center, at 11th and Brazos Streets.    Another important part of Austin's history is the University of Texas. Since parking is problematic, it's best to take a cab there, where creeks and live oaks are punctuated by the white neo-classical tower that is one of 19 buildings on campus designed by Paul Cret, best known for the Detroit Institute of Arts.    But go to the university mainly for the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery, whose fine collection has been enhanced by the 20th-century American art collection of the late James Michener and his wife, Mari. Or go for the colossal Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum, which houses plenty of L.B.J. memorabilia but also American political mementoes from Washington to Clinton.    And go for the Harry H. Ransom Humanities Research Center, which contains a rare complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible, and the first permanent photographic image -- a view from the artist Joseph Nicephore Niepce's window in Burgundy -- which Niepce produced on a pewter plate in 1826. Also, in the first-floor gallery of the research center is an intriguing collection of writer and celebrity paraphernalia -- Edgar Allan Poe's mother-of-pearl coin purse,  Gloria Swanson's sunglasses, John Philip Sousa's baton.     The Ransom center also houses some of the most comprehensive photographic, literary, film and design archives in the world -- but they are available only for research, which means that you must be a scholar in one of these fields. I am not a scholar, so I contented myself with the Huntington and Swanson's sunglasses -- although I did yearn for a look at the Hemingway and Faulkner manuscripts.     The next stop was the O. Henry Museum, the quaint, Victorian cottage of the short-story writer William Sydney Porter, a North Carolinian who came to Austin and met his wife, Ethel, and worked in a bank. The house contained furniture from the Porters' days there, and the tour guide explained how Porter became the writer O. Henry after being imprisoned for embezzlement.    I then stopped at my favorite watering hole, the Dog and Duck Pub on West 17th Street, for a Bass ale and a jalapeno-bacon Willie burger. Later, I meandered northeast for the kitschy environs of the Carousel Lounge, where oldtimers do the lindy to a one-man-band.     I then shot back south to another surreal slice of Austin: Ego's, the darkest, cheesiest, Tom Jonesiest lounge in town. Hidden in an apartment complex off South Congress, Ego's is the roost of the pianist Bobby Doyle on Thursday and Friday, and its red walls and rickety bucket seats will send you into a time warp.    On other nights, I prowled Club de Ville, the hipster hangout with an out-back cocktail garden nestled into a limestone grotto; the Ritz Lounge for tango; Highlife Cafe for an art opening; Waterloo Brewery for pool; the Cedar Door for a Mexican martini. In between, I hit galleries like Women & Their Work, which had a fine installation of sculptures made of crepe myrtle by the Dallas artist Sherry Owens, and Flatbed Press, a print studio and gallery showing  wood block prints by Ann Conner.    I also visited the intimate portrait gallery and grounds of the Elisabet Ney Museum in the Hyde Park district, north of the university. This was the studio of Ney, the German sculptor patronized by Garibaldi and King Ludwig II of Bavaria, after relocating to Austin in the 1890's. She created the likenesses of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin at the entrance to the capitol's rotunda.    I made time to eat at Sam's Bar-B-Cue on East 12th (a seminal late-night musicians' haunt, canonized by Stevie Ray and company), grab coffee and imported smokes at Ruta Maya on Fourth Street, and eat really nice salmon at Bitter End on Colorado Street.    I could have concluded my weeklong tour with a bowl of, perhaps, Austin's hottest chili at Texas Chili parlor on LaVaca, but instead, I went out for the sizzling lamb and hummus-dolmeh-tabbouleh offerings at Ararat, a cozy, dimly lit restaurant on North Loop Boulevard.     As my nontourist life began to re-emerge, I remembered one last thing. I jumped in my car and drove to the Congress Avenue bridge, where joggers pause to look over the railing at the scullers and families come at dusk to see the nightly aerobatics of one of Austin's biggest attractions -- a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats. At dusk, I'd heard, they come swirling up the river, a million-strong, swooping and circling, finally settling under arches of the bridge. I got there, and waited.    But I was out of season. The bats were out of town -- to return again in April. Evidently they, too, are hooked. There's a truism about Austin that locals are fond of telling: anybody who comes to this live-and-let-live city will come back again.    Finding L.B.J., SXSW and O.

                    <p>ONE way to sum up Austin is to paraphrase an old Texas saying: Defining the town is like herding cats. As the capital of Texas and home to one of the largest universities in the country, Austin is an ideological melting pot: a literary haven and a slackers' den, a music mecca and a film-industry outpost. Dreadlocks and multicolored coifs are as common as pompadours, shags, Hillary bobs, flattops and, in the folksy diners and suburban malls, the Big Blond Do.</p><p>Austin has claims to Lyndon B. Johnson and Janis Joplin, Gov. George W. Bush and the columnist Molly Ivins. It nurtures musical generations ranging from Shawn Colvin and Abra Moore to Willie Nelson and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The Butthole Surfers  reside here; so do the world's first permanent photograph, a copy of the Gutenberg Bible and a colony of Mexican bats.</p><p>A person is as likely to pass Jimmie Vaughan walking down South Congress or Richard Linklater in the grocery store as to see Jim Wright on a sidewalk near the Legislature or Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman on break from a film shoot, checking out Beckett at the bookstore. Like Portland, Ore., and San Francisco, Austin is a city that feels like a town.</p><p>Topographically, Austin presents a similar paradox. I learned this recently from the caretaker of the O. Henry Museum on Fifth Street. Referring to a map made in 1887, the docent outlined the geographic traits that make this the city where the South ends and the West begins. On the west side of Austin, the rugged Balcones Escarpment rises up to mark the beginnings of ranch country, where scrub cedar, cattle and limestone crags freckle the landscape. Just east of town, the Blackland Prairie rolls to a lazy halt, and with it the cotton and soybean fields of the Deep South.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The old map gave me a sense of history and place. But as a relative newcomer to Austin, I had yet to find a cultural blueprint that encompassed the Sixth Street club scene, the grass-roots east side and the annual influx of tourists in March for the South by Southwest music and film festival. I decided that the best solution was to do what Texans do: get in a car and drive.</p><p>First, I parked myself in the perennially popular Austin Java Company, off Lamar Boulevard at the western edge of downtown, and over the French Roast-Sumatra blend, planned my attack. I would start with lunch at Cisco's, a patriarch of Tex-Mex dining on the east side, where autographed photos of Kevin Costner and other celebrities dress the dark-paneled walls. Sated with an enchilada plate, I would set out with my friend Joyce in her big-finned 1960 Plymouth Fury. The music would come later.</p><p>With highs in the 70's -- just as typical of Austin in midwinter as is an ice storm -- the day called us outdoors. We wandered to Red Bud Isle, a tiny oasis in the middle of Town Lake (created by dams in the Colorado River), where live oaks and cedar and pecan trees shade the sandy, rutted drive. We watched a man fish idly, and gazed at the green outcroppings on the bluff.</p><p>From there, we steered north on Exposition Boulevard toward the lush grounds of the Austin Museum of Art at Laguna Gloria on West 35th Street, a hacienda-style space that featured a William Wegman exhibit. We grabbed a spot behind the museum's art school and dangled our feet from a limestone ledge into Lake Austin. Mallards paddled past, a crane glided overhead, a woman paddled her kayak soundlessly.</p><p>Austin is physically defined by water. Fed by the Colorado, a strand of lakes and dams nestles against the western edge of the city, flowing down the escarpment from Lake Travis (about 25 minutes west of Austin and favored by scuba-divers), past Mount Bonnell, through Lake Austin and into Town Lake, which bisects the city. Sprinkled throughout town are Big Stacy Pool, a hot-springs-fed swimming pool; the trout-cold depths of Barton Springs and Deep Eddy pool, fronted by Deep Eddy Cabaret, which serves some of the coldest, cheapest beer in town. By boat, visitors could almost see a fourth of the city.</p><p>But my friend and I were navigating the greenways in the big white Plymouth, and we headed northwest from the museum to Ski Shores, a 43-year-old hole-in-the-wall a few miles farther up on the lake. Sitting on white plastic lawn chairs in front of the dock, we sipped beer and chatted with the proprietor, George Levy, who said that like many gems of Austin, his establishment battles dueling desires to draw new customers and maintain a laid-back atmosphere.</p><p>As the sun began to set, we headed back toward town. Driving an old car is the perfect way to negotiate Austin, not only because Texans love big automobiles, but also because the city nurses a longstanding love affair with vintage cars. You see them wedged between Mercedes Benzes, Land Cruisers and Buicks with ''Save Our Springs'' and ''Bicycles Not Bombs'' bumper stickers.</p><p>Likewise, Austinites cherish vintage clothing, furniture, Western wear, eyeglasses, you name it -- evidenced by the bustling funk of South Congress, where a strip of contra-chic second-hand stores and antiques shops represents Austin cool: places like New Bohemia, Electric Ladyland, Terra Toys, Yard Dog (a folk art gallery) are interspersed with restaurants that double as music venues, like El Sol y La Luna, Guero's and Shaggy's. Anchoring the night scene is the ever-retro Continental Club, a spacious hangout where the fashion is slick hair and Lucky Strikes.</p>                </div>
