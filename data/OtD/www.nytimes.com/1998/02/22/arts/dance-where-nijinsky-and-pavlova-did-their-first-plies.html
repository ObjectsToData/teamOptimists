    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="RUSSIAN BALLET has fascinated audiences in the West for nearly 100 years, and anyone who wants to know why can find out this week, when a group of young dancers from St. Petersburg arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Starting Wednesday, 65 students of the renowned Vaganova Ballet Academy will appear in four performances with recent graduates who are now stars of the Kirov Ballet.    The Vaganova (pronounced va-GAHN-uh-vah) Academy has generally been regarded as the greatest school of dance in the Western world. Balletomanes touring Russia stop in St. Petersburg to gaze reverentially at the musty classrooms that produced luminous dancers like Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov. For political and economic reasons, pupils in the Vaganova Academy have never before appeared in New York, and they arrive now several years after the appearances of two other acclaimed schools: the Bolshoi Ballet Academy of Moscow and the Paris Opera Ballet School.

Starting Wednesday, 65 students of the renowned Vaganova Ballet Academy will appear in four performances with recent graduates who are now stars of the Kirov Ballet.</p><p>The Vaganova (pronounced va-GAHN-uh-vah) Academy has generally been regarded as the greatest school of dance in the Western world. Balletomanes touring Russia stop in St. Petersburg to gaze reverentially at the musty classrooms that produced luminous dancers like Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov. For political and economic reasons, pupils in the Vaganova Academy have never before appeared in New York, and they arrive now several years after the appearances of two other acclaimed schools: the Bolshoi Ballet Academy of Moscow and the Paris Opera Ballet School.</p><p>With the Kirov soloists, the Vaganova students, ages 11 to 17, will perform eight dances, including excerpts from favorites by Marius Petipa like ''Giselle,'' ''La Bayadere'' and ''Don Quixote'' as well as ''The Little Humpbacked Horse,'' a rarity little known outside Russia. On Saturday afternoon, the Vaganova corps will present a special program, led by the school's artistic director, Igor Belsky, intended to demonstrate their system of training. They will also perform that day with students from New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet, which was founded by George Balanchine, himself a 1921 graduate of the Vaganova Academy when it was called the Petrograd State Choreographic School. It was renamed the Vaganova Academy in 1957.</p><p>This academy was founded in St. Petersburg in 1738, but its present name reflects the genius of a woman who died in 1951. By the time the ballerina Agrippina Vaganova began teaching there in 1921, Russia had acquired a trove of saltatory art and experience. Yet this treasure very nearly disappeared, a casualty of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Vaganova's first great accomplishment was to protect the ballet from destruction.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Her achievement went beyond preservation. During 29 years as teacher of the academy's graduating class, Vaganova used her analytical intelligence to standardize the curriculum. She dissected the classical vocabulary, discovering the mechanics of each step and determining the logic behind combinations. Scrutinizing both muscular and emotional processes, she arrived at what is now referred to as the Vaganova Method. This method distilled the essence of the Russian classical tradition and style that had evolved over the years, synthesizing French, Italian and Russian influences, and the Vaganova syllabus further reflected the athletic demands of 20th-century Soviet choreography.</p><p>Blending form with emotion was key. ''The goal,'' said Ms. Makarova, ''was to help ballet students develop a sense of movement, using technical exercises as a means to reveal their inner emotional potential.''</p><p>When Vaganova published her pedagogy in 1934, under the title ''Fundamentals of Classical Dance,'' she helped raise ballet to a new plateau. Vaganova can be compared to Louis XIV's ballet master Pierre Beauchamp, who is credited with standardizing the five positions of the feet. Her book, a milestone similar to Carlo Blasis's 1830 ''Code of Terpsichore,'' established her as a master educator of 20th-century dance.</p><p>The academy is still run largely as it was in Vaganova's day, and getting into it is not easy. Examiners choose only 50 students -- 30 girls and 20 boys -- from thousands of hopefuls who present themselves each year, underscoring the fact that ballet in Russia remains a source of national pride in the midst of economic disarray. The average number of students in each classroom, 12, remains the same as when the academy was founded.</p><p>Students graduate at age 17 with a baccalaureate degree, which approximates two years at an American college. The curriculum includes a complete course of study in the humanities, with specialized classes in the history of theater, music, art and ballet; acting classes in the Stanislavsky method, and lessons in piano and music theory and appreciation.</p><p>Various kinds of dance classes -- historical, character and a mixture of modern and jazz -- supplement the ballet instruction. The young people study pas de deux as a separate subject, and they learn the entire corps de ballet repertory of the Kirov. The academy also offers graduate programs for aspiring teachers, choreographers and ballet accompanists. Everyone who teaches in the school has taken a four-year teachers' program devised by Vaganova.</p><p>An awareness of tradition contributes mightily to the students' education. ''The most significant thing about the Vaganova School,'' Ms. Makarova recalled of her time there, ''was the daily, unobtrusive feeling of contact with the great ballet of the past, its traditions and unwritten laws.''</p><p>While Mr. Belsky favors acquainting his charges with contemporary Western choreography, he has no plans to tamper with the school's basic method of teaching, he said. As he pointed out, the present system ''gives very good results.''</p><p>Contributing to these results is the sheer physical rigor of the dance classes. Ms. Makarova characterized the school's atmosphere as one of ''life in service of the arts.'' Mr. Belsky, one of Ms. Makarova's former teachers, described the ambiance more bluntly. ''Severity, severity, and again, severity,'' he said.</p><p>The students who will appear at BAM are well aware of their responsibilities in sustaining a major cultural tradition. In their Saturday program, as the pupils take their places at onstage barres, spectators will be able to examine the fine points of the Vaganova style. These include an emphasis on precision and a special vitality that derives from body awareness.Other trademarks are a flexible back, harmonious coordination of the limbs and elegant hand movements. The dancers' sensitivity to musical phrasing relates in part to their preparation for performance in a dramatic repertory. Outstanding members of the graduating class, according to Mr. Belsky, include Alesia Boiko, Irina Golub and Anton Korsakov, all 17 years old.</p><p>MEANWHILE, THE Kirov soloists will present their specialties, although one of the most talented, Andrei Batalov, will not make the trip. Diana Vishneva, who got rave reviews for her performance in Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' at the New York State Theater last November, is reportedly injured and will also stay home. However, while there has been some confusion about just which members of the Kirov will come to BAM, it looks as if the cool and beautiful Uliana Lopatkina will dance the complete ''Shades'' act from ''La Bayadere,'' partnered by Igor Zelensky.</p><p>David Eden, producer of the BAM event, explained why he wanted the ''Shades'' scene to conclude the program. As a seemingly endless line of ballerinas enters the stage, each one repeating the steps of the one before her, the image symbolizes Russian ballet tradition itself. ''It's about continuity,'' he said.</p><p>Photos: SOLO TURNS  Uliana Lopatkina and Igor Zelensky, stars of the Kirov Ballet, will dance the ''Shades'' act from ''La Bayadere'' at BAM.
