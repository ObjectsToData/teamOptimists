                    <p>TO understand Maxwell L. Anderson, the new director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, you need to know something about the rarefied world of Manhattan private schools. ''I went to Collegiate up through eighth grade,'' he said the other day, ''and had the usual concatenation of classmates who were affluent East Siders, like Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Henry Grunwald's son, Peter, and all the other power brokers' kids. And that was exciting. But I felt constrained. I was rambunctious. I was a rebel.''</p><p>Does he mean he was expelled from school?</p><p>''No,'' he said, looking pensive, ''but I left Collegiate and went to Dalton, which was a more rambunctious place, a place of acting out, a place where the politics of a 13-year- old had more currency.''</p><p>Transferring from one elite school to another might not sound like the height of insurrection, but then Mr. Anderson is not likely to be mistaken for Abbie Hoffman. At 42, he is poised and polished, with slicked-back hair and a rich, gravelly voice. His arrival at the Whitney has prompted speculation that New York's most trendy museum has decided to atone and go conservative, entrusting its future to a seeming traditionalist, a man who's the grandson of the celebrated playwright Maxwell Anderson and who received his academic training in, of all things, Greek and Roman art. Just a week ago, Mr. Anderson announced some dramatic curatorial changes, further reinforcing the impression of an all-new, all-sober Whitney.</p>                </div>

                    <p>But let's not jump to conclusions. To meet Mr. Anderson, who was previously the director of the Art Gallery of Ontario, in Toronto, is to realize he's a contradictory figure: a classicist enamored of cutting-edge art.</p><p>''I like photographic-based art, and I'm very interested in the merging of cameras and computers,'' he said on a recent Wednesday morning, sitting in the museum's conference room and sipping a glass of fizzy water.</p><p>As an example, he cited a work he had just purchased for the Whitney's collection, ''In a Garden So Green,'' by Meghan Boody, a 34-year-old New York artist. The piece is a large-scale digital photograph, a computer-generated historical fantasy in which the six wives of Henry VIII meet up in a castle garden for a predictably stressful afternoon.</p><p>Does Mr. Anderson feel any commitment to artists who work in the considerably older medium of painting?</p><p>''That depends on how you define painting,'' he replied, perhaps in parody of President Clinton's verbal ballet. ''What's happening in painting is that it's no longer seen as being sufficient unto itself. A lot of artists are feeling a need to connect it with other media. And the prevailing winds are what you have to be aware of in this profession.''</p><p>Such comments may not qualify as a passionate defense of the mainstream traditions of American art. And they could probably induce cardiac arrest among oil-on-canvas loyalists. As if to offer reassurance that his penchant for new media does not preclude supporting the work of artists who still use paint and brushes (remember brushes?), Mr. Anderson mentioned that he recently had dinner with Terry Winters, met Kenneth Noland for drinks and had an enjoyable chat with Brice Marden in the museum's galleries, his first-ever encounter with each of these artists.</p><p>Mr. Anderson arrived at the Whitney in September, following the departure of David A. Ross, now the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. It's hard to think of another director who weathered more criticism than Mr. Ross, an avatar of the achingly hip. In retrospect, however, the shows that went up during his tenure seem less memorable than the bookstore that went under; Books &amp; Company, which occupied a storefront owned by the Whitney, closed up shop last year, unable to afford a rent increase. Its treatment was widely protested and became a symbol of how many in the art world view the Whitney as a whole, a place with no room for people who still like to read books and talk about something besides real estate.</p><p>The Whitney is easy to criticize, but in truth it's also easy to love. It has always been the most homey of New York's major museums. Other institutions may cover more territory: the Metropolitan's holdings go back 5,000 years, the Museum of Modern Art transports us to the prewar avant-garde of Paris, and the Guggenheim is conquering new continents as you read this. But the Whitney's provincialism is precisely what defines its charm. The museum, founded in 1930, is limited to American art, and when we wander the galleries and take in the classics, like Georgia O'Keeffe's close-ups of flowers or Edward Hopper's lonely-guy scenes, we remember that these artists once walked the streets of New York. And it can be exhilarating to recall their story, an upbeat one about how American artists began this century as neglected paupers and ended it as kings. As Mr. Anderson says, ''Everyone in the world is deeply mindful of American culture.''</p><p>Mr. Anderson was born in Manhattan in 1956, the younger of two boys, and grew up in a distinguished family. His grandfather -- prolific, vastly popular, a Pulitzer prize winner -- earned his fame in the 1930's for plays like ''Elizabeth the Queen'' and ''Mary of Scotland,'' historical dramas in verse that made the European past accessible to Americans. ''My grandfather died when I was 3,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''so I knew him mainly as a legend. There's a book called '11 Verse Plays,' and there was no way to avoid reading it growing up where I did.''</p>                </div>
