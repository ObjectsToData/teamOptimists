                    <p>When Gert Holle began to prepare to become a Lutheran minister more than eight years ago, he braced himself for arduous studies followed by hard work and modest pay.</p><p>But now, five months before he is supposed to take his vows, the 33-year-old seminarian faces the one prospect he did not anticipate: unemployment. For the first time in memory, the bishop here announced recently that the church has jobs for only a fraction of the 48 seminarians who will graduate in May.</p><p>So after spending years studying theology, Greek and Latin, Mr. Holle is now cramming for a backup career in public relations. ''At least in public relations you are working with people,'' he said glumly, as he stirred a cup of tea in his sparsely furnished apartment.</p><p>Mr. Holle's problem stems not from a crisis of faith, but rather a crisis in tax revenues. Under an unusual century-old system, religious institutions in Germany get almost all their revenue from a 9 percent church surtax imposed on the income tax of every registered Catholic, Protestant and Jew.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Taxpayers are asked to declare their religion on their income tax returns, and churchgoers are pressed to register their religion with the Government. Those who are not members of the religions covered by the tax do not pay it, nor do those who have taken the bureaucratic step of revoking their registration.</p><p>Church taxes totaled about $11 billion in 1996, almost as much as the sin tax on cigarettes. In striking contrast to the United States, with its separation of church and state, Germany uses its religion taxes for the salaries of priests and rabbis, the construction of churches and a sprawling array of church-run social programs, from Christian day-care centers and kindergartens to drug-counseling clinics and hospitals.</p><p>But now the church-state partnership is cracking. With 4.3 million Germans, or more than 11 percent of the work force, unemployed, and thus paying no taxes, church revenue fell about 4 percent in 1996. It could have plunged as much as 10 percent in 1997. That would represent a combined drop in revenues for all religions of more than $1 billion.</p><p>Here in the state of Hesse, the Protestant hierarchy slashed $40 million out of its $500 million budget in 1997 and for each of the next five years. In Stuttgart, home of Daimler-Benz, struggling officials have cut money for social programs and international aid. In Saxony, in eastern Germany, the Protestant churches are gearing up to sell or rent as many as 200 empty church buildings.</p><p>''The problems will not end quickly,'' said Bishop Peter Steinacker, who oversees the Protestant churches in the west German region of Hesse-Nassau. ''All the economic predictions call for more than four million unemployed over the next two, three or four years. As long as unemployment stays high, the financial situation will not get any better.''</p><p>Germany's church tax supports three main religious groups: the Evangelical Churches, an umbrella organization of Protestants that oversees the Lutheran, Reform and United Protestant branches; Roman Catholicism, and Judaism. Protestants, most of them Lutherans, account for 45 percent of the German population, with Roman Catholics at 37 percent. Jews represent only a small percentage. Muslims and others are not part of the tax structure.</p><p>Much like German industry, German religion is now preaching the need to cut costs, become more efficient and refocus priorities. In Munich, Protestant leaders even got a free strategic analysis from the management consultants McKinsey &amp; Company. And they are talking about trying to wean themselves, at least partly, from the tax system.</p><p>In early November, Protestant leaders in Hesse announced plans to cut 25 percent of spending on 19 programs, like psychological counseling and adult education. Pastors will also be sent into retirement as soon as they turn 60, while new seminarians will be kept out. In addition, the church will sharply reduce its extensive support for kindergartens and cut the number of religion teachers it sends to public schools.</p><p>Over the next five years, church leaders in Hesse seek substantial cuts in the ranks of pastors. Their numbers have kept pace through the years with the growing wealth of both Germany and its churches, swelling to about 1,800, from about 1,200 in 1970. Church officials say they want to reduce that number, probably by several hundred.</p><p>''We became, really, a little fat,'' said Joachim Schmidt, a spokesman for the Protestant church in Hesse.</p><p>Though revenues have been stagnant for several years now, church officials say they were blindsided by the decline in 1997. For the first time ever here, seminarians will have to choose between unemployment and a change in career.</p><p>''We have tried to avoid unemployment among ministers,'' Bishop Steinacker said, ''but there were simply too many. We couldn't anticipate the development of the economy.''</p><p>Mr. Holle and many of his classmates were shocked as well as infuriated by the news. Most of them have spent at least eight years preparing for the ministry -- at a cost to the church of more than $100,000 per person. After graduating from college, they often spent years in church-sponsored social work or serving as deacons in small parishes. Then there is a two-year program of theology and pastoral work, and students are normally not admitted to this last step unless the church is certain that there will be positions for them when they finish.</p>                </div>
