From her vast stock, Romana Javitz (1903-1980) could find you a picture of anything. As chief custodian and cultivator of the New York Public Library's Picture Collection from 1929 to 1968, Ms. Javitz helped it grow from a modest resource to a major repository of five million items that reflect the ever-changing shifts in popular taste.    Although the library is much better known as a source of linear learning, it is also one of the great centers for pictorial research, used by artists, designers, publishers, illustrators, television prop staffs, advertising people, Web site developers, students, historians and others wanting ideas and documentation. Its Picture Collection circulates material from books, magazines, catalogues, pamphlets and advertisements, as well as from prints, movie stills, postcards and photographs, filed under nearly 12,000 subject headings.

Although the library is much better known as a source of linear learning, it is also one of the great centers for pictorial research, used by artists, designers, publishers, illustrators, television prop staffs, advertising people, Web site developers, students, historians and others wanting ideas and documentation.

Its Picture Collection circulates material from books, magazines, catalogues, pamphlets and advertisements, as well as from prints, movie stills, postcards and photographs, filed under nearly 12,000 subject headings.</p><p>Now, 18 years after Ms. Javitz's death, the library is commemorating her role in making all this happen. ''Subject Matters: Photography, Romana Javitz and the New York Public Library'' is a small but, despite its uncatchy title, lively show. It presents an overview of the Picture Collection and its development, along with some of the more than 2,000 photographs she acquired from such luminaries as Lewis W. Hine, Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and Berenice Abbott, among others.</p><p>The Picture Collection started informally in 1914 as a response to growing demand for pictorial material viewed in terms of subject rather than esthetics. By 1926 the expanding file had been given its own space, and in 1929 Ms. Javitz, who initially worked part-time at the library while studying painting, took over.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''She saw the Picture Collection as an encyclopedia of visual knowledge, and built a useful system for the dissemination of that knowledge,'' writes Anthony T. Troncale, associate head of the Digital Imaging Unit in the library's Preservation Division, who organized the show with Julia Van Haaften, curator of the Photography Collection in the Division of Art, Prints and Photographs.</p><p>One of Ms. Javitz's salient contributions was devising an up-to-date indexing system that made pictures readily accessible by subject matter. Seeking ''Relationships,'' for instance, you might look under Conversation, Courtship, Love, Kissing, Marriage or Erotica. And she also encouraged borrowers to draw, rather than write, their requests. Whisky stills, Queen Victoria and nudes are some of the quirkily illustrated call slips on view in the show. A signed scenario for a projected film about a photographer by Joseph Cornell, a Picture Collection user who became a Javitz friend, is there, and a 1995 cartoon strip about the collection by Art Spiegelman that includes a three-panel view of Ms. Javitz plying her trade with a pair of scissors.</p><p>Another significant contribution to the field of visual research came about through her concern over the neglect of American folk arts and crafts. In 1935, she, along with artist-users of the collection, hatched a proposal (its typescript is on view in the show) under which the New Deal's Works Progress Administration would hire unemployed artists and illustrators to document American decorative arts. Thousands of watercolors recording everything from toys to quilts to clothes to iron railings were produced. Now ensconced at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, as the Index of American Design, the collection forms a significant record of indigenous American crafts.</p><p>Much of the show's space is given to works from the group of photographs that Ms. Javitz acquired over the years, sometimes as gifts from photographers, which is now separated out as the Romana Javitz Collection. She chose them more for their subject matter than as works of art. ''As a librarian,'' she said in an interview, ''I find that I want very much to read the facts in the photograph.''</p><p>Hine, befriended by Ms. Javitz late in his life, is represented by five documentary prints, among them a touching 1910 scene of a little boy working at midnight in a glass factory. Photographs by Lange include a 1934 view of an assembly of unemployed men in San Francisco, surprisingly well-dressed and wearing snappy fedoras. A 1938 shot by Abbott shows the French liner Normandie in the North River, cheered by a crowd on shore.</p><p>Among Ms. Javitz's most important acquisitions, in 1936 and 1937, were duplicates from the photographic division of the Federal Resettlement Administration (later known as the Farm Security Administration). A New Deal agency, set up to help farmers displaced by drought and economic ruin, it had a division that hired talented photographers to document the farmers' plight. One was the artist Ben Shahn, a friend of Ms. Javitz, who suggested to Roy D. Stryker, chief of the agency's photo division, that it provide the Picture Collection with duplicates. And thereby hangs a tale.</p><p>From the initial shipments, in 1936 and 1937, came such works as Shahn's 1935 photo of a North Carolina fiddler at home on a Sunday afternoon, Evans's 1936 study of black men in front of a Vicksburg, Miss., barber shop and Arthur Rothstein's stark 1935 night shot of a stretch of highway in the Texas Panhandle. But by the early 1940's, with economic conditions looking up, the agency was pushed by certain Congressmen to project a more positive image of America.</p><p>During World War II, a number of the agency's 180,000 images came to the Picture Collection clandestinely, in anonymous packages, while Congress threatened to impound its files as un-American. Later it turned out that Stryker, alarmed over that possibility, wanted to make sure that a duplicate file would be available in New York. But he didn't dare to send them officially until the threat was removed. That happened in 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a directive giving the Farm Security archive to the Library of Congress.</p><p>After World War II Ms. Javitz kept on acquiring, by gift or purchase, the documentary work of American photographers, making the Picture Collection one of the few institutions willing to take on young contemporaries. For some reason, she eschewed what is now known as the New York School of Photographers, including Diane Arbus and Robert Frank. With some notable exceptions, like Helen Levitt, her choices are mostly unknown today. The best of the works on view are urban vignettes, like Ann Treer's 1963 look at tough neighborhood kids on West 20th Street, David Turner's 1962 shot of a well-hatted pair of loquacious subway riders and a 1963 homage to a broken doll in the street by Beuford Smith, one of several black photographers whose work entered the collection in the 1960's.</p><p>It is a challenge in a small exhibition to represent the work of a system as vast and varied as the Picture Collection, now slowly being digitized, as a computer in the show gives evidence. And perhaps the library has not given the Picture Collection part of the show enough space and explanation. But as a tribute to Ms. Javitz and her innovative role in the art world, the exhibition is a real occasion.</p><p>''Subject Matters: Photography, Romana Javitz and the New York Public Library'' is at the library's Center for the Humanities, Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, through March 28.</p><p>Photo: Romana Javitz, as portrayed by Art Spiegelman in a cartoon that was first published in The New Yorker.
