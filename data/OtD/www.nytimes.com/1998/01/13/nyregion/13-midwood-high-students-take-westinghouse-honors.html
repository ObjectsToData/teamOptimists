Despite having to contend with severe overcrowding, antiquated labs without hot water or exhaust systems and biology counseling sessions that take place in an odorous boys' bathroom, Midwood High School posted 13 semifinalists in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search this year. In the process, it edged out the Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, which tied for second both in New York State and, along with a school in Silver Spring, Md., in the nation, with 12 semifinalists each.

And Midwood's underdog victory did not escape its students.</p><p>''I hate to say it, because I don't want to put down other schools,'' said Sze Kwan Chan, one of the Midwood semifinalists, ''but yes, there's a lot of competition, especially between Stuyvesant and us. And sometimes it's really unfair looking at the things they have and we don't. But this proves to other people that we can do it.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>All 13 of the Midwood semifinalists are seniors who live in Brooklyn and came from the school's highly competitive magnet program, in which 8,000 students a year from all over the city compete for 500 freshman slots, either in medical science or the humanities. While Stuyvesant and Bronx Science require admissions exams, Midwood students are admitted based on their junior high school marks, attendance and standardized test scores. Once in the school, the 2,000 magnet students mix with another 2,000 students from the surrounding neighborhood in Flatbush, sharing many of the same classes.</p><p>The high expectations are contagious, said Midwood's principal, Lewis Frohlich. More than 70 percent of the students earn Regents diplomas, compared with nearly 25 percent citywide, the dropout rate is less than 2 percent, and about 99 percent of those who graduate go on to college, Mr. Frohlich said.</p><p>While it is almost a cliche to say so, Midwood's Westinghouse semifinalists are as diverse as New York City. Six are foreign born, including two Russians, two Chinese and two from Hong Kong. Jared Ravi Jagdeo tells how his grandfather came from Trinidad. And Hesky Fisher, who was raised in the Hasidic community of Williamsburg, had to push hard against the wishes of his father to transfer to Midwood from a yeshiva last year so that he could get a better science education.</p><p>They all look startled when someone asks if they are considered nerdy science nuts. At Midwood, being a science nut, apparently, is a good way to make friends, and being ambitious is far from shameful. ''I came here because of the legacy,'' Mr. Jagdeo said.</p><p>Anna Kundel, who came from Moldavia in 1992, explained that her grandmother and her mother always qualified for gold medals in academics in the Soviet Union but did not get them, because of discrimination against Jews. ''There's lots of pressure if your parents are from another country,'' she said. ''I want to be like them.''</p><p>The inspiration for the semifinalists' winning projects came from often humble sources. Mr. Fisher said he became addicted to science when he was a small boy, after he made a mess of his parents' kitchen by trying out an experiment from a science book -- mixing vinegar and baking soda to create a volcano. His Westinghouse competition project involves unleashing bacteria to clean up polluted soil.</p><p>Another semifinalist, Svetlana Zapolskaya, thought of her project on diagnosing Alzheimer's disease while visiting her mother at her job as an activities director at a nursing home. And Kenneth Miu became fascinated by science when, at the age of 6, he stuck his finger in an electric socket.</p><p>''I got a big shock and my father yelled at me,'' he recalled. ''I was stunned. I wanted to know how did this happen.''</p><p>Because the Midwood labs are outdated, the Westinghouse scholars use them only for basic science, research methodology and ethics courses. For more extensive research, they use laboratories at institutions that have agreed to provide mentors, including Brooklyn College, Maimonides Medical Center, Downstate Medical Center and Rockefeller University.</p><p>Their parents, the semifinalists said, have been uniformly encouraging, though their understanding of the science projects varies. Hope Rachel Garner, who studied leukemia cells in her project, is the daughter of doctors who let her visit hospitals. Siu Fei Jimmy Seto and Ms. Chan are the children of garment workers; Robert Chen's father is a construction worker, and Mr. Miu's father is a hotel lobby attendant.</p><p>Miss Chan called her father yesterday from school to tell him that she was a finalist.</p><p>''I could tell that he was proud,'' she said. He asked her what she wanted as a reward. ''Something good to eat,'' she replied.</p><p>The 13 Midwood semifinalists were among 144 in the state and 300 in the nation. The other top-ranked schools in the New York City area were three Long Island schools, Ward Melville High School in Setauket, with 10 winners, and Lawrence High School in Cedarhurst and Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School in Port Washington, with 7 each. They were among 1,581 entrants from 149 high schools in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Later this month, 40 finalists will be chosen from among the 300 national semifinalists.</p><p>Photo: Midwood High School's semifinalists for the Westinghouse science awards posed with two teachers and the principal for a school newspaper photo.
