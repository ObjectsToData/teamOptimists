                    <p>Led by a conservatively oriented board of trustees, the State University of New York appears ready to overhaul its undergraduate education by adopting a new core curriculum for all students.</p><p>For a generation or more, many colleges have allowed their students wide latitude in fashioning their own course work. But on Tuesday, the SUNY trustees are expected to adopt a well-defined core curriculum -- roughly a year's worth of courses -- that they deem necessary to produce a well-educated student.</p><p>Ten individual courses will be required -- not only standards like math, natural science, foreign language, Western civilization, humanities and the arts, social sciences and American history, but also less traditional requirements like ''basic communications and reasoning,'' information technology and world civilizations other than Western. The policy will apply to students entering the university in the fall of 2000.</p><p>Conservative groups applauded the measure as adding rigor to SUNY's education, but opponents, including leaders of the university's faculty senate, attacked it as overly restrictive. They also criticized the board for failing to hold public discussion on the specifics of the policy, which were decided this week.</p>                </div>

                    <p>SUNY officials at the Albany headquarters said they had been troubled that students could take easy and narrowly defined courses and graduate without huge swaths of knowledge. ''The most common way students escape broad exposure is by choosing what they will take,'' said Peter Salins, SUNY's provost, in support of the new requirements. ''That is why we need a tight set of requirements.''</p><p>Each college will define its own specifics, but the colleges will be assessed on their programs, and financing from the central university administration will be tied to how well they do.</p><p>Some private institutions, like Columbia University, have clearly designated core requirements that all students must pass, but SUNY officials say they could not find any other public university system that had prescribed such a core for all of its colleges. Columbia's ''great books'' curriculum requires undergraduates to spend nearly half of their freshman and sophomore years studying landmark works in Western civilization. The University of Chicago has a similarly rigorous core.</p><p>But now, after attacks by the conservative National Association of Scholars about the lack of rigor in public higher education, the issue of a core curriculum for state universities has been raised in several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia.  ''There is no doubt that SUNY is a leader here,'' said Tom Carroll, chairman of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education, a conservative research organization in the Albany area.</p><p>Randy Daniels, a trustee and co-chairman of the subcommittee that developed the new policy, said the trustees ''are committed to raising academic standards.''</p><p>''Employers, parents and students deserve no less,'' he said.</p><p>SUNY officials said yesterday that the 15-member board appeared to have more than enough votes to pass the new curriculum policy at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. ''I think it will pass,'' said Candace de Russy, another trustee who has pressed for the core requirements.</p><p>Advocates of a tightly prescribed curriculum applauded SUNY's direction, saying that it was the only way to insure that students learned what they needed to become educated citizens and skilled workers.</p><p>''Under the current system, what the students learn is hit or miss,'' said Mr. Carroll, who wrote a study in 1996 that criticized SUNY standards. ''SUNY's new general-education standards would help insure that all of its graduates are broadly educated.''</p><p>But some critics said the policy as drawn up was overly specific and did not leave enough leeway for the colleges or their students.</p><p>''This just flies in the face of the principle that the board has set out that each campus should develop its own distinct mission and academic program,'' said Vincent Aceto, president of SUNY's University Faculty Senate. ''And it clearly reaches over into areas that have traditionally been the prerogative of the faculty.''</p><p>He and others were also incensed that the specific policy was not available for discussion before being put to a vote Tuesday.</p><p>''There's been a lack of discussion of the policy with the affected campuses,'' said Arnold B. Gardner, a longtime trustee who often disagrees with the Pataki-appointed trustees, who he says are trying to micromanage the university. ''There are monetary consequences. There are academic policy issues. And none of this has been discussed.''</p><p>The policy would apply initially to 29 senior college and university campuses, but SUNY's 30 community colleges would be strongly encouraged to go along so that their students could transfer more easily to the four-year colleges. The SUNY campuses at Cornell and Alfred would also be excluded, at least initially, because they are part of larger institutions not part of SUNY.</p><p>The issue of what courses all students must take has long been contentious. Colleges once spelled out what their students must take in more detail. But in recent decades, most colleges and universities have established cafeteria-style systems in which students must take one math course or one English course but have a wide variety of possibilities.</p><p>At a recent trustees' meeting, Mr. Salins, the provost, pointed to a class in the history of tap dance at the university at Stony Brook, one of the four university centers. He said students could use it to satisfy their general education requirements.</p><p>''The issue is not so much the content of the general education curriculum but how seriously the campuses take it,'' he said yesterday. ''In science, students can fudge even that, because there are courses that don't cover basic knowledge and aren't rigorous. They're very specialized and they're gut courses.''</p><p>Some campus administrators like Lois B. DeFleur, president of the highly competitive university at  Binghamton, are concerned that the  core could require expensive shifts among teaching assignments that  faculty would oppose.</p><p>Mr. Salins said that such shifts in teaching were indeed likely, but that he hoped SUNY could give the campuses some money to help underwrite the changes. He has also proposed that the university support the core courses more generously than it does now.</p><p>Mr. Aceto, the university faculty president, said he received calls from 10 SUNY presidents yesterday expressing concern with the board's proposal. ''None of them said, 'This is a great idea,' '' he said. ''But they are afraid to say so publicly because the presidents don't have tenure. The faculty do.''</p>                </div>
