What Robert Scholes proposes in his astute new book, ''The Rise and Fall of English: Reconstructing English as a Discipline,'' sounds simple enough on the face of it. He wants to revise the way English is taught in all our schools by de-emphasizing the study of literature as literature, elevating the instruction of writing and combining the two to form a discipline that would prove more useful to students going out into the world.

                    <p>What Robert Scholes proposes in his astute new book, ''The Rise and Fall of English: Reconstructing English as a Discipline,'' sounds simple enough on the face of it. He wants to revise the way English is taught in all our schools by de-emphasizing the study of literature as literature, elevating the instruction of writing and combining the two to form a discipline that would prove more useful to students going out into the world.</p><p>He writes, ''I think we may at present be too concerned with teaching the right ideas in the classroom and not concerned enough with teaching the most effective ways of speaking, listening, reading and writing.'' For ''it is impossible to deny that language and other semiotic systems and their associated media of communication have in the course of history multiplied and penetrated more and more deeply into our daily lives. We are at present, like it or not, the most mediated human beings ever to exist on this earth.'' And ''to function as a citizen of these United States one needs to be able to read, interpret and criticize texts in a wide range of modes, genres and media.''</p><p>All of which may sound unobjectionable. But it isn't, as the author himself immediately announces. A professor of humanities at Brown University and the author of ''Textual Power: Literary Theory and the Teaching of English,'' among other books, Mr. Scholes warns that his proposals risk offending everyone from professors of literature who see themselves as keepers of some sacred flame and who disdain those who teach mere composition, to ''those who want dramatic indictments and sweeping condemnations of conspiracies to betray Western Civilization as we have known it.''</p><p>Yet his prescriptions are necessary, he argues, because, as things now stand, the system is unreal. Those who study English are being trained for a life of leisurely contemplation of literature they can't possibly live unless perhaps they become English teachers. Those who teach English can't begin to keep up with what is being published even in highly specialized fields. ''One result of all this has been to turn us into professional hypocritics,'' he writes, hypocriticism being a word that ''acknowledges more fully than is usual the roots of hypocrite in the ancient Greek verb hypokrino, which had a set of meanings sliding from simple speech, to orating, to acting on stage, to feigning or speaking falsely.'' He adds, ''We are constantly in danger of following the same trajectory.''</p><p>What he sets out to do in his book is first trace the rise of English studies at Yale and Brown, two American institutions that ''I happen to know well,'' he writes, and whose experiences were reflected in ''other schools, both private and public, that were established after them.'' This rise turns out to connect with the decline of the teaching of rhetoric and oratory, part of a curriculum ''designed to prepare graduates for careers in the church or for participation in civil government.''</p><p>Yet by a complex process that Mr. Scholes details lucidly, the study of literature became a substitute for religious training, providing ''a safe haven for professors, who had become a clergy without a dogma, teaching sacred texts without a God.'' And far from mitigating this tendency, he argues, the rise of the New Criticism and ''the American form of deconstruction'' have, particularly at Yale, served to preserve the sacredness of literature by attempting to keep its ''transcendental aura'' alive.</p><p>So what Mr. Scholes is proposing in ''The Rise and Fall of English'' is simply that the 19th-century trend be reversed, that we ''rethink in modern terms'' the medieval concept of the trivium that was the core of education and that we ''go back to the roots of our liberal arts tradition'' and reinstate the trivium's components, grammar, dialectic and rhetoric, at the core of college education.</p><p>But it is in the rigor of his analysis that you can see the obstacles to what he is proposing. For instance, you can see the difficulties of returning to a search for truth in his brilliant chapterlong argument with neopragmatists like Richard Rorty and Stanley Fish, who deny the possibility of finding objective truth. You can see the challenge of accommodating diverse political outlooks in the curriculum in his insistence that responsible education ''must take the form of establishing a disciplinary framework strong enough to allow the political full play in the study of textuality'' without necessarily giving in to the objectives of political programs.</p><p>And you can see the problems of putting his ideas into practice in the overview of an alternative English course for high-school students he wrote after heading a task force to set the guidelines for the English version of Pacesetter, the College Board's new program to improve high school teaching in mathematics, Spanish and English. The materials for this plan range all the way from Shakespeare's ''Othello'' to Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' to television news reports, all of which Mr. Scholes consider appropriate texts for the study of English.</p><p>Actually, this course has met with some success, Mr. Scholes reports, with some 400 teachers and 21,000 students having been scheduled to use the course in 1996-97. But what is far more impressive is the argument at the core of his proposals that reading and writing or the consumption and production of texts must be merged in the future study of English. Not because all students of literature will become professional writers, but rather because students will become, as he puts it, ''better readers of literature because of their attempts to write it.''</p><p>In this and other practical suggestions Mr. Scholes addresses a problem that he reports Jacques Derrida, the inventor of deconstruction, posing when he spoke as an academic to other academics, in a lecture celebrating the centenary of Columbia University Graduate School. ''We feel bad about ourselves,'' Professor Derrida said. ''Who would dare to say otherwise? And those who feel good about themselves are perhaps hiding something, from others or from themselves.''</p><p>''The Rise and Fall of English'' will make a lot of readers feel better.</p><p>Photo: Robert Scholes  </p>                </div>
