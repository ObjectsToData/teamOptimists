    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Toward the end of this last school year, Theodore R. Sizer, the author and strategist of school reform, was sitting at a long table in the windowless office of the Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School here. Mr. Sizer is a largish, shambling fellow with shaggy brows and merry little eyes, an ironist with a deft sense of human folly. At that moment, however, he had lost his sense of humor. He and his wife, Nancy, had just agreed to become co-principals of Parker, a three-year-old junior and senior high school founded on the progressive principles with which he is associated.    The school does not believe in tracking, grade levels, multiple- choice tests or letter grades. And now the Sizers were getting a dose of school reality: For the previous two weeks, Parker had been forced to yank half its students out of class to take a battery of exams that represents the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's very different idea of school reform. Classes had virtually ground to a halt.  ">

And now the Sizers were getting a dose of school reality: For the previous two weeks, Parker had been forced to yank half its students out of class to take a battery of exams that represents the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's very different idea of school reform. Classes had virtually ground to a halt.</p><p>''The whole notion that a small group of unelected people could decide the ideas that everyone is going to be held accountable for to me is outrageous,'' Mr. Sizer said, fuming. ''Outrageous.''</p><p>The idea of standardized tests, and of statewide curriculum, is not quite so outrageous as all that, but Mr. Sizer's idea of a good school is far from conventional. As head of the Coalition of Essential Schools until his retirement this spring, Mr. Sizer, 66, has been remarkably effective in attracting teachers, administrators and even policy makers to his vision of school as an autonomous community devoted to sophisticated intellectual inquiry.</p>                </div>

                    <p>In his most recent book, ''Horace's Hope: What Works for the American High School'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996) -- Horace, a world-wise high school teacher, is a fictional alter ego -- Mr. Sizer offers stirring vignettes of just such schools. But the stirring vignette is, he knows, the opiate of school reform. He openly concedes his continuing dismay at the resistance the system puts up in the face of change. ''The system carries on,'' he writes, ''even when the carrying on is irrational.''</p><p>Sizer the freshly minted principal couldn't have been surprised at what Sizer the author already knew; after almost 45 years in education, he's not subject to many illusions. Still, he soldiers on. He spoke over coffee at a former officers' club. (Parker is located on a decommissioned military base.)</p><p>''I take real satisfaction with the extent to which some of the ideas which in the mid-80's appeared far out are now in the mainstream,'' he said, citing the notion that children move ahead based on their performance, not their age. ''In my optimistic moments,'' he added, ''I think we've changed the agenda of the national conversation about secondary schools.''</p><p>School innovators tend to be either former teachers or academicians; Mr. Sizer is a teacher who became an academic. When he left the Army in 1955 -- he was briefly stationed at the intelligence center that now serves, coincidentally, as Parker's massive and forbidding home -- he taught English at the Roxbury Latin School in West Roxbury, Mass., and then at a boys grammar school in Australia.</p><p>He got his Ph.D. in education and history at Harvard; taught in the education school and then served as dean, and in 1974 became headmaster of the Phillips Academy at Andover. Mr. Sizer had become increasingly interested in why schools seemed to be doing such a poor job. In 1981, backed by Carnegie and several other foundations, he left Andover and spent a year traveling in the land of high schools. The result was a personal, intentionally unsystematic narrative called ''Horace's Compromise.''</p><p>In it, Mr. Sizer described an academically sterile world governed by a bargain he called the ''conspiracy of the least'' -- you promise to behave if I promise to ask little or nothing of you. He found superintendents who prided themselves on their efficiency as they presided over well-behaved, lifeless schools. But unlike the authors of the famously alarmist 1983 Presidential report ''A Nation at Risk,'' he did not blame the lassitude of the 60's and did not propose a return to tradition.</p><p>''High schools,'' he wrote, ''should respect adolescents more and patronize them less'' -- the kind of plain-spoken, appealing aphorism that helped make ''Horace's Compromise'' perhaps the most discussed school reform book of its time.</p><p>Mr. Sizer contended that students had to be actively engaged in their own learning, allowing schools to set the bar of expectations much higher. In effect, he linked the progressives' faith in the capacities of the child with the conservatives' criticism of school standards.</p><p>He ultimately elaborated nine principles that would guide the kind of alternative school he had in mind, including the doctrine that teaching be personalized and entail coaching rather than imparting; that teachers and principals be able to make important educational decisions for themselves; that the curriculum focus on essential skills -- reading, writing, oral presentation, mathematical problem-solving, scientific investigation -- rather than broadly cover facts; and that students demonstrate ''mastery'' of a subject in so-called exhibitions, in which students give an oral presentation of a paper or project, rather than merely passing tests.</p>                </div>
