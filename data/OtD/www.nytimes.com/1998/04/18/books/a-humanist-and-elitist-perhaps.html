''But would you say that sometimes you smiled? It's not all that grim, is it?''</p>                </div>

                    <p>Mr. Steiner may not quite be the last steadfast witness to and defender of the European intellectual tradition, but he comes pretty close. Born of Viennese Jewish parents in 1929, he was one of two Jews from his lycee class to escape the Holocaust when he came to the United States in 1940. Mr. Steiner's father, a banker whose love was literature, introduced him to ''the Iliad'' at 5; it is an occasion Mr. Steiner recounts in his book with the rapturous excitement a child today might get from his first Nintendo or pair of Air Jordans.</p><p>Mr. Steiner grew up speaking three languages, was educated at the University of Chicago, Harvard and then Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, and has built a remarkably far-ranging literary career as an author and critic whose concerns go beyond literature to the structure of language and how the nature of that communication shapes culture. His sources tend to come almost entirely from various classical traditions of music, literature and art. Thus, the index of his book begins with Abraham; Accidia; Action Francaise; Adam; Adamic; Adams, Henry; Adorno: Beethoven; Aeschylus: ''Oresteia''; aesthetics.</p><p>Indeed, Mr. Steiner's book and career are in many ways a celebration of the virtues of being utterly out of fashion. ''In the 60's, I was teaching amid all the upheaval, but I never had a day of trouble,'' he said. ''The young despise those who are trying to fake it, but they can accept the fact you can be nuts or wrong politically. I walked into my classes and said: 'I'm a reactionary mastodon out of the lost past. You don't need to come to this lecture. But if you do I will explain something to you. I know an embarrassing lot. Terrible. You know almost nothing. I've taken an oath before God to change this equation in your favor. Now shut up.' I didn't have a moment's trouble.''</p><p>Mr. Steiner has been hailed in The Times Literary Supplement as ''the most brilliant cultural journalist at present writing in English or perhaps in any language,'' and criticized elsewhere for excessive self-regard. ''Errata'' (Yale, 1998), which received warm reviews in Britain, got mixed ones in the United States, where some critics have tempered their admiration for Mr. Steiner's intellect with caveats that his insights can be overshadowed by his ego. Other critics have said he had a predilection for expending too much conspicuous scholarship brooding too darkly on the ills of his time. ''Anyone less conspicuously erudite would no doubt be dismissed as an insufferable crank,'' Roger Kimball wrote in The New York Times Book Review in his review of Mr. Steiner's ''Real Presences'' in 1989. ''After all, how many pages can one write about the impossibility of language and communication?''</p><p>Given the waning arc of the elements of high culture that have formed the core of his life, it's not surprising that Mr. Steiner tends to view the world through a dark lens. He worries, for example, that even in the places  entrusted with sustaining the classical traditions -- the universities -- teaching the humanities is becoming ever less rigorous.</p><p>''I wouldn't let anyone get a B.A. in the arts who hasn't been taught some mathematics,'' he said. ''You can't graduate as a literate being without knowing something about what Galileo meant when he said, ''Nature speaks algebra and geometry.' And I'm not talking just about core courses. Core courses are the Readers Digest: prepackaged. Why do we expect so much discipline and pain from an athlete? So much of those going into medicine or law? But of the humanities we ask less and less. We have sold out the past.''</p><p>Still, Mr. Steiner is not totally oblivious to  modern currents. He likes various modern composers, the jazz of Dizzy Gillespie and Dave Brubeck, some country music and American football, even though his appreciation of the game's ''cerebral intricacy and its strange, complex social makeup'' is not likely to get him a job as a sideline color analyst. He views rock music, on the other hand, with profound horror: ''The absolute physical despotism of it. The lights are meant to blind. The noise to deafen. And your body is meant to somehow not be under your volition. That's as near to a Nazi mob as I can imagine.'' The end of his long relationship with the New Yorker last year, a subject that elicits a brisk but polite ''no comment,'' seems another case of the cultural waters flowing in the opposite direction from his instincts.</p><p>To be sure, Mr. Steiner is hardly the only one concerned about the classics or who comes down on the proudly retrograde side of the culture wars. What sets him apart is the degree of passion, the way his whole being seems wrapped up in the issue. He writes in ''Errata'': ''Having been schooled so young and so insistently in the worship (the word is hardly exaggerated) of the classic, I came to ask myself whether our current cultural, intellectual situation is not that of an afterword of a more or less confused epilogue. Will there come again a Plato or a Mozart, a Shakespeare or a Rembrandt, a 'Divine Comedy' or a 'Critique of Pure Judgment?' ''</p><p>To Mr. Steiner, the question resonates on at least three levels. The first is that this ''worship'' is what has made his life worthwhile. The second is his fear that the Western intellectual tradition will not survive. And the third, perhaps most vexing of all, is his puzzlement over how the best of Western civilization has coexisted, sometimes quite amicably, with the most barbarous. ''After 50 years of teaching, the question remains, 'How to explain those who sing Schubert in the evening and torture in the morning?' '' he said. ''I'm going to the end of my life haunted more and more by the question 'Why did the humanities not humanize?' I don't have an answer.''</p><p>Workmen have clattered by, unfolding chairs and putting out tables. The afternoon light has been filtered from a brilliant afternoon glow to something musky and dense. Mr. Steiner rattles on, tossing off literary references in an amiable, seamless flow. If he is not likely to make complete sense of the West's dark cultural epilogue, on this day, at least, he seems to remain reasonably cheerful.</p><p>''At his dying, Wittgenstein, a man I admire unutterably, said, 'Tell them I've had a very happy life,' '' he said in a suitably Steinerian summation. ''No comparison intended. Eighty-eight red lines under that one. I'm not that much of an idiot. But I've had a very lucky life also.''</p><p>Photo: George Steiner, author of ''Errata: An Examined Life,'' at the Harvard Club.
