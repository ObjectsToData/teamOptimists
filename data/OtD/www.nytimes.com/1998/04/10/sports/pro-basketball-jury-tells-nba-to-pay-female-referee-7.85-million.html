                    <p>For years, Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle had dreamed of becoming a referee in the National Basketball Association, but she never got any closer than officiating a few preseason scrimmages for the New Jersey Nets. Convinced that she was a victim of sex discrimination, she sued the league.</p><p>Yesterday, a Federal jury in Manhattan agreed, finding that the league had denied her a job because she was a woman and awarding her $7.85 million in damages.</p><p>The verdict, which includes an award of $7 million in punitive damages, marks the first time the league has lost a discrimination case in court, said one of its lawyers, Jeffrey A. Mishkin. Mishkin, who is the league's executive vice president and chief legal officer, said the league would seek to have the decision set aside. The league could ask Judge Sidney H. Stein, who presided, to vacate the verdict, or could file an appeal.</p><p>Ortiz-Del Valle, 46, who teaches physical education and coaches basketball at Humanities High School on West 18th Street in Manhattan, sobbed as the verdict was announced. ''The best ref is what I wanted to be,'' she said afterward. ''I didn't go into it just because I wanted to break the doors down.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>During the six-day trial, the league's lawyers strongly disputed the discrimination allegations, and called as witnesses Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner, who made history this season when they became the first women to officiate regular-season games in the N.B.A. or any other major professional team sport. Palmer and Kantner both testified that they had been hired on merit and that they did not believe the league discriminated in hiring.</p><p>Mishkin called the verdict ''a bizarre sort of result.''</p><p>''Here is a finding that the N.B.A. discriminates against women in the hiring of officials, and we are the only league that has them,'' he said.</p><p>Ortiz-Del Valle's lawyers introduced documents that showed that the N.B.A. had given her high marks as a referee. One such document, a scouting report to Darell Garretson, the chief of the league's officiating staff, from Aaron C. Wade, another league official, described Ortiz-Del Valle as being in good physical condition, having ''excellent basketball officiating skills'' and being ''very knowledgeable about rules.'' Wade continued: ''I would not hesitate to recommend that at sometime in the near future she be considered to enter our training program.''</p><p>Her lawyers asserted that the league gave her varying reasons for denying her a job, which they called a pretext for discrimination.</p><p>''The N.B.A. has no formal admission process for potential referees,'' said one of her lawyers, Patricia M. Flannery, ''which means, if the man at the top wants to discriminate against women, it's very easy.''</p><p>The league maintained that Ortiz-Del Valle was treated no differently than male candidates and that she was not hired because she failed to upgrade the level of competition in her officiating schedule despite being asked to and that she was out of shape after 1993.</p><p>Ortiz Del-Valle, who now lives in Hillside, N.J., was born in Harlem, graduated from Bronx High School of Science and City College of New York, where she played forward and center on the women's team.</p><p>She said that she had all the qualifications to be an N.B.A. referee, including officiating in top men's amateur and professional basketball leagues for 17 years. In fact, in 1991 she worked a United States Basketball League game and became the first woman in history to officiate a men's professional basketball game. The uniform and whistle she used in the game are on exhibit at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.</p><p>She said she also officiated in men's leagues on the Jersey Shore, in Westchester County and in the New York Pro-Am league.</p><p>But N.B.A. officials kept setting up new obstacles to hiring her, she said.  She filed a complaint with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1995 and sued the league the next year.</p><p>''I got tired doing everything they asked, and realized that other people I had trained with were getting a start,'' Ortiz Dell-Valle said, adding that men she had officiated with were hired by the league.</p><p>''It was like they kept moving the basket.''</p><p>Photo: Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle after winning a lawsuit against the N.B.A. (Chang W.
