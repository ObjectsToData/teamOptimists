    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Universities and colleges come in every size and shape, but in all of them the arts play some role. That role can be curricular or extracurricular. It can be to train professional artists or to try to cultivate an appreciation for the arts among the student body. It can involve teaching by tenured faculty or by famous artists with a greater or looser connection to the institution. It can entail visiting performances and a more or less active curatorial program by the university's museum. And it can take place in a bucolic rural setting or in the middle of a bustling, highly cultured city.    Lee C. Bollinger, the new president of Columbia University, has long been known for his advocacy of the arts as integral to the university experience. He is also a hands-on reformer, as shown by his determination somehow to reshape the craft-oriented Columbia School of Journalism.  ">

Bollinger, the new president of Columbia University, has long been known for his advocacy of the arts as integral to the university experience. He is also a hands-on reformer, as shown by his determination somehow to reshape the craft-oriented Columbia School of Journalism.</p><p>Mr. Bollinger comes to New York City after five years as president of the University of Michigan. Ann Arbor may not be entirely bucolic, but it is not New York. So Mr. Bollinger finds himself running a major Ivy League research university in the most highly cultured city in the United States. He gives every sign of relishing the prospect of forging more ambitious, more glamorous bonds between the arts and the university.</p><p>''I can't imagine a great university without a school of the arts,'' he said in his Lowe Library office, thus effectively depriving Harvard, which lacks such a school, of great-university status. Mr. Bollinger was widely known to have been the runner-up to Lawrence H. Summers in Harvard's search for a new president.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''If you believe, as I do, that the arts are a fundamental means of thought and communication,'' he went on, ''why wouldn't you easily conclude that they must be part of the university community? If I had to choose between an expository form of expression and an intuitive form of expression, I would choose the latter to be more profound. I think it's a false premise that the arts are an add-on to ordinary life.''</p><p>Mr. Bollinger's plans -- some about to be announced, others more vaguely under discussion -- involve a new building, expansion and upgrading of the School of the Arts and the related undergraduate department of the arts; key appointments of well-known artists (like Mikhail Baryshnikov and stars from the theater and architecture); an aggressive expansion of collaborations with New York arts institutions; high-profile visits of national and international performance groups; and the widespread integration of such visitors into university life and community outreach.</p><p>''I couldn't do this in Michigan,'' he added. ''What we can do here in New York City is fantastic.''</p><p>An early (and to hear him tell it, still vestigial) example of such visits is the series of 12 performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company of an adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel about the birth of modern India, ''Midnight's Children.''</p><p>The performances begin tomorrow and continue to March 30 at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, near the university but until now separated from it by geography (Morningside Heights vs. the flatlands) and cultural differences.</p><p>Mr. Bollinger sits on the Royal Shakespeare Company board and sponsored its extensive visits to the University of Michigan. The ''Midnight's Children'' production was produced by Columbia with the company, the University of Michigan and its University Musical Society.</p><p>The performances come at the end of a monthlong Midnight Children's Humanities Festival, which includes public dialogues, open rehearsals, readings and debates. Several courses in different departments have been devoted to the play and the issues it raises. A performance will be held for Harlem schoolchildren.</p><p>But Mr. Bollinger would like to go beyond that. He imagines Columbia as a ''potential partner'' with major New York performing institutions and museums, all devoted to the exploration of themes like the Spanish Golden Age or Elizabethan London or Vienna at the turn of the last century. '' 'Midnight's Children' is an experiment in this kind of effort,'' he said. ''I think that the usual cultural experience is far too limited.''</p><p>In the longer term he hopes to initiate a ''very major campaign'' for a new building for the School of the Arts -- currently in the inadequate Dodge Hall -- and to expand its faculty and programs, all under the continuing leadership of its dean, Bruce W. Ferguson. The new building would be part of a larger ''campus planning process'' that Mr. Bollinger has initiated.</p><p>Mr. Bollinger said Columbia might expand on the south side of 125th Street near the Hudson River, where it owns property, and possibly to the north. He is especially interested in developing dance and theater programs within the School of the Arts; currently, he said, the affiliated Barnard College for women handles most of those, and would continue to do so, but he wants to refocus attention on those disciplines within the School of the Arts as well.</p><p>Mr. Bollinger said his vision for the arts at Columbia was based on his perception of how the arts related to academic life in two models, the liberal arts college and the large research university. (Although there are also hybrid models -- such as Harvard's, which may lack a school of the arts but has a growing, university-supported range of student extracurricular arts activities -- which may flourish in part, some argue, by the very absence of an intimidating faculty presence.)</p>                </div>
