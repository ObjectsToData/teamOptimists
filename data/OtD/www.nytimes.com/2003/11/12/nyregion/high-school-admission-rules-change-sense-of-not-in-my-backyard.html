But both programs are open only to students from Queens.</p><p>Beacon High School in Manhattan is similarly in demand, but applicants who live outside District 3 on the West Side have a slim chance of getting in. Millennium High School in Lower Manhattan favors applicants who live south of Houston Street.</p><p>Although Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein has imposed a new computerized matching system intended to give students the best shot at the high school they most want, a hodgepodge of old geographic preferences and other admissions criteria remains in effect at schools citywide.</p><p>So while Mr. Klein says the new matching process should reduce strategizing among applicants, parents say they and their children are still forced to think and rethink before ranking choices on high school applications, which for many students are due on Friday.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''The guidance counselor said she thought there was a shot of getting into a couple of the District 2 schools from District 3,'' said Bijou Miller, who lives on the Upper West Side and whose daughter, Sara, is applying to high school. ''Upper Lab, I know there is not. They just hate out-of-district.''</p><p>Upper Lab, short for the Lab School for Collaborative Studies, offers most of its high school seats to students moving on from the Lab Middle School, then gives preference for its remaining seats to children from District 2, which covers the Upper East Side and much of downtown Manhattan.</p><p>Ms. Miller said she was perplexed by how some schools favored specific neighborhoods and others particular districts, how some were open only to certain boroughs and how still others were open to students citywide.</p><p>''There was all this brouhaha about how Eleanor Roosevelt was the Upper East Side School,'' she said, referring to criticism that led to the new Eleanor Roosevelt High School on East 76th Street being open to all students in District 2, rather than just those from the immediate neighborhood. ''But if you look at Millennium,'' Ms. Miller said, ''it says preference to TriBeCa kids. I am wondering how they got away with that.''</p><p>The Department of Education said it would review admissions rules as part of a wider effort to overhaul high schools.</p><p>''We are reviewing the current system that was inherited by the department,'' said Jerry Russo, Mr. Klein's press secretary.</p><p>He said officials were confident that the new matching process, modeled on the system used to match medical school graduates with hospital residency programs, would help more students get one of their top-choice schools.</p><p>Under the new system, a student can apply to up to 12 schools -- apart from the specialized high schools that use an entrance exam -- but is assigned to just one school.</p><p>Parents, principals and guidance counselors who have been struggling to navigate the new admissions system say it, too, has all sorts of quirks -- some of which city education officials have been reluctant to acknowledge.</p><p>Among the quirks: students whose top choice is a school like Beacon or Millennium could actually have increased their chances for admission to those schools by not taking the exam for specialized schools like Stuyvesant.</p><p>The reason is that students who are accepted for one of the six specialized schools are included only in a first round of admissions to the other schools, and in it must compete with all the top students who are accepted to specialized schools.</p><p>Students who did not take the exam -- or who took the test but whose results are too low for them to be admitted to a specialized school -- are included in a second round of admissions, in which they face diminished competition for the remaining seats in nonexam schools.</p><p>City officials insist that students accepted at the specialized schools are only ''slightly'' disadvantaged, and say that of 3,200 students admitted to specialized high schools last year, only 400 chose not to attend.</p><p>But perhaps the oddest aspect of the city's high school admissions process is not new: an admissions formula for dozens of schools with ''educational option'' programs -- 16 percent above grade level, 68 percent on grade level and 16 percent below grade level.</p><p>The formula, instituted in the 1980's, was intended to increase minority enrollment in special programs focusing on particular subjects like law, science, math, engineering and the humanities.</p><p>The formula focused on student performance, which historically has been poorer among black and Hispanic children compared with whites and Asians. But this so-called achievement gap has been narrowing in recent years. In addition, the city's public school student body is now more than 70 percent black and Hispanic.</p><p>The formula entails other curiosities. Students who score in the top 2 percent on the eighth-grade reading test are guaranteed a seat at educational option schools, often filling up the spaces allotted for students achieving above their grade level.</p><p>And as a further hedge against corruption, officials at the individual schools select half the children for educational option programs and the other half is chosen at random by computers.</p><p>At other schools that base admission on auditions or art portfolios or at schools with so-called ''screened'' programs that use factors like grades, test scores and attendance, school officials typically make all the decisions.</p><p>Another change for this year is that students must now apply if they want to attend their neighborhood school. ''It's a little mind-boggling to us,'' said Rick Hallman, the principal of Cardozo, which is one of the city's top neighborhood schools. ''But regardless of whether you live across the street from the school,'' he said, ''you have to put it on the list.''</p>                </div>
