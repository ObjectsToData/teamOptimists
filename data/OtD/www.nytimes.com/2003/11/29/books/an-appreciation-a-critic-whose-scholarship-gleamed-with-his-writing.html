    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Hugh Kenner, who died at 80 at his home in Athens, Ga., this week, was among the finest writers of critical prose in America. He was one of the few commentators whose books and articles cause delight and stand as literary achievements in their own right, including ''Gnomon: Essays in Contemporary Literature'' (1958); ''Dublin's Joyce'' (1955); ''The Stoic Comedians: Flaubert, Joyce and Beckett'' (1964); ''The Counterfeiters: An Historical Comedy'' (1968), the latter two illustrated by the writer and artist Guy Davenport; ''The Pound Era'' (1971).     His 25 books are charmingly written, intellectually alive excursions. They have a scientist's eye for elegance, clarity and specificity.  ">

                    <p>Hugh Kenner, who died at 80 at his home in Athens, Ga., this week, was among the finest writers of critical prose in America. He was one of the few commentators whose books and articles cause delight and stand as literary achievements in their own right, including ''Gnomon: Essays in Contemporary Literature'' (1958); ''Dublin's Joyce'' (1955); ''The Stoic Comedians: Flaubert, Joyce and Beckett'' (1964); ''The Counterfeiters: An Historical Comedy'' (1968), the latter two illustrated by the writer and artist Guy Davenport; ''The Pound Era'' (1971).</p><p>His 25 books are charmingly written, intellectually alive excursions. They have a scientist's eye for elegance, clarity and specificity.</p><p>Kenner studied mathematics early on in his native Canada, and with informed enthusiasm for the machine age, in 1984 developed a computer program, Travesty, that scrambles literary texts, highlighting idioms and structures within. In another book, ''Geodesic Math and How to Use It'' (1976, recently reissued by the University of California Press) Kenner explicated the domes invented by the ecological designer Buckminster Fuller more lucidly than Fuller did himself.</p><p>For Kenner, computers furnished a partial solution for the hearing loss that afflicted him from early childhood, along with a thickened and often difficult to understand speech. The possibilities of written communication online, bypassing the need for hearing or speaking words, thrilled Kenner, who told a college computing symposium at St. Olaf College in Minnesota in 1983 that computers were destined to affect education in a way comparable to ''the invention of the alphabet that made writing possible.''</p>                </div>

                    <p>The development of educational software in the subsequent 20 years has proved his point. In the mid-1980's Kenner assembled his own pioneering Heath/Zenith Z-100 computer and wrote a guide to the machine. Kenner related his own satisfaction in technological advances to favorite writers like Samuel Beckett in his incisive ''The Mechanic Muse'' (1987), in which Beckett's style is praised as a ''proto-computer-language.''</p><p>Kenner was equally innovative in the more traditional area of showing how literature responds to eternal human concerns. In 1948 he followed the advice of his mentor at the University of Toronto, Marshall McLuhan, to visit Ezra Pound, then detained at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington.</p><p>Whereas McLuhan dismissed Pound as a ''crank,'' Kenner became friendly with the poet, who advised him to visit the ''great men'' of his time. He did, and Kenner's warmth and humor turned his meetings with T. S. Eliot, Beckett and Wyndham Lewis into significant and revealing stories about these writers.</p><p>Dry humor and tolerance of human foibles were features of Kenner's approach. ''Chuck Jones: A Flurry of Drawings'' (University of California Press, 1994), a witty homage to the creator of Wile E. Coyote and Michigan J. Frog, analyzed the technique of animated cartoons, and what made Jones particularly funny.</p><p>A visit to Kenner could have its own unexpected comic results. At Johns Hopkins, Kenner decorated the English department office during his chairmanship with schizophrenic images drawn by Zelda Fitzgerald, the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife, during one of her psychiatric hospitalizations.</p><p>Pointing out to one visitor in the early 1980's a particularly violent image in electric silver tones, Kenner opined, ''This one looks to me like the perfect androgynous image.'' The departmental secretaries looked up from their desks with resigned smiles.</p><p>Blessed with sympathy for the offbeat, Kenner seemed to prefer writers who were exiles or marginals. ''The Elsewhere Community,'' first delivered as the 1997 Massey Lectures at the University of Toronto, spoke of authors finding stimulation from groups encountered ''elsewhere,'' whether in Europe or on the Internet today.</p><p>A friend and fellow critic, Marjorie Perloff of Stanford University, points out in ''The Outsider as Exemplary Critic: Hugh Kenner,'' published in The William Carlos Williams Review, that like the exiled or marginal writers Kenner favored, ''Kenner himself, in one sense the most celebrated of American critics, has been -- and continues to be -- marginalized by the Anglo-American academic establishment.''</p><p>The study of theory, led by mostly unreadable eminences, has overtaken the academic world, at several removes from Kenner's enjoyable approach.</p><p>Yet Kenner had no intention of letting this spoil his (or his readers') fun.</p><p>Intelligent as he indubitably was, Kenner was no highbrow purist. As he wrote in ''The Elsewhere Community'': ''The dividing line between high and low culture is utterly fictitious. Genuine culture is neither high nor low; it involves ideas you're happy to keep returning to for the rest of your life.''</p><p>The same may be said of Hugh Kenner's books, which look likely to remain permanent signposts of delight for readers in generations to come. Some surprises may still be in store.</p><p>The archive of Kenner's papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a number of intriguing unpublished projects by Kenner, including ''Zukofsky's Eye,'' a study of the modernist poet, a meditation on rhyme and an anthology of English literature.</p><p>Photo: Hugh Kenner, shown circa 1990, was the author of 25 books.
