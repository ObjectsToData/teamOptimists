    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="David Douglas Duncan is the first to admit he is lucky: certainly lucky to have emerged unscathed from combat photography in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and several smaller conflicts; lucky to have become a friend of one of the 20th century's most famous artists, Pablo Picasso, about whom he published six coffee-table books; lucky to be in good health as his 88th birthday approaches in January.    ''I assign luck to God or whatever you want to call it,'' he said softly. ''But I have often wondered about it. I've been the oldest guy there, and the youngest guy has been killed right next to me. How can this be? This young innocent kid is killed, and I'm still standing here with all my failings. It's irrational.''  ">

                    <p>David Douglas Duncan is the first to admit he is lucky: certainly lucky to have emerged unscathed from combat photography in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and several smaller conflicts; lucky to have become a friend of one of the 20th century's most famous artists, Pablo Picasso, about whom he published six coffee-table books; lucky to be in good health as his 88th birthday approaches in January.</p><p>''I assign luck to God or whatever you want to call it,'' he said softly. ''But I have often wondered about it. I've been the oldest guy there, and the youngest guy has been killed right next to me. How can this be? This young innocent kid is killed, and I'm still standing here with all my failings. It's irrational.''</p><p>Yet Mr. Duncan has not waited for luck. Since he was in his late teens he has always responded to opportunity with spontaneity. And it is this emotional openness -- to adventure, beauty, friendship, tragedy -- that has perhaps most defined his work and life. ''I'm an embarrassment to Sheila,'' he said of his wife, who is also an artist. ''I'm giving a slide show on Korea or Vietnam, and, bang, it hits me. Tears roll down my face.''</p><p>With the publication in November of his autobiography, ''Photo Nomad'' (W. W. Norton), Mr. Duncan has again united the emotional and the visual. To chronicle his voyage through what he calls ''my century,'' he not only presents some 400 photographs from the tens of thousands he has taken, but also tells his own story in captions, notes and anecdotes that echo his passion and humor.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The result is not another coffee-table book, but a 464-page volume the size of a hardcover novel. ''I felt it might have a chance of being read -- on planes, in bed, anyplace -- if it could be hand held,'' he explained at his hillside home here, 15 miles north of Cannes, where he has lived since 1962. Because this format was not favored by his usual publishers, Mr. Duncan designed, wrote, edited and even paid for the printing of the book himself, selling the North American rights to Norton. ''It has taken 15 years,'' he said. Other projects also kept him busy. In 2000 he published ''Faceless,'' a book of portraits of Henri Cartier-Bresson, which earned him the wrath of that French photographer. In 1999 he published the story of Yo-Yo, his Norwich terrier puppy who was kidnapped and ransomed by a Marseille gang. In 1996, he tapped his archives for ''Picasso Paints a Portrait.''</p><p>Yet it is for his work as a Life magazine war photographer in the 1950's and 60's that Mr. Duncan is best remembered in the United States. His images of death and destruction and his poignant portraits of mud-splattered young American soldiers in Korea and Vietnam conveyed the horror of war to those back home.</p><p>His work in Korea was described by the American photographer Edward Steichen as ''the highest tide that combat photography has achieved.''</p><p>For Mr. Duncan, however, Korea and Vietnam were very different conflicts. In the case of Korea, he noted, the North attacked the South, which needed to be defended. But Mr. Duncan was openly critical of the war in Vietnam. His powerful photographs of the siege of Khe Sanh in early 1968 appeared in Life, but he wanted to say more.</p><p>Back in the United States, he published ''I Protest!'' a paperback that included 122 images along with text denouncing not only the American tactics but also the entire rationale of the conflict. He charged $1 for the book and sold 250,000 copies.</p><p>''I don't think you can impose a social order from the top down,'' he said. ''That's what I was saying: 'These guys are being killed away from home for an issue that doesn't involve us. It's not an American issue. It's a Vietnamese issue.' ''You could just change the date, change it to Iraq today. I think we're a bunch of preachers. We try to impose our will on people all over the world.''</p><p>Mr. Duncan is still proud that he spoke out against the Vietnam War, perhaps even more proud than he is of his images of the conflict.</p><p>''War is the easiest photography in the business,'' he said. ''Just get close, be lucky, know how your camera works. There are subjects everywhere. Everyplace you go there is something to photograph in a war, like being in the middle of a hurricane or a train crash or an earthquake. You can't miss it.''</p><p>''I felt no sense of mission as a combat photographer,'' he went on. ''I just felt maybe the guys out there deserved being photographed just the way they are, whether they are running scared, or showing courage, or diving into a hole, or talking and laughing. And I think I did bring a sense of dignity to the battlefield. My only rule: I never photographed the face of the dead, ever, out of respect for the families.''</p><p>Yet the images in ''Photo Nomad'' -- from the treasures of the Kremlin to the sunflowers of Provence -- confirm that war has been only a small part of his life.</p><p>Born on Jan. 23, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Duncan began learning the trade with a 39-cent camera given to him on his 18th birthday. In 1937 a photograph of a Mexican fisherman won him second place in an Eastman Kodak competition. With the $250 prize, he finally bought a real camera.</p><p>Unable to find work after graduating with a degree in zoology from the University of Miami, he turned to his hobby.</p>                </div>
