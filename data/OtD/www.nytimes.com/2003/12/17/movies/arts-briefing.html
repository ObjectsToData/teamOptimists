R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novels, as the best film of 2003. ''Mystic River,'' ''American Splendor'' and ''Lost in Translation'' were other contenders for the honor. Sofia Coppola was chosen best director for ''Lost in Translation,'' about the friendship of an aging actor and a young wife at a hotel in Tokyo. Bill Murray, top left, a star of that film, was named best actor. The best actress honor went to Hope Davis, left, for portrayals in two films: as the bookish wife of a comic book writer in ''American Splendor,'' and as a dentist and part-time opera singer having an affair in ''The Secret Lives of Dentists.'' Supporting-actor accolades went to Shohreh Aghdashloo for her portrayal of an Iranian immigrant in ''House of Sand and Fog,'' and Eugene Levy for his performance as a folk singer in ''A Mighty Wind.'' In other awards, ''City of God,'' about gang wars in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, was named best foreign-language film; ''Capturing the Friedmans,'' a documentary about charges of child molestation against one family, was chosen best nonfiction film; and ''The Triplets of Belleville,'' from France, was named best animated feature. The 69th annual awards by the 35-member group will be presented on Jan. 11.">

The 69th annual awards by the 35-member group will be presented on Jan. 11.</p><p>BAM'S SPRING SEASON -- Dance from troupes like the Netherlands Dance Theater and the Lyon Opera Ballet, opera by Handel from the Venice Baroque Orchestra, two Shakespeare productions, Tony Kushner's ''Homebody/Kabul'' and the return of the Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise are among the 11 attractions of the spring season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The lineup ''reflects artistic and cultural diversity and inspired innovation,'' said Joseph V. Melillo, executive producer of the academy. Besides dance and theater, the season includes related film, education and humanities events, as well as music, like the performance by Beverly Crawford, the New Life Tabernacle Mass Choir and the Total Praise of Emmanuel Baptist Church, which begins the schedule on Jan. 17. That program, ''Praise Music,'' continues the academy's exploration of musical art forms that have shaped modern popular music. The Shakespeare productions include ''Pericles,'' from the Theater for a New Audience in its academy debut, and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' in the United States debut of the all-male British company Propeller. The Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise will present Moli&egrave;re's ''Imaginary Invalid,'' and the Venice Baroque Orchestra will present what is described as the first fully staged United States production of Handel's ''Siroe.'' The season, closing with a world premiere and a New York premiere from the Mark Morris Dance Group, continues through June 13.</p><p>BRITAIN: OZZY UPDATE -- Six months will be needed for the rock star Ozzy Osbourne to recover from injuries suffered during an all-terrain-vehicle accident last week on his estate in England, according to his wife, Sharon. ''He will be back; he's not going anywhere. He'll be ordering everyone around, don't worry,'' she said in a television interview reported by the BBC. ''He's busy telling jokes all the time. He's already asked two nurses to marry him.'' Doctors plan to fit a seven-inch steel plate to the back of Mr. Osbourne's neck as a support to counter a cracked vertebra. While he was hospitalized, she said, he cried when he learned that ''Changes,'' a duet with his daughter, Kelly, had reached the top of the British charts. The BBC said he had set a record by taking 33 years to reach the pinnacle. ''Paranoid,'' his first hit with Black Sabbath, climbed as high as No. 4 in 1970.</p>                </div>

                    <p>WASHINGTON: ARTS GRANTS -- The National Endowment for the Arts is announcing 915 grants totaling more than $25.3 million today in its first major awards of the 2004 fiscal year. The endowment's budget for the year is $122.5 million. Its grants to nonprofit national, regional, state and local organizations finance projects in the categories of creativity, services to arts organizations and artists, literature fellowships and leadership initiatives. Dana Gioia, chairman of the endowment, said, ''From enlivening and diversifying our literary culture through university and independent presses to placing artists in residencies at high-technology corporations to producing new operas, plays and ballets, these projects enhance the artistic quality and availability of the arts across the country.''</p><p>SPAIN: ''CARMEN'' IN SEVILLE -- The Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura, whose credits include ''Blood Wedding'' (1981) and ''Flamenco'' (1997), is to direct 10 performances of Bizet's ''Carmen,'' to be presented in September in Seville, the heroine's hometown in Spain. The $15.8 million production, previously announced, is to be conducted by Lorin Maazel, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, the BBC reported. Produced by Michael Ecker with the international music festival in Seville, this ''Carmen'' calls upon the audience to follow the tale of tragic love as it plays out around city landmarks, including the original cigar factory and the bullring.</p><p>FOOTNOTES</p><p>Beethoven's 233rd birthday will be celebrated at 7:30 tonight with a free concert of three string quartets performed by the Shanghai Quartet at the City University of New York Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street. Presented by Great Music for a Great City, this concert is the third in a six-part series by the ensemble, traversing Beethoven's entire string quartet cycle.</p><p>Photos: Maggie Gyllenhaal, in Tony Kushner's ''Homebody/Kabul,'' will again appear in that play, this time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has announced its spring lineup.
