                    <p>Meg Campbell has banned French fries and fast food from Codman Academy, the small charter high school she opened here three years ago. Her students, who are overwhelmingly poor and black, eat fresh fruit and veggie burgers. With Ms. Campbell pushing them, they walk up to 10 miles a week and play tennis.</p><p>Back in middle school, in classes of 30, most of the students were reading well below grade level, and many were getting D's and F's. Now, in classes of 15, they are taking on Shakespeare, James Joyce and Chinua Achebe.</p><p>Codman is a model of the small school that is the new blueprint for urban high schools. One measure of its success is this: Last year, all 25 sophomores passed the language arts portion of Massachusetts's high-stakes exam. Two blocks away, at Dorchester High, whose 930 students are also overwhelmingly poor and minority, the passing rate was 53 percent.</p><p>One of Codman's most important advantages is Ms. Campbell, a poet and community organizer who runs the school. Having raised two daughters, one a graduate of Wellesley, the other of Barnard, Ms. Campbell, 51, a Radcliffe graduate, brings to her relationships with her students the qualities of a pushy, upper-middle-class mother who doesn't want her children to miss any opportunity for intellectual growth -- or to eat junk food.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''Middle- and upper-middle-class kids are in a river that carries them along to college,'' she said. ''We're trying to create a river for these kids.''</p><p>The tennis, which is required at Codman, is just one part of Ms. Campbell's strategy for getting her students into top colleges and on track to upward mobility. ''Whoever heard of black inner-city kids playing tennis,'' she said, envisioning their college applications.</p><p>Tyshawnna Richardson, a junior, complains often to her grandmother, Gwen Richardson, who is raising her: ''Meg is always on my back.'' Gwen Richardson said: ''I tell her, 'The reason she's on your back is that she knows what you can do. She can see things in yourself you don't see.' ''</p><p>Tyshawnna and most of the other juniors were hardly thinking about college when they entered Codman two years ago.</p><p>''I didn't care whether I could read or write or spell,'' said Jonalis Carrasquillo, 17, who has since declared her intention to go to Emerson College and become an actress.</p><p>Jonalis's humanities teacher, Thabiti Brown, 27, a graduate of Brown and Columbia, gave her one-on-one coaching and made her care about reading. ''How am I going to be an actress if I can't read the script,'' she said. She is still reveling in her triumph: passing the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System exam. .</p><p>Codman, with 83 students, six teachers, four teaching fellows and two administrators, is small enough that it can pay plenty of attention not only to academics but to the students' physical, emotional and family lives as well. The families are considered part of the school. At the initial school interview, the parents are asked: ''What is your dream for your child?'' Ms. Campbell and the teachers give the students their cellphone numbers and are always available for extra help or just to talk.</p><p>Kim Parker, 28, the sophomore humanities teacher, calls each of her 24 students and their parents every Sunday, ''just to check in.''</p><p>Tony Welsh, a sophomore, wrote in a letter of advice to the incoming ninth graders last year: ''The teachers here care about you. I don't know why, but they do.''</p><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given $14 million to the Boston public schools for small high schools (Dorchester High was broken into three small schools this fall) and $51.2 million for the creation of 67 small high schools in New York City.</p><p>One of the models for the new schools in New York is Codman Academy. Eleven years ago, Ms. Campbell helped start Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound, which applies Outward Bound's principles -- learning by doing, teamwork, service and character development -- to schools. She has structured Codman around these principles.</p><p>Codman Academy is not a recipient of the Gates money, and it meets its $825,000 annual budget primarily with state education funds and private donations.</p><p>Ms. Campbell opened her school in the Codman Square Health Center, in the Dorchester neighborhood where she lives, so her students could get the medical and dental care and counseling that she believes are as important to their success as Codman's young, idealistic and academically demanding teachers. The teachers, who are mostly black and Hispanic, are all graduates of top colleges.</p><p>To Ms. Campbell, it is not coincidental that the juniors began performing better in school as they began eating healthy food, getting regular exercise and, for those who needed to, losing weight. She sees a clear link between the twin epidemics of obesity and academic failure among poor minority children.</p><p>''If you don't feel good about yourself, how can you achieve at a high level,'' she said.</p><p>A newly fit Jonalis agrees. ''I was pushing 200 pounds,'' she said. ''I've lost 50 pounds. My doctor asked me, 'How are you losing weight?' I said, 'If you went to Codman Academy, and you walked everywhere, you'd lose weight, too. Plus, Meg is always handing out apples and bananas. I'm saying, 'Let me eat this banana instead of chips.' ''</p><p>School is in session from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week and 9 to noon on Saturdays. No credit is earned for grades below a C-. Tony Welsh wrote in his letter to the ninth-graders: ''This place is no joke. If you're one of those people who doesn't do any work, I advise you to change your ways. These teachers will hound you and ride your back until whatever you need to turn in to pass is turned in.''</p><p>The words of Shakespeare and other playwrights come alive for Codman's students when they see the plays performed -- and meet the actors and directors --at the Huntington Theatre, with which the school has a partnership. The students also go regularly to the Museum of Fine Arts. The juniors study physics at Simmons College.</p><p>Codman is a college preparatory school, and once a month the students spend a day on a campus: Amherst, Dartmouth, Boston College. Lest a moment of the day be wasted, Codman's bathrooms are stocked with college catalogs and Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.</p><p>''Dwell in possibility,'' Ms. Campbell tells her students, quoting her favorite Emily Dickinson poem.</p><p>The other afternoon she listened as Socrates Cribb, a 17-year-old sophomore who made the honor roll this semester and is blossoming as a writer, dreamed out loud about his own possibilities: going to Harvard, and becoming ''a great writer.''</p><p>His father, Andre, a Haitian immigrant, works in the kitchen at Harvard, and Socrates talked about the time he visited him on the job. He had hoped to visit some classrooms, Socrates said, ''but the security guard wouldn't let me out of the kitchen.''</p><p>Ms. Campbell saw Socrates's sad story as one more opportunity. ''Think of your college essay,'' she said. Socrates' serious, dark eyes flashed.</p><p>''That school,'' he said later, ''it changed my whole view of life.''</p><p>Photos: Socrates Cribb, 17, son of a Haitian immigrant, is on the honor roll in 10th grade. He wrote to new students: ''If you're one of those people who doesn't do any work, I advise you to change your ways.''; Meg Campbell opened Codman Academy in Boston three years ago, demanding excellence of students who had done poorly in the past. Last year all 25 sophomores passed a high-stakes state exam. (Photographs by Jodi Hilton for The New York Times)  </p>                </div>
