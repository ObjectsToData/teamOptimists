                    <p>Mr. Schwartz said his father, a Polish immigrant, ''had no idea what went on in the classroom because he had never sat in one all his life. So for him to allow me to go to school was an intuitive sense that this was probably a very good thing for me.''</p><p>The authors gathered in an wood-paneled room in Shepard Hall, a majestic Gothic building where many had taken classes. Besides the 50-year gap in ages, the most obvious difference was between the race and ethnicity of the former students and those of the current ones.</p><p>In 1953, the student body was mostly white and Jewish. Today's students are a polyglot mixture from around the globe, including Asia, Europe, Africa and North and South America.</p><p>At first, the students clustered on one side and the alumni on the other, but gradually they began to mix. And as James F. Watts, dean of humanities and the arts, read aloud from the essays, the common ground became apparent: the impoverished backgrounds, the determination to succeed, the conviction that a college education was crucial.</p><p>''They're striving for the same things we were striving for,'' said Thelma Zucker Goldstein, a 1953 graduate who taught in a public school in the Bronx and in the Army. ''I commend them and I support them.''</p><p>Most of the class of '53 students were the first in their families to attend college, and the free tuition at City College was a major attraction.</p><p>''I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't gotten in,'' Herbert Aschkenasy, an Oregon businessman who wrote an essay but did not attend the reception, said in a telephone interview. ''I'm not sure what my backup choice was.''</p><p>The class of '53 does not include alumni with the fame of a Colin Powell or Jonas Salk -- City College alumni from other years -- but its members did well. They became doctors and lawyers, engineers and teachers. Sol Gothard is a judge in the Louisiana State Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal and a professor at Tulane University. Mr. Schwartz established a fur company and won local renown as Fred the Furrier.</p><p>The new graduates have not had as much time to prove themselves yet, but their aims are high. Assia Nakova, who has received a full scholarship for a doctoral program in history at Princeton, wrote of her desire to follow in the footsteps of successful City College alumni like Upton Sinclair. Keyri Soto wants to make films that will change the way people think. Maryellen V. Benito plans to earn both a medical degree and a Ph.D., and hopes to ''discover a novel idea that will make a difference in the world and have a very successful research and clinical lab.''</p><p>For many of the 50-year alumni, as well as for today's graduating seniors, money -- or the lack of it -- was the primary motivation behind attending City. (Tuition is now $3,200 a year.)</p><p>In his essay, Arthur Freed, an engineer, told of ''carrying a stick with a nail on the end, picking up debris along the Westchester County parkways'' to earn money for books and lab fees. Most of today's students also work while in college, although many have been able to do so in science labs or other jobs connected to their studies.</p><p>While the 50-year alumni clearly admired the students they met, they remained divided over the impact of open admissions, which began in 1970. Some, like Felix P. Berman, a painter's son from the Bronx who taught in New York City public schools and was a principal and a deputy superintendent, saw the admission of students with poor academic preparation as a blow to the college's stature.</p><p>''I understand that they were trying to provide access to poor people,'' he said. ''But they shouldn't have lowered standards. It did a lot of damage to the reputation of the university. But now they have revitalized the standards and they have really turned the university around.''</p><p>But others in his class saw open admissions as evidence that the college was carrying out its historic mission.</p><p>''I feel as though the college was meeting the needs of the community, just as it was in 1847, when it was founded,'' said Dolores Schwartz Hodesblatt, who went into public relations and fund-raising after graduation.</p><p>The graduating seniors assured their predecessors that the standards they had encountered were high and that their classmates were bright.</p><p>Ms. Nakova, the senior headed for Princeton, said City College had been challenging. ''It taught me to think independently,'' she said, adding that in Bulgaria, where she grew up, the focus was more on ''regurgitation.''</p><p>Some of the alumni wrote of the ways the college had groomed them. Mr. Berman, the painter's son, recalled how his speech teacher made him stand in front of a mirror reciting consonants and making sure the tip of his tongue touched the top of his teeth.</p><p>''This was to ensure that I would be removing the Bronx from my speech and replacing it with elegant mid-American English,'' Mr. Berman wrote.</p><p>He also recalled a dinner at which he asked about the proper way to eat chicken. ''Watch me,'' the college president's wife told him, lifting the chicken to her mouth with her hands.</p><p>Addressing the alumni and students, Gregory H. Williams, the college's president, returned to the issue of open access.</p><p>''We should never forget that the founding of this college faced fierce opposition,'' he said. ''There was opposition to the idea that you could take the poor, the children of immigrants, and do things with them.''</p><p>Photos: Felix P.
