The National Zoological Park is creating an area for endangered animals from Asia, and a children's farm, and the National Museum of American History is adding a huge transportation exhibition this year. The Smithsonian projects under way now total almost $1 billion in federal money. And in addition to the Smithsonian projects, the government is contributing $400 million to a $650 million renovation at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that includes a pedestrian plaza.</p><p>''This is a vote of confidence in the city,'' said Lawrence Small, the head of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Other major projects include the Corcoran Art Gallery's $150 million new wing and the Phillips Collection's $22 million expansion of exhibition space for its 2,400 paintings. The Newseum, the museum of news, is relocating and tripling its space with a $400 million building half a block from the Mall. Not far away, Washington's first City Museum, costing $30 million, has just opened, and at least three theaters, including the nationally known Arena Stage, plan to expand.</p><p>The considerable investment in the capital's cultural institutions comes as state budgets for the arts are withering across the country and wealthy patrons and foundations are generally retrenching.</p><p>Museums and other attractions nationwide are still suffering from a significant decline in visitors as the fear of terrorist attacks and less disposable income in a stagnant economy have tamped down tourist numbers. Even the Smithsonian, with its policy of free museum admission, suffers when numbers are down because it relies for some of its operating costs on money visitors spend at museum stores and restaurants; one-third of its 6,400-member staff, for example, are paid with this revenue, called business venture funds, and income is down this fiscal year.</p><p>Attendance had been rising at the Smithsonian's 16 museums and the zoo until September 2001, when visitor numbers plummeted. Just as the tourist trade began to revive last fall, it was set back again by the combination of sniper attacks, a harsh winter and terrorism alerts. The tally for 2002 was 24.4 million, down from 31.1 million in 2000, which was the last ''normal'' year. Although it is too early to predict totals for 2003, numbers at the most-visited Air and Space Museum have picked up sharply -- one million in April 2003, compared with 641,000 in the same month a year ago. But totals for two other museums on the Mall, the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History, are down significantly. So far, both have registered one-third fewer visits this year than in the same period in 2002.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the enormous amount of private and public money being spent on arts expansion in the city is surprising -- but not to local arts supporters.</p><p>''It's a coming of age,'' said Katherine Freshley, of the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, which helps finance arts and theater groups in the Washington area.</p><p>''What is whirling around began long ago in quite a few cases,'' she said, referring to the years of planning for efforts like the new City Museum. ''But it is coming together at the worst moment economically.''</p><p>Ellen Lovell, president of the Center for Arts and Culture, an independent group studying cultural issues, agreed that the ''city is coming into its own as a major cultural capital,'' but questioned the expansion's viability.</p><p>''The big question is: Can they all raise the money in a time of economic and philanthropic downturn?'' she said. ''And, if they succeed, are they prepared for the increases in operating funds and maintenance that new facilities generate?''</p><p>Several museum leaders said they were mindful of the risks, but were still moving ahead. David C. Levy, president and director of the Corcoran, said the museum had already raised slightly more than half the money required to break ground on its new Frank Gehry addition and was going ahead with what he called ''a very sexy project which is seen as being very important to architecture in this city.'' Construction is scheduled to start in 18 months if the money is sufficient by then.</p><p>He said that a change in the leadership of the capital campaign did more harm to the Corcoran's plans than any decline in the economy or philanthropy. ''Clearly the economy slowed down and people pulled in their horns,'' he said. ''Everyone started in a period of euphoria, and now we are in a period of caution.''</p><p>Washington's unique position as the home of major federal institutions has also helped stimulate the current expansion, said Robert Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, a nonprofit group. He said that in a typical community about 10 percent of arts money comes from government sources. But in Washington, the Smithsonian itself is 75 percent federally financed.</p><p>The District of Columbia's government has also encouraged expansion, said Dorothy McSweeney, chairwoman of the district's Commission on Arts and Humanities, by easing zoning laws and helping with bond issues and other financing.</p><p>Over the long term, however, government money for the arts in Washington has grown tighter, not more abundant. In 1989, Congress agreed to pay two-thirds of the American Indian museum's construction cost of $219 million, leaving museum officials to raise the rest privately. More than a decade later, in a tighter budgetary era, Congress is leaving more of the fund-raising to private groups and individuals. The new $309 million Air and Space Museum complex, for example, was built with private money (a first for the Smithsonian) and will support itself except for a limited number of federally paid staff salaries and some basic costs of running the building.</p><p>Still, money concerns have not dampened the amount of construction and renovation, which is unprecedented in the Smithsonian's 157-year history, even eclipsing the expansions of the late 1960's and early 70's. Mr. Small ascribed this to the city's unique niche.</p><p>''The difference between Washington and any other city,'' he said in an interview in his office at the Smithsonian's historic Castle building, ''is that Americans are making a pilgrimage to their capital, to the national repository of their historical and scientific heritage.''</p><p>Photos: Despite the economy, the Smithsonian is growing as never before, with its new American Indian museum, left, and Air and Space Museum addition.
