What they need. What we can do.</p><p>Sometimes the eyes tell us. When my father opened his eyes, three days after a massive cerebral hemorrhage, they weren't clear and hazel as usual, but wild and black. It was like looking into a storm at night, or a destroyed brain. My father wasn't there. We asked the hospital to disconnect his hydration and feeding tubes. As I've come to learn, a person can live for a month or more without food, but only 8 to 14 days without water. Nine days later, still in a coma, he died.</p><p>Sometimes the eyes deceive us. I saw the same wild black emptiness in my mother's eyes, 36 hours after the same kind of stroke. She was in a coma, too. Experience told me she was gone. We were about to disconnect her when she woke up, going, in minutes, from comatose to a critic of the hospital room d&eacute;cor.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''That picture really is dreadful,'' she said, pointing. ''I'd like it taken down.''</p><p>She was back. Then seven days later, she had another stroke, a clot. That was five and a half years ago. She can eat when fed, but now she says nothing, smiles less than Terri Schiavo and just looks at me with clear eyes.</p><p>The victims of strokes can be terrible puzzles, a torture to families, and sometimes an ordeal for the courts. Ms. Schiavo, 39, is not in a coma. Since her heart stopped in 1990, depriving her brain of oxygen, she has been in something slightly less severe, a persistent vegetative state.</p><p>''There may be facial expressions,'' said Michael A. Williams, a neurologist at the Johns Hopkins medical school. ''If something hurts, they may grimace. They may cry. And they look for all the world as if they are looking right at you.''</p><p>It is all involuntary, he said, and can occur even if the thinking, experiencing part of brain has been destroyed. ''It makes it much harder'' to accept that the patient is not responding, he said.</p><p>Michael Schiavo, who married Terri, has said that he used to hope for her recovery, but years ago accepted that his wife, whom he said once told him she would never want to be maintained in such a state, wasn't there anymore -- and should be allowed to die. But the Schindlers, who raised her, see the promise of recovery when they look at her. For five years, Mr. Schiavo, her court-appointed guardian, has sought to disconnect her tubes, fought every step of the way by his in-laws.</p><p>It is understandable. One person who loves her could wish to let her die. Another who loves her could desperately want to keep her alive. That is what the courts are for, and since the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan 25years ago, a body of law has developed consolidating the right to die. Mr. Schiavo finally won an order to have her tubes removed on Oct. 15. But by then, fired by the appeals of her parents, public prayer vigils, demonstrations and a global e-mail campaign, his wife's case had acquired the kind of political head of steam associated with fights over abortion.</p><p>Last Tuesday, after one day of debate, dramatized by videos of Terri Schiavo's smiles and open eyes, the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed a law allowing Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, to order her tubes returned. He did. She was about half-way to death when nourishment was restored.</p><p>The action is said to appeal to the Republicans' conservative Christian base. But the voters most affected by this issue are those most prone to stroke -- those over 65, and particularly over 75, a huge population in Florida. They're not all happy with their Legislature and governor, and some of them are consulting their children and lawyers.</p><p>''I think it's perfectly dreadful,'' said Lucile Foster, 78, who lives in an apartment at Canterbury Tower, a residence for the elderly in Tampa. ''I'm a born-again Christian. I know where I'm going when I die. And I have already called my oldest son and said I just want to be sure that you'll pull the plug on me if I get like that.''</p><p>Her son told her not to worry. She has a living will, and he knows how she feels. But when a friend of hers read about the Schiavo case and decided to check with her two daughters, one said, ''Mother, I would never pull the plug on you.''</p><p>''Don't worry, Mother,'' the other daughter said. ''I would.''</p><p>''She gave her power of attorney to that daughter,'' Mrs. Foster said.</p><p>When people are young, it is hard to take mortality seriously. At the Johns Hopkins medical school in a classroom filled with more than 80 students and faculty members last week, a speaker asked how many had living wills. Not one student raised a hand. But many of the faculty did. The Schiavo case may make them wonder if they can count on the established case law. It was the Nancy Beth Cruzan case in Missouri, in 1990, that began to establish the right of family or friends to speak for the wishes of those who hadn't signed living wills. At the medical school at the University of South Florida, Lois LaCivita Nixon an ethics and humanities professor, expects her first-year students, aged 22 and 23, to be the first medical school class in the country to sign living wills.</p><p>That is young, but Karen Ann Quinlan, whose case opened this subject, was only 21 when she fell into a coma. Nancy Beth Cruzan was 33 when she died. They were both, like Ms. Schiavo, in permanent vegetative states. Politicians, if not the courts, forget that we've been through this before, and that otherwise healthy young people can live a very long time on feeding tubes.</p><p>Terri Schiavo has already lived a third of her life on tubes. If she can avoid bedsores and infections, ''I don't think anyone can put a limit on how long she can live,'' said Robert Walker, director of the division of medical ethics and humanities at the University of South Florida College of Medicine.</p><p>The law passed by the Florida Legislature, and Governor Bush's order, do not seem likely to stand in court. But if they do, or if Michael Schiavo decides to relinquish guardianship, Bob and Mary Schindler could very well have their daughter for the rest of their lives.</p><p>As Mrs. Foster said, ''You need to be careful what you pray for.''</p><p>Drawing (Drawing by Ingo Fast)</p>                </div>
