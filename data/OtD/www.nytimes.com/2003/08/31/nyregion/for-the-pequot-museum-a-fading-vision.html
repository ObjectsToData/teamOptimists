                    <p>AT the Foxwoods Resort Casino, a $99 million expansion is under way, the first addition in several years at what is already the world's largest casino. The 120,000-square-foot project, however, has some observers worried about the lack of growth at another ambitious enterprise operated by the Mashantucket Pequots: the Mashantucket Museum and Research Center.</p><p>''Clearly there is not the commitment today as there once was,'' said Stuart Parnes, executive director of the Connecticut River Museum in Essex. ''They had a spectacular vision.</p><p>''All of us thought that money would not be a problem for them and they could fulfill dreams that the rest of us could only imagine.''</p><p>The disappointment stems from high expectations at the outset of the museum project. Just before the museum opened five years ago, a hard-hat tour of the construction site was conducted and museum experts and critics were in awe. No one had built a museum of that scale without outside help: a $193.4 million investment, 308,000 square feet, a research center and a life-sized village.</p>                </div>

                    <p>''It was all very exciting,'' said Steven Young, who at the time was the president of the Connecticut League of History Organizations. ''From what we saw, and as we talked to staffers and contractors, it appeared as though they had not overlooked anything.''</p><p>Richard Hayward, the former tribal council chairman known as Skip, had wanted the museum to tell the tribe's history long before there was a casino or its annual $1 billion in revenues. Casino profits helped bring his dream alive, but the money isn't flowing as freely toward the museum these days.</p><p>While Mr. Parnes and other observers still rave about the museum, they say it has been difficult to watch the Mashantucket Pequots shift dollars away from it.</p><p>John Guevremont, the Mashantuckets' chief of staff, acknowledged that tribal members were ''reallocating their priorities,'' but he declined to go into detail.</p><p>''Clearly we want to maximize our return and minimize our loss,'' he said. ''How far we have deviated from our intended course is an ongoing debate.''</p><p>Mr. Guevremont said that only a handful of museums nationwide turned a profit.</p><p>''All the rest struggle to meet their budgetary needs and run at a deficit,'' he said. ''That deficit has to be made up by private donations, government support or a combination of all the above. We're not different in that regard.''</p><p>In February, Michael Thomas, the tribal council chairman, proposed moving tribal government offices to the museum, partly to justify its nearly $20 million annual budget, $11 million in interest and more than $8 million in operating costs.</p><p>David Holahan, a museum spokesman, said the tribal council had asked the museum to assess the potential impact of such a move.</p><p>''The Museum and Research Center is successfully fulfilling its original mission of informing and engaging the public about the Mashantucket Pequot story and the histories and cultures of other Native people of the United States and Canada,'' he said in a prepared statement. ''Senior staff periodically examine ways to enhance and to update the existing permanent exhibits.''</p><p>Still, museum experts had hoped to see more national academic conferences held at the museum and also expected more American Indian historic material from across the nation to be archived at the research center.</p><p>Only 600 feet from the museum is the site of a former 17th-century Pequot fort, one of only a half-dozen American Indian forts identified in New England, according to the tribe.</p><p>Plans to rebuild the fort and build a trail connecting it to the museum have not been realized. Academic workshops and archaeological surveys are occasionally held there, but the footpath to the site is not part of the museum tour.</p><p>Also, an elevator to a 185-foot-tall stone and glass observation tower has been out of order for two years. It is due for repairs, though a date has not been scheduled yet.</p><p>A monorail to transport casino patrons from Foxwoods to the museum similarly never materialized.</p><p>''It's a different audience,'' Mr. Guevremont said of the museum and casino patrons.</p><p>Even though the two sites are less than a mile apart and a shuttle runs every 20 minutes, the tribe has found that regular casino patrons make it to the museum only once a year.</p><p>Most visitors are tourists from between Washington and Cape Cod, students and people who live nearby. About 225,000 people -- 68,000 of them students or adults in educational groups -- visited the museum in 2002. The figure is 4 percent less than the 2001 museum attendance of 235,000 and 33 percent less than the opening-year attendance of 300,000. The museum's goal is to increase attendance by 25,000 a year.</p><p>Peter Glankoff, Mystic Seaport communications director, said the Indian museum was the kind of top-notch attraction that should easily attract thousands more than its goal.</p><p>He dismissed an argument that the museum suffered from not having enough road signs and from being in an out-of-the-way location -- at least compared to big-city museums. He said the museum could generate enough buzz to overcome those obstacles.</p><p>''Ninety-nine percent of the effort has been put behind the for-profit business and very little energy has been put behind the museum,'' he said. ''A lot of the family and inner rivalry has interfered with the museum.''</p><p>Mr. Guevremont, the Mashantuckets' chief of staff, said tribal members had been sensitive about representation of their families in the exhibitions. He said some exhibitions may need to be changed.</p><p>''One of the things that hasn't been done is to tell the story of some of the other families,'' he said. ''It was never intended to be that way. Now it's time to freshen it up with what has yet to be told of a couple of more families and move on in the cycle.''</p><p>He also said the museum should coordinate its marketing with Mystic Seaport and the Mystic Aquarium.</p><p>Mystic Seaport, the largest maritime museum in North America, has not had contact with the Mashantucket museum for six months, Mr. Glankoff said.</p><p>''We don't know who to talk to,'' he said. ''They are not in the game. You could do all kinds of amazing packages that would result in richer, deeper and longer-term stays.''</p><p>Bruce Fraser, the director of the Connecticut Humanities Council in Middletown, said that the museum may be in transition, but things could be worse.</p><p>''In the past four or five years a lot of traditional cultural organizations in Connecticut have gone belly-up,'' he said.</p><p>The Hartford Ballet and the Hartford Symphony are barely making it, he added.</p><p>The state Attorney General's Office has informed the humanities council, the state affiliate of the National Endowment of Humanities, that it cannot award grants to the Mashantuckets until the tribe established an employment code of regulations that is approved by the state.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Fraser said the museum was a public asset that deserved support to keep it going.</p><p>''I think it's clearly a place that has struggled,'' he said. ''One would have hoped they would have kept that initial dream alive, but it's not surprising that they ran into trouble. Everyone else did, too.''</p><p>Photos: From top: the main lobby of the Mashantucket Pequot Museum; and a still life installation on display.
