    <meta itemprop="description" name="description" content="Severe acute respiratory syndrome has infected nearly 3,000 people in 18 countries, and 111 people have died from it at the time of this writing. Public awareness of SARS has spread almost as fast as the disease. And fear and a search for scapegoats has come with it. My nephew in Singapore tells me that taxi drivers avoid picking up or dropping off people near hospitals. Because nurses were among the first to fall sick in Singapore, a dentist reportedly refused to see a nurse waiting in his office. Along with the isolation of those who are ill, countries have to make a decision about whether to quarantine people who are not ill but who might have been exposed.    ''Quarantine'' is a loaded word with metaphorical implications that many of us in America have fortunately forgotten. As the medical historian Howard Markel has noted, it derives from the Italian words quarantina and quaranta giorni, referring to the 40 days ships suspected of carrying plague were made to wait in the port of Venice before discharging their cargo. In America, the Federal Quarantine Legislation was passed in 1878, prompted by outbreaks of yellow fever. The power of quarantine was used vigorously, cruelly and arbitrarily during the New York City epidemics of typhus and cholera in 1892. (About 1,150 healthy people, mostly Russian Jews, were quarantined on North Brother Island, for example.) Fear of catching disease from immigrants (as well as fears of losing scarce jobs to them) caused citizens to rally against immigrants and immigration. Indeed, it is not far-fetched to think of race-based immigration bans as the ultimate form of quarantine.  ">

Indeed, it is not far-fetched to think of race-based immigration bans as the ultimate form of quarantine.</p><p>In America, as of April 11, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended isolation for those who are ill with SARS but not quarantine; that idea does not sit well with our country's values. Given the lightninglike spread of SARS within a hospital, and given the way SARS has caused deaths in physicians and nurses caring for patients, I think we will regret our unwillingness to quarantine those who have been exposed. Singapore's authoritarian government had no such qualms. Cosmopolitan Hong Kong, on the other hand, a more enlightened, democratic society, did not quarantine at first. SARS spread more rapidly in Hong Kong.</p><p>As I make my hospital rounds with my team of medical students, residents and interns, I am reminded of the now well-described outbreak of SARS in a Hong Kong hospital. A patient was admitted for what looked like garden-variety pneumonia, the sort seen every day in large city hospitals. But then the staff treating the patient began to fall ill, as did others in close proximity. Eventually, 138 other people in that hospital caught the pneumonia from the patient, including 20 doctors, 34 nurses, 15 related health-care workers and 16 medical students. I have tried to imagine how the hospital must have been transformed, with health-care workers lying beside former patients, and it seems inevitable that an American hospital will soon face this problem on this scale. Were I to examine a patient and then decide he almost certainly had SARS -- we badly need an early, definitive diagnostic test -- I would not feel comfortable going home and possibly exposing my family to infection. The short history of SARS tells us that health-care workers seem to amplify this illness. I would rather stay in the hospital. The logistics of keeping a health-care team confined at work for 10 days or more is nightmarish. But the way the illness has cut down families, the heartbreaking stories of young doctors and nurses dying, then their loved ones dying, is a worse nightmare. It would justify this self-imposed draconian measure.</p>                </div>

                    <p>We are privileged to live in a free society where we have privacy (but not anonymity) and freedom to travel. But SARS may change that; highly contagious diseases pit individual rights against the public-health imperative. Historically, as with diseases like tuberculosis, public welfare wins out: you may believe your TB is your business, but a court order can nonetheless hospitalize you and force you to stop spreading the infection and to take conventional drugs. With SARS, already we are being warned against going to Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Vietnam. SARS comes at a time when we are also under a high-level terror alert, which is further inhibiting travel. Indeed, there are strong parallels between our response to terrorism and our response to a new contagion: both are characterized by anti-immigrant sentiment, the curtailing of certain freedoms in travel, the registering and tracking of the movements of foreigners.</p><p>Recently, we in America have sensed our right to privacy eroding, along with our rights to due process. The justification that such loss of liberty directly improves homeland security is not readily apparent, and it seems quite self-serving. But the virus that causes SARS has no political agenda, no jingoist banner to wave, and it has not read John Stuart Mill's ''On Liberty.'' The virus is democratic to its core, affecting rich and poor, doctor and patient, crossing borders with impunity and thus freezing commerce, threatening a global recession. The temporary loss of liberty that might come with quarantine for SARS, while painful, is a pill that I would find easier to swallow.</p><p>Photo (Justin Guariglia; Contact Press Images)    Chart: ''LOCKDOWN BACK IN THE DAY''  ''It is true that the locking up the doors of people's houses, and setting a watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any coming to them . . . looked very hard and cruel; and many people perished in these miserable confinements which, 'tis reasonable to believe, would not have been distempered if they had had liberty, though the plague was in the house; at which the people were very clamorous and uneasy at first, and several violences were committed and injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the houses so shut up. . . . But it was a public good that justified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the least mitigation by any application to magistrates or government at that time, at least not that I heard of. This put the people upon all manner of stratagem in order, if possible, to get out.''   From ''A Journal of the Plague Year'' (1722), by Daniel Defoe    </p>                </div>
