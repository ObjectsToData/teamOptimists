                    <p>BENEDICT ARNOLD was America's most famous traitor, but some in Connecticut hope that he can serve his country, or at least his state, by luring tourists here to learn about his story.</p><p>From Wednesday through next Sunday, a drama about Arnold, ''Benedict Arnold: A Brave Revenge,'' will be staged in Washington Park in Groton, two blocks from where a small band of Colonial troops led by Col. William Ledyard was defeated at Fort Griswold by Arnold's British forces on Sept. 6, 1781. The production is part of Groton's centennial celebration.</p><p>The drama was written by John Basinger, a retired theater professor at Mohegan Community College in Norwich, Arnold's birthplace, with music by Neely Bruce, a professor at Wesleyan University. Its production is a result of years of work by Mr. Basinger and David Holdridge, a retired history and political science professor at Mohegan. Both men have a passion for outdoor historic drama, a thriving segment of the performing arts industry that has yet to make inroads in Connecticut.</p><p>Outdoor historic drama is its own genre -- a combination of pageantry, spectacle, music, dance, drama and history. These productions are staged in 37 states, said Scott J. Parker, director of the Institute of Outdoor Drama at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which was founded in 1963 and works with communities or nonprofit groups trying to put on the shows.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The first outdoor historic drama, Mr. Parker believes, was ''The Lost Colony,'' the story of the mysterious colony of Roanoke. It was first presented in 1937 in North Carolina, and is still seen today. The genre took off after World War II, said Josh Gilliam, marketing director for "The Lost Colony" production, as the tourism industry grew and American families began taking car trips across the nation.</p><p>Mr. Parker said a big appeal of the dramas is that they are entertainment for an entire family. He added that they were more likely to succeed if they were presented at or near where the events depicted happened so that tourists can get a flavor of the historic setting.</p><p>Mr. Parker said the institute works with 30 to 40 towns at a time to develop outdoor historic dramas.</p><p>Subjects range from the story of the Mormon settlement in Utah and the longstanding Hatfield-McCoy feud in West Virginia to the lives of notable figures like Helen Keller and Laura Ingalls Wilder.</p><p>The productions employ 5,000 nationwide, attract 2.5 million tourists each summer to various amphitheaters and have a $500 million annual economic impact on the United States, according to institute statistics.</p><p>In 1996, an institute study, paid for with money from the state and from Mr. Holdridge and Mr. Basinger, concluded that outdoor historic drama in southeastern Connecticut could bring in $20 million a year to the region, which is already home to other major tourist attractions -- for example, two Indian casinos, Mystic Seaport and MarineLife Aquarium -- and many hotels and restaurants.</p><p>Mr. Holdridge and Mr. Basinger became interested in outdoor historic drama on a vacation in Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio a decade ago when they saw the production about Roanoke as well as one about the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. They decided that tales from Connecticut's history would also make a compelling stage production.</p><p>By 1994, they settled on what they believed was the perfect subject -- the story of Arnold, the brilliant Colonial military leader who betrayed his fledgling country by resigning from the Continental Army during the American Revolution and accepting a British military commission in 1779.</p><p>Mr. Basinger, who researched and wrote the play from 1994 to 1996 with the assistance of a state grant, said the production's highlight is its depiction of the burning of New London and the Battle of Groton Heights at Fort Griswold. Mr. Arnold's troops burned the city of New London on the east side of the Thames River and captured Fort Griswold on the west side of the river.</p><p>''The dramatic highlight is the confrontation of Arnold and the people of New London,'' Mr. Basinger said. ''He came home a hero first, and then he came home an enemy.''</p><p>The men hope the production will be the first step in pursuing their dream to establish a permanent home for outdoor historic drama in New England. In 1997, they formed Connecticut Outdoor Historic Drama, a nonprofit group devoted to this goal.</p><p>The idea is that a 15-acre site on land in Ledyard owned by Mr. Holdridge's family would be leased to the group for $1 a year. A 1,500-seat amphitheater, budgeted to cost $5.7 million, would be built there. The money, the men hope, would come from the state, private donors and local corporations.</p><p>The men also hope that the skeleton of the permanent amphitheater will be built by next summer so the Benedict Arnold drama could be staged six nights a week for 10 weeks.</p><p>The presentation of the drama this week will inaugurate a fundraising drive for the permanent amphitheater. The production alone will cost about $126,000. The group received a $25,000 grant from the Connecticut Humanities Council, as well as local foundation grants and corporate sponsorships to make the staging possible.</p><p>''We had received some good developmental money,'' Mr. Holdridge said. ''But at a certain point, we knew we needed to let the world see what we are talking about.''</p><p>With tickets selling, actors and actresses in place, musicians ready and a stage built, Mr. Holdridge said he still has a difficult time believing that his dream is becoming reality.</p><p>''On opening night, I doubt I'll be able to say anything worth quoting,'' he said.</p><p>For information on ''Benedict Arnold: A Brave Revenge'': benedictarnold.net.</p><p>Photos: Benedict Arnold will be back in Connecticut, as a sign on Thames Street in Groton, left, announces. But this time he will be a character in an outdoor historic drama to be performed in Washington Park in Groton, above. The play was written by John Basinger, below left, who, with David Holdridge, hopes to build an amphitheater in which to present outdoor historic drama in Connecticut. (Photographs by C.M.
