According to relatives and other young people gathered on City Island last night, Mr. Wertenbaker is a student at the Bronx High School of Science, and the three other boys attend Humanities Preparatory Academy in Manhattan.</p>                </div>

                    <p>The police quickly established that an eight-foot fiberglass rowboat was missing from a nearby marina, Barron's Boat Yard. The boat was believed to have been taken by the boys.</p><p>At a news conference last night, Deputy Chief Joseph J. Reznick, the commander of Bronx detectives, said the search centered on High Island, a tiny spit of land connected to City Island by a boardwalk, and Hart Island, the site of the city's Potter's Field burial ground for the indigent and an old Nike missile battery from the 1950's.</p><p>Several teenagers, some of whom had attended the party with the four young men on Friday night, lingered last night near a dock at the end of Fordham Street, where the police had set up a command post. The teenagers said no one had actually seen the boys row out to sea, but they believed that Hart Island would have been the most likely destination in such an adventure.</p><p>They said the four missing youths had mentioned the island in conversation at the party. Besides, they said, with its storied graveyard and abandoned missile silos, Hart Island holds a ghoulish fascination for many teenagers.</p><p>The relatives said the four youths had a special bond because they were planning to start a rock band. Mr. Wertenbaker and Mr. Melnikov had been members of a band called Nowhere, which disbanded, the acquaintances said, and Mr. Melnikov had transferred from the Bronx High School of Science to Humanities Prep, where he befriended Mr. Guarino and Mr. Badillo.</p><p>Mr. Wertenbaker's father, Dr. Christian Wertenbaker, is a Manhattan physician. He was at the command post early last night, but declined to comment.</p><p>Elena Wertenbaker, 13, Charles' sister, said she remained hopeful that the boys would survive their ordeal. ''They are probably out there unconscious or something, but God knows where,'' she said.</p><p>Virginia Badillo, Henry's mother, said she had first become alarmed yesterday morning when she called the Wertenbaker home, thinking that her son had slept there on Friday night. But she said she was told that Henry was not there.</p><p>Then, she said, ''I called his cell phone and he never called back.'' Ms. Badillo added, ''He always calls back, sometimes late, but he always calls back.''</p><p>According to young people who said they had attended the party on Friday night, none of the four missing boys had been drinking or taking drugs.</p><p>Investigators said they began their search about noon yesterday after receiving calls from members of the boys' families.</p><p>They said a trail of evidence was quickly established. The acoustic guitar, belonging to Mr. Wertenbaker, was found in Pelham Cemetery, near the shore on City Island. Elena Wertenbaker said the cemetery was well known to her brother, who frequently went there to practice and contemplate his music.</p><p>A police dog was brought in and established a scent from the guitar and the ground around it. The dog led detectives to the water's edge, suggesting that the boys had climbed into a boat.</p><p>After visiting several marinas on City Island, detectives learned that the rowboat was missing.</p><p>Some relatives and acquaintances speculated early last night that the boys might have rowed to Hart Island, and found shelter inside one of the underground silos that once housed the Nike missiles. But that hope appeared dashed shortly after 8 p.m. when members of a police search team returned from Hart Island, saying they had searched the silos and found no sign of the boys.</p><p>Chief Reznick said the search, which was joined by boats, helicopters and airplanes from Nassau County and the Coast Guard, would continue through last night. Shortly before 10 p.m., the searchers could be seen shooting flares from helicopters to illuminate broad sections of Hart Island, High Island and the waters around them.</p><p>The searchers were also using ultraviolet instruments on their aircraft to seek signs of life on the islands and in the water.</p><p>Chief Reznick said police scuba divers would be brought in to join the search at the first light this morning.</p><p>Photos: A police command center was set up yesterday on a dock at the end of Fordham Street on City Island.
